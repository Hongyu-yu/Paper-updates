# Multi-objective Bayesian Optimisation of Spinodoid Cellular Structures for Crush Energy Absorption

## 用于压碎能量吸收的棘突细胞细胞结构的多目标贝叶斯优化

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14508

arXiv:2411.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing structures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance while balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy absorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world conditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the non-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant computational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to optimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid structures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and efficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced structural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush performance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic conditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often require a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions, making the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context, multi-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by intelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to reduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the complexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element analysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study tackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak force, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical role. The use of scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques enables the identification of Pareto-optimal solutions, balancing these conflicting objectives.

arXiv:2411.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising accident tolerant fuel due to its high fissile density and high thermal conductivity. In this study, we developed the first machine learning interatomic potentials for reliable atomic-scale modeling of UN at finite temperatures. We constructed a training set using density functional theory (DFT) calculations that was enriched through an active learning procedure and two neural network potentials were generated. We found that both potentials can reproduce some thermophysical properties of interest such as temperature dependent heat capacity. We also evaluated the energy of stoichiometric defect reactions and defect migration barriers and found close agreement with DFT values demonstrating that our potentials can be used for a description of defects in UN.

Abstract: Electrochemical processes play a crucial role in energy storage and conversion systems, yet their computational modeling remains a significant challenge. Accurately incorporating the effects of electric potential has been a central focus in theoretical electrochemistry. Although constant-potential ab initio molecular dynamics (CP-AIMD) has provided valuable insights, it is limited by its substantial computational demands. Here, we introduce the Explicit Electric Potential Machine Learning Force Field (EEP-MLFF) model. Our model integrates the electric potential as an explicit input parameter along with the atom-centered descriptors in the atomic neural network. This approach enables the evaluation of nuclear forces under arbitrary electric potentials, thus facilitating molecular dynamics simulations at a specific potential. By applying the proposed machine learning method to the Cu/1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_{2}$ system, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the potential-modulated Cu atom migration and aggregation lead to the formation of small steric Cu clusters (Single Clusters, SCs) at potentials below -0.1 V. The morphological transformations of adsorbed Cu atoms are elucidated through electronic structure analyses, which demonstrates that both Cu-S and Cu-Cu bonding can be effectively tuned by the applied electric potential. Our findings present an opportunity for the convenient manufacture of single metal cluster catalysts through potential modulation. Moreover, this theoretical framework facilitates the exploration of potential-regulated processes and helps investigate the mechanisms of electrochemical reactions.

# Automatic virtual voltage extraction of a 2x2 array of quantum dots with machine learning

## 基于机器学习的2x2量子点阵列虚拟电压自动提取

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03685

arXiv:2012.03685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin qubits in quantum dots are a compelling platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to the potential to fabricate dense two-dimensional arrays with nearest neighbour couplings, a requirement to implement the surface code. However, due to the proximity of the surface gate electrodes, cross-coupling capacitances can be substantial, making it difficult to control each quantum dot independently. Increasing the number of quantum dots increases the complexity of the calibration process, which becomes impractical to do heuristically. Inspired by recent demonstrations of industrial-grade silicon quantum dot bilinear arrays, we develop a theoretical framework to mitigate the effect of cross-capacitances in 2x2 arrays of quantum dots and extend it to 2xN and NxN arrays. The method is based on extracting the gradients in gate-voltage space of different charge transitions in multiple two-dimensional charge stability diagrams to determine the system's virtual gates. To automate the process, we train an ensemble of regression models to extract the gradients from a Hough transformation of charge stability diagrams and validate the algorithm on simulated and experimental data of a 2x2 quantum dot array. Our method provides a completely automated tool to mitigate cross-capacitance effects in arrays of QDs which could be utilised to study variability in device electrostatics across large arrays.

# Lattice Boltzmann simulations for soft flowing matter

## 软流动物质的格子Boltzmann模拟

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14551

arXiv:2405.14551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Lattice Boltzmann method has found major scope for the simulation of a large spectrum of problems in soft matter, from multiphase and multi-component microfluidic flows, to foams, emulsions, colloidal flows, to name but a few. Crucial to many such applications is the role of supramolecular interactions which occur whenever mesoscale structures, such as bubbles or droplets, come in close contact, say of the order of tens of nanometers. Regardless of their specific physico-chemical origin, such near-contact interactions are vital to preserve the coherence of the mesoscale structures against coalescence phenomena promoted by capillarity and surface tension, hence the need of including them in Lattice Boltzmann schemes. Strictly speaking, this entails a complex multiscale problem, covering about six spatial decades, from centimeters down to tens of nanometers, and almost twice as many in time. Such a multiscale problem can hardly be taken by a single computational method, hence the need for coarse-grained models for the near-contact interactions. In this review, we shall discuss such coarse-grained models and illustrate their application to a variety of soft flowing matter problems, such as soft flowing crystals, strongly confined dense emulsions, flowing hierarchical emulsions, soft granular flows, as well as the transmigration of active droplets across constrictions. Finally, we conclude with a few considerations on future developments in the direction of quantum-nanofluidics, machine learning, and quantum computing for soft flows applications.

Abstract: Two-dimensional layered materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), possess intrinsic van der Waals gap at the layer interface allowing for remarkable tunability of the optoelectronic features via external intercalation of foreign guests such as atoms, ions, or molecules. Herein, we introduce a high-throughput, data-driven computational framework for the design of novel quantum materials derived from intercalating planar conjugated organic molecules into bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and dioxides. By combining first-principles methods, material informatics, and machine learning, we characterize the energetic and mechanical stability of this new class of materials and identify the fifty (50) most stable hybrid materials from a vast configurational space comprising $\sim 10^5$ materials, employing intercalation energy as the screening criterion.

# The effect of color-coding on students' perception of learning in introductory mechanics

## 颜色编码对学生对入门力学学习感知的影响

arXiv:2411.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed three color-coding schemes to identify related information across representations and to differentiate distinct information within a representation in slide-based instruction for calculus-based introductory mechanics. We found that students had generally favorable opinions on the use of color and that the few negative criticisms are easily addressed through minor modifications to implementation. Without having the color-coding schemes pointed out to them, a modest but consistent minority of students who found color helpful also described the color-coding schemes implemented, and about a quarter described the use of color in physics contexts as helpful even if they did not describe color-coding. We found that students particularly favored using color in mathematics and color-coding used to identify related variables, verbal definitions, and diagram elements. We additionally found that on average 40% of students found color to be helpful in matching and connecting related information or in separating and distinguishing distinct information, which were the motivating reasons for employing the color-coding schemes.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal magnetic field variations from B0-inhomogeneity and diffusion-encoding-induced eddy-currents can be detrimental to rapid image-encoding schemes such as spiral, EPI and 3D-cones, resulting in undesirable image artifacts.

The method was applied to single-shot spiral diffusion MRI at high b-values where accurate estimation of B0 and eddy were obtained, resulting in high quality image reconstruction without need for additional external calibrations.

# Quantum mechanical deconstruction of vibrational energy transfer rate and pathways modified by collective vibrational strong coupling

arXiv:2411.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrations and the optical cavity field can modify vibrational energy transfer (VET) processes in molecular systems. However, the underlying mechanisms and the behavior of individual molecules under collective VSC remain largely incomplete. In this work, we combine state-of-the-art quantum vibrational spectral calculation, quantum wavepacket dynamics simulations, and ab initio machine-learning potential to elucidate how the vibrational dynamics of water OH stretches can be altered by VSC. Taking the (H$_2$O)$_{21}$-cavity system as an example, we show that the collective VSC breaks the localization picture, promotes the delocalization of OH stretches, and opens new intermolecular vibrational energy pathways involving both neighboring and remote water molecules. The manipulation of the VET process relies on the alignment of the transition dipole moment orientations of the corresponding vibrational states. The emergence of new energy transfer pathways is found to be attributed to cavity-induced vibrational resonance involving OH stretches across different water molecules, along with alterations in mode coupling patterns. Our fully quantum theoretical calculations not only confirm and extend previous findings on cavity-modified energy transfer processes but also provide new insights in energy transfer processes under collective VSC.

# Exploring the Use of Machine Learning Weather Models in Data Assimilation

## 探索机器学习天气模型在数据同化中的应用

arXiv:2411.14677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) models in meteorology has attracted significant attention for their potential to improve weather forecasting efficiency and accuracy. GraphCast and NeuralGCM, two promising ML-based weather models, are at the forefront of this innovation. However, their suitability for data assimilation (DA) systems, particularly for four-dimensional variational (4DVar) DA, remains under-explored. This study evaluates the tangent linear (TL) and adjoint (AD) models of both GraphCast and NeuralGCM to assess their viability for integration into a DA framework.
  We compare the TL/AD results of GraphCast and NeuralGCM with those of the Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A), a well-established numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. The comparison focuses on the physical consistency and reliability of TL/AD responses to perturbations. While the adjoint results of both GraphCast and NeuralGCM show some similarity to those of MPAS-A, they also exhibit unphysical noise at various vertical levels, raising concerns about their robustness for operational DA systems.
  The implications of this study extend beyond 4DVar applications. Unphysical behavior and noise in ML-derived TL/AD models could lead to inaccurate error covariances and unreliable ensemble forecasts, potentially degrading the overall performance of ensemble-based DA systems, as well. Addressing these challenges is critical to ensuring that ML models, such as GraphCast and NeuralGCM, can be effectively integrated into operational DA systems, paving the way for more accurate and efficient weather predictions.

Abstract: Silicon Photonics-based AI Accelerators (SPAAs) have been considered as promising AI accelerators achieving high energy efficiency and low latency. While many researchers focus on improving SPAAs' energy efficiency and latency, their physical security has not been sufficiently studied. This paper first proposes a threat of thermal fault injection attacks on SPAAs based on Vector-Matrix Multipliers (VMMs) utilizing Mach-Zhender Interferometers. This paper then proposes SecONN, an optical neural network framework that is capable of not only inferences but also concurrent detection of the attacks. In addition, this paper introduces a concept of Wavelength Division Perturbation (WDP) where wavelength dependent VMM results are utilized to increase detection accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves 88.7% attack-caused average misprediction recall.

arXiv:2411.14853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wheatstone bridge experiment is a fundamental component of the undergraduate physics curriculum, traditionally taught as a hands-on activity to explore resistance measurement and circuit balancing. This study introduces a pedagogical approach that combines qualitative symmetry-based analysis with quantitative computer-based sensitivity simulations, enhancing students' understanding and engagement. A key focus is demonstrating how balanced configurations in the Wheatstone bridge affect circuit sensitivity, providing students with an intuitive grasp of the relationship between symmetry and measurement accuracy. Using simulations, we investigate the impact of internal resistances in the galvanometer and power supply, showing that lower resistances increase the circuit's sensitivity to minor resistance changes. Additionally, various resistor configurations are analyzed, highlighting the effect of careful adjustments in achieving maximal sensitivity. A Bayesian optimization-based software tool was developed to guide students in selecting optimal component values, thereby minimizing the need for manual adjustments while ensuring accurate measurements. This integrated approach bridges traditional experimentation with computational techniques, fostering critical thinking and preparing students for modern scientific practices. The study demonstrates that this enriched methodology significantly enhances the learning experience, equipping students with valuable skills in both experimental and computational aspects of physics.

# Deep operator network models for predicting post-burn contraction

## 用于预测烧伤后收缩的深度算子网络模型

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14555

arXiv:2411.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burn injuries present a significant global health challenge. Among the most severe long-term consequences are contractures, which can lead to functional impairments and disfigurement. Understanding and predicting the evolution of post-burn wounds is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Traditional mathematical models, while accurate, are often computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting their practical application. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in deep learning, offer promising alternatives for accelerating these predictions. This study explores the use of a deep operator network (DeepONet), a type of neural operator, as a surrogate model for finite element simulations, aimed at predicting post-burn contraction across multiple wound shapes. A DeepONet was trained on three distinct initial wound shapes, with enhancement made to the architecture by incorporating initial wound shape information and applying sine augmentation to enforce boundary conditions. The performance of the trained DeepONet was evaluated on a test set including finite element simulations based on convex combinations of the three basic wound shapes. The model achieved an $R^2$ score of $0.99$, indicating strong predictive accuracy and generalization. Moreover, the model provided reliable predictions over an extended period of up to one year, with speedups of up to 128-fold on CPU and 235-fold on GPU, compared to the numerical model. These findings suggest that DeepONets can effectively serve as a surrogate for traditional finite element methods in simulating post-burn wound evolution, with potential applications in medical treatment planning.

# What You See is Not What You Get: Neural Partial Differential Equations and The Illusion of Learning

arXiv:2411.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable Programming for scientific machine learning (SciML) has recently seen considerable interest and success, as it directly embeds neural networks inside PDEs, often called as NeuralPDEs, derived from first principle physics. Therefore, there is a widespread assumption in the community that NeuralPDEs are more trustworthy and generalizable than black box models. However, like any SciML model, differentiable programming relies predominantly on high-quality PDE simulations as "ground truth" for training. However, mathematics dictates that these are only discrete numerical approximations of the true physics. Therefore, we ask: Are NeuralPDEs and differentiable programming models trained on PDE simulations as physically interpretable as we think? In this work, we rigorously attempt to answer these questions, using established ideas from numerical analysis, experiments, and analysis of model Jacobians. Our study shows that NeuralPDEs learn the artifacts in the simulation training data arising from the discretized Taylor Series truncation error of the spatial derivatives. Additionally, NeuralPDE models are systematically biased, and their generalization capability is likely enabled by a fortuitous interplay of numerical dissipation and truncation error in the training dataset and NeuralPDE, which seldom happens in practical applications. This bias manifests aggressively even in relatively accessible 1-D equations, raising concerns about the veracity of differentiable programming on complex, high-dimensional, real-world PDEs, and in dataset integrity of foundation models. Further, we observe that the initial condition constrains the truncation error in initial-value problems in PDEs, thereby exerting limitations to extrapolation. Finally, we demonstrate that an eigenanalysis of model weights can indicate a priori if the model will be inaccurate for out-of-distribution testing.

# Course Deficit Model and the CLASP curriculum: Examining equity and graduation rates at two institutions

arXiv:2408.11964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have previously described the reformed introductory physics course, Collaborative Learning through Active Sense-Making in Physics (CLASP), for bioscience students at a large public research one university (Original University) and presented evidence that the course was more successful and more equitable than the course it replaced by several measures. Now we compare the original success of CLASP with an implementation at a second institution. We find that the original results hold at another institution despite some changes to the original curriculum and a somewhat different student population. We find that students who take CLASP are 1) less likely to drop, 2) less likely to fail, and 3) do as well in later coursework when compared to students who took the courses that CLASP replaced, even if that coursework is not similarly reformed. We find the above items to be independently true for historically marginalized students and remarkably, also find that 4) marginalized students who take CLASP are more likely to graduate from a STEM field. We use a course deficit model perspective to examine these results, and discuss some of the factors that may have contributed to this success. We argue that higher education has the tools they need to significantly increase equity, and improve student success and retention.

Abstract: In the domain of geometry and topology optimization, discovering geometries that optimally satisfy specific problem criteria is a complex challenge in both engineering and scientific research. In this work, we propose a new approach for the creation of multidomain connected geometries that are designed to work with automatic differentiation. We introduce the concept of differentiable Connected Geometries (dCG), discussing its theoretical aspects and illustrating its application through a simple toy examples and a more sophisticated photonic optimization task.

This methodology provides a systematic way to approach geometric design and optimization in computational fields involving dependent geometries, potentially improving the efficiency and effectiveness of optimization tasks in scientific and engineering applications.

arXiv:2312.09384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling epidemic spread is critical for informing policy decisions aimed at mitigation. Accordingly, in this work we present a new data-driven method based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to model epidemic spread through the difference on the logarithmic scale of the infected cases. We bound the variance of the predictions made by GPR, which quantifies the impact of epidemic data on the proposed model. Next, we derive a high-probability error bound on the prediction error in terms of the distance between the training points and a testing point, the posterior variance, and the level of change in the spreading process, and we assess how the characteristics of the epidemic spread and infection data influence this error bound. We present examples that use GPR to model and predict epidemic spread by using real-world infection data gathered in the UK during the COVID-19 epidemic. These examples illustrate that, under typical conditions, the prediction for the next twenty days has 94.29% of the noisy data located within the 95% confidence interval, validating these predictions. We further compare the modeling and prediction results with other methods, such as polynomial regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and neural networks, to demonstrate the benefits of leveraging GPR in disease spread modeling.

Regardless of their specific physico-chemical origin, such near-contact interactions are vital to preserve the coherence of the mesoscale structures against coalescence phenomena promoted by capillarity and surface tension, hence the need of including them in Lattice Boltzmann schemes. Strictly speaking, this entails a complex multiscale problem, covering about six spatial decades, from centimeters down to tens of nanometers, and almost twice as many in time. Such a multiscale problem can hardly be taken by a single computational method, hence the need for coarse-grained models for the near-contact interactions. In this review, we shall discuss such coarse-grained models and illustrate their application to a variety of soft flowing matter problems, such as soft flowing crystals, strongly confined dense emulsions, flowing hierarchical emulsions, soft granular flows, as well as the transmigration of active droplets across constrictions. Finally, we conclude with a few considerations on future developments in the direction of quantum-nanofluidics, machine learning, and quantum computing for soft flows applications.

# An Automated Pynta-based Curriculum for ML-Accelerated Calculation of Transition States

## 基于Pynta的自动课程，用于过渡状态的ML加速计算

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-7d1z1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Microkinetic models (MKMs) are widely used within the computational heterogeneous catalysis community to investigate complex reaction mechanisms, rationalize experimental trends, and to accelerate the rational design of novel catalysts. However, constructing these models requires computationally expensive and manually tedious density functional theory (DFT) calculations for identifying transition states for each elementary reaction within the MKM. To address these challenges we demonstrate a novel protocol that uses the open-source kinetics workflow tool Pynta to automate the iterative training of a reactive machine learning potential (rMLP). Specifically, using the silver-catalyzed partial oxidation of methanol as a prototypical example, we first demonstrate our workflow by training an rMLP to accelerate the parallel calculation of DFT-quality transition states for all 53 reactions, achieving a 7x speedup compared to a DFT-only strategy. Detailed analysis of our training curriculum reveals the shortcomings of using an adaptive sampling scheme with a single rMLP model to describe all reactions within the MKM simultaneously. We show that these limitations can be overcome using a balanced "reaction class" approach that uses multiple rMLP models, each describing a single class of similar transition states. Finally, we demonstrate that our Pynta-based workflow is also compatible with large pre-trained foundational models. For example, by fine-tuning a top-performing graph neural network potential trained on the OC20 dataset, we observe an impressive 20x speedup with an 89\% success rate in identifying transition states. This work highlights the synergistic potential of integrating automated tools with machine learning to advance catalysis research.

# Examining proton conductivity of metal-organic frameworks by means of machine learning

## 通过机器学习检查金属有机框架的质子电导率

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tzs1z-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

The tunable structure of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is an ideal platform to meet contradictory requirements for proton exchange membranes: a key component of fuel cells. Nonetheless, rational design of proton-conducting MOFs remains a challenge owing to the intricate structure–property relationships that govern the target performance. In the present study, the modeling of quantities available for hundreds of MOFs was scaled up to many thousands of entities using supervised machine learning. The experimental dataset was curated to train multimodal transformer-based networks, which integrated crystal-graph, energy grid, and global-state embeddings. Uncertainty-aware models revealed superprotonic conductors among synthesized MOFs that have not been previously investigated for the application in question, thus highlighting magnesium-containing frameworks with aliphatic linkers as high-confidence candidates for experimental validation. Furthermore, classifiers trained on the activation energy threshold effectively discriminated between well-known proton conduction mechanisms, thereby providing physical insights beyond the black-box routine. Thus, our findings prove high potential of data-driven materials design, which is becoming a valuable addition to experimental studies on proton-conducting MOFs.

# Divergent Activity Shifts of Sn-Based Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: pH-Dependent Behavior of Single-Atom vs. Polyatomic Structures

## 用于电化学CO2还原的Sn基催化剂的不同活性变化: 单原子与多原子结构的pH依赖性行为

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-38nl4-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Tin (Sn)-based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce formic acid, but the intricate influence of the structural sensitivity in single-atom Sn (e.g., Sn-N-C) and polyatomic Sn (e.g., SnOx and SnSx; x=1,2) on their pH-dependent performance remains enigmatic. Herein, we integrate large-scale data mining (with >2,300 CO2RR catalysts from available experimental literature during the past decade), ab initio computations, machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamic simulations, and pH-field coupled microkinetic modelling to unravel their pH dependence. We reveal a fascinating contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn-N4-C and polyatomic Sn exhibits opposite behaviors due to their differing dipole moment changes upon *OCHO formation. Such response leads to an intriguing opposite pH-dependent volcano evolution for Sn-N4-C and polyatomic Sn. Subsequent experimental validations of turnover frequency and current density under both neutral and alkaline conditions well aligned with our theoretical predictions. Most importantly, our analysis suggests the necessity of distinct optimization strategies for *OCHO binding energy on different types of Sn-based catalysts.

# Elucidating structures from spectra using multimodal embeddings and discrete optimization

## 使用多模态嵌入和离散优化从光谱中阐明结构

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-f3b18-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Structure elucidation --- determining molecular structures from spectroscopic data -- remains one of chemistry's most fundamental and challenging tasks, essential for advancing fields from drug discovery to materials science. While machine learning approaches have attempted to automate this process, they typically focus on single spectroscopic techniques and lack crucial confidence metrics, limiting their practical utility. Here, we present spec2struct, a framework that synergistically combines multimodal embeddings, contrastive learning, and evolutionary algorithms to mimic how expert chemists approach structure determination. By aligning encoders for diverse spectroscopic techniques with molecular representations, our system can simultaneously interpret multiple types of spectroscopic evidence. This alignment guides genetic algorithms to evolve chemically valid candidates that best match the experimental data. spec2struct not only outperforms existing methods but also provides calibrated and contextualized confidence estimates. We demonstrate its real-world impact by identifying several published structures incorrectly assigned in the literature.  The combination of performance, reliability, and versatility positions spec2struct as a powerful tool for accelerating chemical discovery.

# SUANPAN: Scalable Photonic Linear Vector Machine

## SUANPAN: 可扩展的光子线性向量机

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5401152/latest

Photonic linear operation is a promising approach to handle the extensive vector multiplications in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques due to the natural bosonic parallelism and high-speed information transmission of photonics. However, there is still no universal scalable photonic computing architecture that can be readily merged with existing electronic digital computing system. Even though it is believed that maximizing the interaction of the light beams is necessary to fully utilize the parallelism and tremendous efforts have been made in past decades, the achieved dimensionality of vector-matrix multiplication is very limited due to the difficulty of scaling up a tightly interconnected or highly coupled optical system. Here, we propose a programmable and reconfigurable photonic linear vector machine to perform only the inner product of two vectors, formed by a series of independent basic computing units, while each unit contains only one emitter-detector pair. The elemental values of the processed vectors are prepared by the time-space domain encoding. Specifically, one vector is encoded by the output duration of continuous light-emitter while the other is encoded as the position of the emitter-detector pair. The result of the inner product is obtained by the sum of photocurrents of all photodetectors. Since there is no interaction among light beams inside, extreme scalability could be achieved by simply multiplicating the independent basic computing unit without requiring large-scale analog-to-digital converter or digital-to-analog converter arrays. Our time-space domain encoding architecture is inspired by the traditional Chinese Suanpan or abacus, and thus is denoted as photonic SUANPAN. As a proof of principle, SUANPAN architecture is implemented with an 8&times;8 vertical cavity surface emission laser (VCSEL) array and an 8&times;8 MoTe2 two-dimensional material photodetector array. The experimental computing fidelities for randomly generated vector inner products are all over 98% for 1-bit, 2-bit, 4-bit and 8-bit quantization and over 95% for 8~80 vector dimensionalities with 4-bit quantization. Two typical AI tasks of the Ising machine for non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard optimization problem and artificial neural network for visual perception are performed to demonstrate the ability of SUANPAN architecture. For the Ising problem, 1024-dimensional problems are successfully solved, which is the highest dimensional optical Ising machine with heuristic algorithm. For artificial neural network, a competitive classification accuracy of 84~88% is achieved for MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) handwritten digit dataset. We believe that our proposed photonic SUANPAN is capable of serving as a fundamental linear vector machine that can be readily merged with existing electronic digital computing system and is potential to enhance the computing power for future various AI applications.

Knowledge Tracing ( KT ) assesses students&rsquo; mastery of specific knowledge concepts and predicts their problem-solving abilities by analyzing their interactions with intelligent tutoring systems. Although recent years have seen significant improvements in tracking accuracy with the introduction of deep learning and graph neural network techniques, existing research has not sufficiently focused on the impact of difficulty on knowledge state. The text understanding difficulty and knowledge concept difficulty of programming problems are crucial for students&rsquo; responses; thus, accurately assessing these two types of difficulty and applying them to knowledge state prediction is a key challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a Difficulty-aware&nbsp;Programming Knowledge Tracing with Large Language Models&nbsp; ( DPKT ) to extract the text understanding difficulty and knowledge concept difficulty of programming problems. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between knowledge concept difficulty and&nbsp;text understanding difficulty using an attention mechanism, allowing for dynamic updates to students&rsquo; s. This model combines&nbsp;an update gate mechanism with a graph attention network, significantly improving the assessment accuracy of programming&nbsp;problem difficulty and the spatiotemporal reflection capability of knowledge state. Experimental results demonstrate that this&nbsp;model performs excellently across various language datasets, validating its application value in programming education. This&nbsp;model provides an innovative solution for programming knowledge tracing and offers educators a powerful tool to promote&nbsp;personalized learning.

# Auto-weighted sequential neural network and its application in shear wave velocity prediction

## 自动加权序贯神经网络及其在横波速度预测中的应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5230891/latest

Shear wave velocity is of great significance for accurate seismic data description and fluid tracking. However, the measurement of shear wave velocity is difficult, requiring high-precision equipment and professional operators. Conventional logging velocity often does not fully include the effective value of shear wave velocity, which brings serious challenges to the accurate exploration of oil and gas in deep strata. To meet demands of the industry, it is necessary to synthesize accurate shear wave logging from relevant conventional logging. Since the LSTM network is unable to compute sample points in parallel and has insufficient nonlinearity caused by sequential calculation, an auto-weighted sequence module is designed in this paper to extract context and better predict shear wave velocity. It takes each logging curve with a fixed step length to use a trainable matrix for auto-weighted rearrangement, and then uses the ELU function to activate. After the calculation of N such modules, the shear wave velocity is predicted by the fully connected layer. Comparing the prediction results of different methods, the auto-weighted neural network can indeed significantly improve the prediction accuracy, obtaining the highest accuracy with 39.21 of MAE and 0.9860 of R2. In addition, the proposal way is better than the LSTM network at different input lengths, with a significant improvement of about 5%. In conclusion, the proposed way can effectively extract the sequence information of the input data, thus it is an effective sequence modeling tool, which has good performance in the prediction of the shear wave.

# Automatic and accurate determination of defect size in shearography using U-Net deep learning network

## 使用u-net深度学习网络自动准确地确定shearography中的缺陷尺寸

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5156086/latest

Shearography, an effective non-destructive testing tool, is widely employed for detecting defects in composite materials. It detects internal defects by detecting deformation anomalies, offering advantages such as full-field, non-contact measurement, and high accuracy. Defect size is a critical parameter determining structure performance stability and service life. However, manual inspection is the primary method for defect size measurement in this technique, leading to inefficiency and low accuracy. To address this issue, this study established a defect recognition and high-precision automatic measurement method based on the U-Net deep learning network. First, a high-precision one-time calibration method for all system parameters was developed. Second, U-Net was employed to segment the measured image, identifying defect location and subimage. Finally, defect size was accurately calculated by combining calibration parameters and segmented defect subimage. The proposed method yielded a measurement error of less than 5% and a real-time dynamic detection rate of 14 fps, demonstrating potential for automated quantitative defect detection.

The escalating frequency and sophistication of ransomware attacks necessitate innovative detection methodologies. Traditional signature-based systems often falter against novel and polymorphic ransomware strains. Dynamic Polyvariant Heuristics (DPH) emerges as a novel approach, integrating dynamic analysis with machine learning to enhance detection capabilities. DPH systematically monitors system behaviors, extracting features indicative of ransomware activity, such as anomalous file modifications and network communications.

## 基于多源数据融合的电网级负荷预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5399298/latest

Grid-level dispatching is generally based on the accumulation of independent load forecasting data from provincial and municipal dispatch centers. However, the differences in economic development levels and the frequency of forecasting result updates among provinces and cities lead to certain limitations in the direct accumulation method, affecting the accuracy of the integrated forecasting results. To address this, this paper proposes a short-term load forecasting method for the power grid based on the i-Transformer model. First, the dataset is constructed through data preprocessing and feature engineering, followed by training and optimizing the model parameters. Further, considering the differences in forecasting results reported by provincial dispatch centers, principal component analysis is used to determine the weights of provinces and cities, thereby effectively integrating the forecasting data from different provinces and cities through weighting. The case study shows that the i-Transformer outperforms traditional statistical and machine learning algorithms on multiple evaluation metrics, and the integration method has considerable potential in handling multi-source heterogeneous data and improving forecasting accuracy. This paper provides a new means of load forecasting result integration for power grid dispatch centers, ensuring the safe, high-quality, and economical operation of the power system.

The increasing complexity and sophistication of modern cyber threats need innovative detection mechanisms capable of adapting to rapidly evolving attack vectors. A quantum-inspired framework was introduced to address the challenges of identifying ransomware through advanced decision-making algorithms and nonlinear entropy analysis. The integration of entropy mapping allowed the detection system to capture subtle deviations in system behavior, facilitating early-stage identification of malicious activities.

# Evaluation of fetal exposure to environmental noise using a computer-generated model

## 使用计算机生成的模型评估胎儿对环境噪声的暴露

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5397645/latest

Acoustic noise can have profound effects on wellbeing, impacting the health of the pregnant mother and the development of the fetus. Mounting evidence suggests neural memory traces are formed by auditory learning in utero. A better understanding of the fetal auditory environment is therefore critical to avoid exposure to damaging noise levels. Using anatomical data from MRI scans (N=3), we used a computational model to quantify the acoustic field inside the pregnant maternal abdomen. We obtained acoustic transfer characteristics across the human audio range and pressure maps in transverse planes passing through the uterus at 5 kHz, 10 kHz and 20 kHz, showcasing multiple scattering and modal patterns. Our calculations suggest that for all datasets, the sound transmitted in utero is attenuated by as little as 6 dB below 1 kHz, confirming results from animal studies that the maternal abdomen and pelvis do not shelter the fetus from external noise.

Surgical video workflow analysis has made intensive development in computer-assisted surgery by combining deep learning models, aiming to enhance surgical scene analysis and decision-making. However, previous research has mainly focused on identifying coarse-grained surgical phases from surgical videos. In order to provide a more comprehensive fine-grained analysis of surgical videos, this work focuses on accurately identifying triplets &amp;lt;instrument, verb, target&amp;gt; from surgical videos. Specifically, we propose a vision-language deep learning framework that incorporates intra- and inter- triplet modeling, termed I2TM, to explore the relationships among triplets and leverage the model understanding of the entire surgical process, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of recognition. Besides, we also develop a new surgical triplet semantic enhancer (TSE) to establish semantic relationships, both intra- and inter-triplets, across visual and textual modalities. Extensive experimental results on surgical video benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can capture finer semantics, achieve effective surgical video understanding and analysis, with potential for widespread medical applications.

# Evolution algorithm with adaptive genetic operator and dynamic scoring mechanism for large-scale sparse many-objective optimization

## 基于自适应遗传算子和动态评分机制的大规模稀疏多目标优化进化算法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5120828/latest

Large-scale sparse multi-objective optimization problems are prevalent in numerous real-world scenarios, such as neural network training, sparse regression, pattern mining and critical node detection, where Pareto optimal solutions exhibit sparse characteristics. The extensive number of decision variables and sparsity requirements make the optimization algorithms face more challenges. To address these issues more effectively, this paper proposes an evolution algorithm with the adaptive genetic operator and dynamic scoring mechanism for large-scale sparse many-objective optimization (SparseEA-AGDS). Within the evolutionary algorithm for large-scale Sparse (SparseEA) framework, the proposed adaptive genetic operator and dynamic scoring mechanism adaptively adjust the probability of cross-mutation operations based on the fluctuating non-dominated layer levels of individuals, concurrently updating the scores of decision variables to encourage superior individuals to gain additional genetic opportunities. Moreover, to augment the algorithm's capability to handle many-objective problems, a reference point-based environmental selection strategy is incorporated. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that the SparseEA-AGDS algorithm outperforms five other algorithms in terms of convergence and diversity on the SMOP benchmark problem set with many-objective and also yields superior sparse Pareto optimal solutions.

Quantum machine learning is among the most exciting potential applications of quantum computing. However, the vulnerability of quantum information to environmental noises and the consequent high cost for realizing fault tolerance has impeded the quantum models from learning complex datasets. Here, we introduce Adaboost.Q, a quantum adaptation of the classical adaptive boosting (Adaboost) algorithm designed to enhance learning capabilities of quantum classifiers. Based on the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement, the algorithm improves the prediction accuracy by refining the attention mechanism during the adaptive training and combination of quantum classifiers. We experimentally demonstrate the versatility of our approach on a programmable superconducting processor, where we observe notable performance enhancements across various quantum machine learning models, including quantum neural networks and quantum convolutional neural networks. With Adaboost.Q, we achieve an accuracy above 86% for a ten-class classification task over 10,000 test samples, and an accuracy of 100% for a quantum feature recognition task over 1,564 test samples. Our results demonstrate a foundational tool for advancing quantum machine learning towards practical applications, which has broad applicability to both the current noisy and the future fault-tolerant quantum devices.

Artificial intelligences are indispensable social infrastructures, neural networks are embodiment methodologies, and neuromorphic systems are promising solutions for compact size and low energy. Memristors were first prepared for the synapse devices but incur energy consumption, and memcapacitors were next prepared but have small dynamic ranges of capacitance. In this research, we have developed a neuromorphic system using capacitor synapses. Here, multiple capacitors have binary-weighted capacitances and are controlled to be connected to intermediate signals. They are discharged through transistors, and when they fall below the threshold voltage, the output signals are inverted. After all, electric charges in the multiple capacitances are summed and measured by the inverting intervals, which is the same as multiply&ndash;accumulate operation. A large-scale integration chip is actually fabricated. The working is confirmed by MNIST, and the circuit-aware rounding improves the accuracy to 96 %, indicating a sufficient possibility for practical applications, and the energy efficiency is 163 GOPS/W even by the 180 nm technology, indicating a great potential for low energy consumption.

# A Synergistic Approach for Enhanced Eye Blink Detection using Wavelet Analysis, Autoencoding and Crow-Search Optimized k-NN Algorithm

## 使用小波分析，自动编码和乌鸦搜索优化的k-nn算法增强眨眼检测的协同方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5297390/latest

This research endeavour introduces a state-of-the-art, assimilated approach for eye blink detection from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. It combines the prominent strategies of wavelet analysis, autoencoding, and a Crow-Search-optimized k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to enhance the performance of eye blink detection from EEG signals. This procedure is initiated by escalating the robustness of EEG data through jittering, which integrates noise into the dataset. Consequently, the wavelet transform is highly demanded during feature extraction in identifying the essential time-frequency components of the signals.&nbsp; These features are further distilled using an autoencoder to provide a dense, yet informative representation. Prior to introducing these features into the machine learning system, they were adjusted. Evidently, the hyperparameters of the k-Nearest Neighbors model have been fine-tuned using Crow Search Algorithm, inspired by the hunting characteristics of crows. This optimization method actively samples the search space to balance exploration and exploitation to identify the optimal configuration for the model. The k-NN model that has been optimized using the proposed method demonstrates significantly higher performance in the eye blink detection process in comparison to the deep learning models when equipped with decorous feature extraction and fine tuning. The effectiveness of the developed system has been ascertained according to the assessment indices such as accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrix. Thus, the present work offers an optimal method of detecting the eye blink from the EEG signals assisting in the development of further EEG applications including user interfaces, fatigue level identification, and neurological disorders analysis through the enhancement of signal processing and optimization methods. It becomes evident after a detailed evaluation that conventional machine learning algorithms if implemented with correct feature extraction and fine-tuning surpass the deep learning approaches including the frameworks composed of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and empirical mode decomposition by approximately 96% across all datasets. This proves the advantage of optimized traditional Machine Learning models over the Deep Learning models in realistic EEG-based eye blink detection.

# Low-Rank Optimization for Efficient Compression of CNN Models

## CNN模型高效压缩的低秩优化算法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5388638/latest

Tensor decomposition is an important method for compressing convolutional neural network (CNN) models. However, in the decomposition process, it is necessary to configure appropriate rank parameters for each convolutional kernel tensor. To address the difficulty in setting ranks, we propose a low-rank optimization algorithm based on information entropy. By solving the optimization problems, this algorithm can automatically learn the low-rank structure and rank parameters of convolutional kernel tensors, achieving global automatic configuration while ensuring model accuracy. Moreover, we design a weight generator for the network after tensor decomposition, which dynamically assesses the importance of filters of low-dimensional convolutional kernel tensors on a global scale. Indeed, pruning in the low-dimensional space can further enhance compression effects with minimal loss in accuracy. By testing various CNN models on different datasets, the results show that the proposed low-rank optimization algorithm can obtain all rank parameters in a single training process, and the average accuracy loss of the decomposed model does not exceed 1%. Meanwhile, the pruning method in low-dimensional space can achieve a compression ratio of over 4.7&amp;times; with an accuracy loss of less than 1.3%.

Heterogeneous graph representation learning has attracted considerable interest for its effectiveness in capturing the structural information of nodes within complex and diverse networks. However, existing heterogeneous graph representation learning models primarily focus on structural embeddings, overlooking the importance of node attributes and temporal information in understanding complex interaction networks, particularly in e-commerce heterogeneous networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Attribute-enhanced Multi-Interaction Representation Learning method in e-commerce heterogeneous information networks, namely AMIRLe. Specifically, AMIRLe first processes high-dimensional data and identifies hidden patterns via tensor decomposition techniques to construct multi-interaction heterogeneous networks. Then, a novel time-aware attribute embedding method is proposed, which employs an attention mechanism to enhance key node aggregation after integrating interaction time information as auxiliary attributes with node attributes. Finally, a graph neural network (GNN) method is designed to integrate meta-path-based structure embeddings with attribute embeddings to produce the final embeddings. Link prediction experiments on three real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate that performance of AMIRLe superior to state-of-the-art methods.
