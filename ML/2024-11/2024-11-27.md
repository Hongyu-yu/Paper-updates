# Data-driven Modeling of Granular Chains with Modern Koopman Theory

## 基于现代Koopman理论的颗粒链数据驱动建模

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15142

arXiv:2411.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Externally driven dense packings of particles can exhibit nonlinear wave phenomena that are not described by effective medium theory or linearized approximate models. Such nontrivial wave responses can be exploited to design sound-focusing/scrambling devices, acoustic filters, and analog computational units. At high amplitude vibrations or low confinement pressures, the effect of nonlinear particle contacts becomes increasingly noticeable, and the interplay of nonlinearity, disorder, and discreteness in the system gives rise to remarkable properties, particularly useful in designing structures with exotic properties. In this paper, we build upon the data-driven methods in dynamical system analysis and show that the Koopman spectral theory can be applied to granular crystals, enabling their phase space analysis beyond the linearizable regime and without recourse to any approximations considered in the previous works. We show that a deep neural network can map the dynamics to a latent space where the essential nonlinearity of the granular system unfolds into a high-dimensional linear space. As a proof of concept, we use data from numerical simulations of a two-particle system and evaluate the accuracy of the trajectory predictions under various initial conditions. By incorporating data from experimental measurements, our proposed framework can directly capture the underlying dynamics without imposing any assumptions about the physics model. Spectral analysis of the trained surrogate system can help bridge the gap between the simulation results and the physical realization of granular crystals and facilitate the inverse design of materials with desired behaviors.

# Accelerating CALPHAD-based Phase Diagram Predictions in Complex Alloys Using Universal Machine Learning Potentials: Opportunities and Challenges

## 使用通用机器学习潜力加速复杂合金中基于calphed的相图预测: 机遇与挑战

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15351

arXiv:2411.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate phase diagram prediction is crucial for understanding alloy thermodynamics and advancing materials design. While traditional CALPHAD methods are robust, they are resource-intensive and limited by experimentally assessed data. This work explores the use of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) such as M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, and ORB to significantly accelerate phase diagram calculations by using the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) to map calculations of the energies and free energies of atomistic systems to CALPHAD-compatible thermodynamic descriptions. Using case studies including Cr-Mo, Cu-Au, and Pt-W, we demonstrate that MLIPs, particularly ORB, achieve computational speedups exceeding three orders of magnitude compared to DFT while maintaining phase stability predictions within acceptable accuracy. Extending this approach to liquid phases and ternary systems like Cr-Mo-V highlights its versatility for high-entropy alloys and complex chemical spaces. This work demonstrates that MLIPs, integrated with tools like ATAT within a CALPHAD framework, provide an efficient and accurate framework for high-throughput thermodynamic modeling, enabling rapid exploration of novel alloy systems. While many challenges remain to be addressed, the accuracy of some of these MLIPs (ORB in particular) are on the verge of paving the way toward high-throughput generation of CALPHAD thermodynamic descriptions of multi-component, multi-phase alloy systems.

# Graph Transformer Networks for Accurate Band Structure Prediction: An End-to-End Approach

## 用于精确频带结构预测的图变压器网络: 端到端方法

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16483

arXiv:2411.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting electronic band structures from crystal structures is crucial for understanding structure-property correlations in materials science. First-principles approaches are accurate but computationally intensive. Recent years, machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to this field, while existing ML models predominantly focus on band gap predictions or indirect band structure estimation via solving predicted Hamiltonians. An end-to-end model to predict band structure accurately and efficiently is still lacking. Here, we introduce a graph Transformer-based end-to-end approach that directly predicts band structures from crystal structures with high accuracy. Our method leverages the continuity of the k-path and treat continuous bands as a sequence. We demonstrate that our model not only provides accurate band structure predictions but also can derive other properties (such as band gap, band center, and band dispersion) with high accuracy. We verify the model performance on large and diverse datasets.

Beyond team results, we discuss the hackathon event and its hybrid format, which included physical hubs in Toronto, Montreal, San Francisco, Berlin, Lausanne, and Tokyo, alongside a global online hub to enable local and virtual collaboration. Overall, the event highlighted significant improvements in LLM capabilities since the previous year's hackathon, suggesting continued expansion of LLMs for applications in materials science and chemistry research. These outcomes demonstrate the dual utility of LLMs as both multipurpose models for diverse machine learning tasks and platforms for rapid prototyping custom applications in scientific research.

# Proportional infinite-width infinite-depth limit for deep linear neural networks

## 深度线性神经网络的比例无限宽无限深极限

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15267

arXiv:2411.15267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distributional properties of linear neural networks with random parameters in the context of large networks, where the number of layers diverges in proportion to the number of neurons per layer. Prior works have shown that in the infinite-width regime, where the number of neurons per layer grows to infinity while the depth remains fixed, neural networks converge to a Gaussian process, known as the Neural Network Gaussian Process. However, this Gaussian limit sacrifices descriptive power, as it lacks the ability to learn dependent features and produce output correlations that reflect observed labels. Motivated by these limitations, we explore the joint proportional limit in which both depth and width diverge but maintain a constant ratio, yielding a non-Gaussian distribution that retains correlations between outputs. Our contribution extends previous works by rigorously characterizing, for linear activation functions, the limiting distribution as a nontrivial mixture of Gaussians.

# Machine learning for cerebral blood vessels' malformations

## 机器学习在脑血管畸形中的应用

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16349

arXiv:2411.16349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations are life-threatening hemodynamic pathologies of the brain. While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 %. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.

# Global and local synchrony of coupled neurons in small-world networks

## 小世界网络中耦合神经元的全局和局部同步

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16374

arXiv:2411.16374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronous firing of neurons is thought to play important functional roles such as feature binding and switching of cognitive states. Although synchronization has mainly been investigated using model neurons with simple connection topology so far, real neural networks have more complex structures. Here we examine behavior of pulse-coupled leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with various network structures. We first show that the dispersion of the number of connections for neurons influences dynamical behavior even if other major topological statistics are kept fixed. The rewiring probability parameter representing the randomness of networks bridges two spatially opposite frameworks: precise local synchrony and rough global synchrony. Finally, cooperation of the global connections and the local clustering property, which is prominent in small-world networks, reinforces synchrony of distant neuronal groups receiving coherent inputs.

# Why hyperdensity functionals describe any equilibrium observable

## 为什么超密度泛函描述任何可观察的平衡

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10534

arXiv:2410.10534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recent hyperdensity functional theory for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of soft matter systems [F. Samm\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024); 10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.098201]. Hyperdensity functionals give access to the behaviour of arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium many-body systems. The approach is based on classical density functional theory applied to an extended ensemble using standard functional techniques. The associated formally exact generalized Mermin-Evans functional relationships can be represented accurately by neural functionals. These neural networks are trained via simulation-based supervised machine learning and they allow one to carry out efficient functional calculus using automatic differentiation and numerical functional line integration. Exact sum rules, including hard wall contact theorems and hyperfluctuation Ornstein-Zernike equations, interrelate the different correlation functions. We lay out close connections to hyperforce correlation sum rules [S. Robitschko et al., Commun. Phys. 7, 103 (2024); 10.1038/s42005-024-01568-y] that arise from statistical mechanical gauge invariance [J. M\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 217101 (2024); 10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.217101]. Further quantitative measures of collective self-organization are provided by hyperdirect correlation functionals and spatially resolved hyperfluctuation profiles. The theory facilitates to gain deep insight into the inherent structuring mechanisms that govern the behaviour of both simple and complex order parameters in coupled many-body systems.

# Finite Volume Physical Informed Neural Network (FV-PINN) with Reduced Derivative Order for Incompressible Flows

## 具有不可压缩流的导数阶的有限体积物理通知神经网络 (fv-pinn)

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17095

arXiv:2411.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) has evolved into a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations, which has been applied to various fields such as energy, environment, en-gineering, etc. When utilizing PINN to solve partial differential equations, it is common to rely on Automatic Differentiation (AD) to compute the residuals of the governing equations. This can lead to certain precision losses, thus affecting the accuracy of the network prediction. This paper pro-poses a Finite Volume Physics-Informed Neural Network (FV-PINN), designed to address steady-state problems of incompressible flow. This method divides the solution domain into mul-tiple grids. Instead of calculating the residuals of the Navier-Stokes equations at collocation points within the grid, as is common in traditional PINNs, this approach evaluates them at Gaussian in-tegral points on the grid boundaries using Gauss's theorem. The loss function is constructed using the Gaussian integral method, and the differentiation order for velocity is reduced. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, we predict the velocity and pressure fields for two typical examples in fluid topology optimization. The results are compared with commercial software COMSOL, which indicates that FVI-PINN significantly improves the prediction accuracy of both the velocity and pressure fields while accelerating the training speed of the network.

arXiv:2411.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel methodology that integrates singular value decomposition (SVD) with a shallow linear neural network for forecasting high resolution fluid mechanics data. The method, termed LC-SVD-DLinear, combines a low-cost variant of singular value decomposition (LC-SVD) with the DLinear architecture, which decomposes the input features-specifically, the temporal coefficients-into trend and seasonality components, enabling a shallow neural network to capture the non-linear dynamics of the temporal data. This methodology uses under-resolved data, which can either be input directly into the hybrid model or downsampled from high resolution using two distinct techniques provided by the methodology. Working with under-resolved cases helps reduce the overall computational cost. Additionally, we present a variant of the method, LC-HOSVD-DLinear, which combines a low-cost version of the high-order singular value decomposition (LC-HOSVD) algorithm with the DLinear network, designed for high-order data. These approaches have been validated using two datasets: first, a numerical simulation of three-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at $Re = 220$; and second, an experimental dataset of turbulent flow passing a circular cylinder at $Re = 2600$. The combination of these datasets demonstrates the robustness of the method. The forecasting and reconstruction results are evaluated through various error metrics, including uncertainty quantification. The work developed in this article will be included in the next release of ModelFLOWs-app

Abstract: Accurate characterization of radiation pulse profiles is crucial for optimizing beam quality and enhancing experimental outcomes in Free Electron Laser (FEL) research. In this paper, we present a novel approach that employs machine learning techniques for real-time virtual diagnostics of FEL radiation pulses. Our advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic tool utilizes longitudinal phase space data obtained from the X-band transverse deflecting structure to reconstruct the temporal profile of FEL pulses in real time. Unlike traditional single-shot methods, this AI-driven solution provides a non-invasive, highly efficient alternative for pulse characterization. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models, our method facilitates precise single-shot measurements of FEL pulse power, offering significant advantages for FEL science research. This work outlines the conceptual framework, methodology, and validation results of our virtual diagnostic tool, demonstrating its potential to significantly impact FEL research.

# Maximizing the Impact of Deep Learning on Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Climate Forecasting: The Essential Role of Optimization

## 最大化深度学习对亚季节到季节气候预测的影响: 优化的重要作用

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16728

arXiv:2411.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather and climate forecasting is vital for sectors such as agriculture and disaster management. Although numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems have advanced, forecasting at the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) scale, spanning 2 to 6 weeks, remains challenging due to the chaotic and sparse atmospheric signals at this interval. Even state-of-the-art deep learning models struggle to outperform simple climatology models in this domain. This paper identifies that optimization, instead of network structure, could be the root cause of this performance gap, and then we develop a novel multi-stage optimization strategy to close the gap. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that our multi-stage optimization approach significantly improves key skill metrics, PCC and TCC, while utilizing the same backbone structure, surpassing the state-of-the-art NWP systems (ECMWF-S2S) by over \textbf{19-91\%}. Our research contests the recent study that direct forecasting outperforms rolling forecasting for S2S tasks. Through theoretical analysis, we propose that the underperformance of rolling forecasting may arise from the accumulation of Jacobian matrix products during training. Our multi-stage framework can be viewed as a form of teacher forcing to address this issue. Code is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Baguan-S2S-23E7/}

# Enhancing Fluorescence Lifetime Parameter Estimation Accuracy with Differential Transformer Based Deep Learning Model Incorporating Pixelwise Instrument Response Function

## 结合逐像素仪器响应函数的基于差分变压器的深度学习模型提高荧光寿命参数估计精度

arXiv:2411.16896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is an important molecular imaging modality that can provide unique information for biomedical applications. FLI is based on acquiring and processing photon time of arrival histograms. The shape and temporal offset of these histograms depends on many factors, such as the instrument response function (IRF), optical properties, and the topographic profile of the sample. Several inverse solver analytical methods have been developed to compute the underlying fluorescence lifetime parameters, but most of them are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Thus, deep learning (DL) algorithms have progressively replaced computation methods in fluorescence lifetime parameter estimation. Often, DL models are trained with simple datasets either generated through simulation or a simple experiment where the fluorophore surface profile is mostly flat; therefore, DL models often do not perform well on samples with complex surface profiles such as ex-vivo organs or in-vivo whole intact animals. Herein, we introduce a new DL architecture using state-of-the-art Differential Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, MFliNet (Macroscopic FLI Network), that takes an additional input of IRF together with TPSF, addressing discrepancies in the photon time-of-arrival distribution. We demonstrate the model's performance through carefully designed, complex tissue-mimicking phantoms and preclinical in-vivo cancer xenograft experiments.

Abstract: Whether in fundamental physics, cybersecurity or finance, the detection of anomalies with machine learning techniques is a highly relevant and active field of research, as it potentially accelerates the discovery of novel physics or criminal activities. We provide a systematic analysis of the generalization properties of the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) algorithm, using projected quantum kernels for a realistic dataset of the latter application. These results were both theoretically simulated and experimentally validated on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors, by leveraging partial state tomography to obtain precise approximations of the quantum states that are used to estimate the quantum kernels. Moreover, we analyzed both platforms respective hardware-efficient feature maps over a wide range of anomaly ratios and showed that for our financial dataset in all anomaly regimes, the quantum-enhanced OCSVMs lead to better generalization properties compared to the purely classical approach. As such our work bridges the gap between theory and practice in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era and paves the path towards useful quantum applications.

# A generalised novel loss function for computational fluid dynamics

## 用于计算流体动力学的广义新型损失函数

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17059

arXiv:2411.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are crucial in automotive, aerospace, maritime and medical applications, but are limited by the complexity, cost and computational requirements of directly calculating the flow, often taking days of compute time. Machine-learning architectures, such as controlled generative adversarial networks (cGANs) hold significant potential in enhancing or replacing CFD investigations, due to cGANs ability to approximate the underlying data distribution of a dataset. Unlike traditional cGAN applications, where the entire image carries information, CFD data contains small regions of highly variant data, immersed in a large context of low variance that is of minimal importance. This renders most existing deep learning techniques that give equal importance to every portion of the data during training, inefficient. To mitigate this, a novel loss function is proposed called Gradient Mean Squared Error (GMSE) which automatically and dynamically identifies the regions of importance on a field-by-field basis, assigning appropriate weights according to the local variance. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution, three identical networks were trained; optimised with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, proposed GMSE loss and a dynamic variant of GMSE (DGMSE). The novel loss function resulted in faster loss convergence, correlating to reduced training time, whilst also displaying an 83.6% reduction in structural similarity error between the generated field and ground truth simulations, a 76.6% higher maximum rate of loss and an increased ability to fool a discriminator network. It is hoped that this loss function will enable accelerated machine learning within computational fluid dynamics.

Abstract: The proximity perception of objects in granular materials is significant, especially for applications like minesweeping. However, due to particles' opacity and complex properties, existing proximity sensors suffer from high costs from sophisticated hardware and high user-cost from unintuitive results. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective proximity sensing system for underground stuff based on the haptic feedback of the sensor-granules interaction. We study and employ the unique characteristic of particles -- failure wedge zone, and combine the machine learning method -- Gaussian process regression, to identify the force signal changes induced by the proximity of objects, so as to achieve near-field perception. Furthermore, we design a novel trajectory to control the probe searching in granules for a wide range of perception. Also, our proximity sensing system can adaptively determine optimal parameters for robustness operation in different particles. Experiments demonstrate our system can perceive underground objects over 0.5 to 7 cm in advance among various materials.

# X-MeshGraphNet: Scalable Multi-Scale Graph Neural Networks for Physics Simulation

## X-meshgraphnet: 用于物理仿真的可扩展多尺度图神经网络

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17164

arXiv:2411.17164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant traction for simulating complex physical systems, with models like MeshGraphNet demonstrating strong performance on unstructured simulation meshes. However, these models face several limitations, including scalability issues, requirement for meshing at inference, and challenges in handling long-range interactions. In this work, we introduce X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable, multi-scale extension of MeshGraphNet designed to address these challenges.
  X-MeshGraphNet overcomes the scalability bottleneck by partitioning large graphs and incorporating halo regions that enable seamless message passing across partitions. This, combined with gradient aggregation, ensures that training across partitions is equivalent to processing the entire graph at once. To remove the dependency on simulation meshes, X-MeshGraphNet constructs custom graphs directly from CAD files by generating uniform point clouds on the surface or volume of the object and connecting k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, our model builds multi-scale graphs by iteratively combining coarse and fine-resolution point clouds, where each level refines the previous, allowing for efficient long-range interactions.
  Our experiments demonstrate that X-MeshGraphNet maintains the predictive accuracy of full-graph GNNs while significantly improving scalability and flexibility. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming mesh generation at inference, offering a practical solution for real-time simulation across a wide range of applications. The code for reproducing the results presented in this paper is available through NVIDIA Modulus: github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main/examples/cfd/xaeronet.

# A Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations

## 用于分子动力学的神经网络潜力生成器: 通过主动学习为纳秒级模拟构建强大而准确的潜力

arXiv:2411.17191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.

Direct implementation of three-qubit gates simplifies the design of quantum circuits, thereby being conducive to performing complex quantum algorithms. Here, we propose and present an experimental demonstration of a quantum Toffoli gate fully exploiting the polarization and orbital angular momentum of a single photon. The Toffoli gate is implemented using the polarized diffractive neural networks scheme, achieving a mean truth table visibility of $97.27\pm0.20\%$. We characterize the gate's performance through quantum state tomography on 216 different input states and quantum process tomography, which yields a process fidelity of $94.05\pm 0.02\%$. Our method offers a novel approach for realizing the Toffoli gate without requiring exponential optical elements while maintaining extensibility to the implementation of other three-qubit gates.

# Quantifying information stored in synaptic connections rather than in firing patterns of neural networks

## 量化存储在突触连接而不是神经网络激发模式中的信息

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17692

arXiv:2411.17692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of our understanding of both biological and artificial neural networks is that they store information in the strengths of connections among the constituent neurons. However, in contrast to the well-established theory for quantifying information encoded by the firing patterns of neural networks, little is known about quantifying information encoded by its synaptic connections. Here, we develop a theoretical framework using continuous Hopfield networks as an exemplar for associative neural networks, and data that follow mixtures of broadly applicable multivariate log-normal distributions. Specifically, we analytically derive the Shannon mutual information between the data and singletons, pairs, triplets, quadruplets, and arbitrary n-tuples of synaptic connections within the network. Our framework corroborates well-established insights about storage capacity of, and distributed coding by, neural firing patterns. Strikingly, it discovers synergistic interactions among synapses, revealing that the information encoded jointly by all the synapses exceeds the 'sum of its parts'. Taken together, this study introduces an interpretable framework for quantitatively understanding information storage in neural networks, one that illustrates the duality of synaptic connectivity and neural population activity in learning and memory.

arXiv:2406.03563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern E(3)-Equivariant networks may be used to predict rotationally equivariant properties, including tensorial quantities. Three such quantities: the dielectric, piezoelectric, and elasticity tensors, are computationally expensive to produce ab initio for crystalline systems; however, with greater availability of such data in large material property databases, we now have a sufficient target space to begin training equivariant models in the prediction of such properties. Here we explicitly develop spherical harmonic decompositions of these tensorial properties using their general symmetries. We then apply three distinct E(3)-equivariant convolutional structures to the prediction of the components of these decompositions, allowing us to predict the aforementioned tensorial quantities in an equivariant manner and compare performance. We further report results testing the transferability of these predictive models between different tensorial target sets.

# Neural refractive index field: Unlocking the Potential of Background-oriented Schlieren Tomography in Volumetric Flow Visualization

arXiv:2409.14722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background-oriented Schlieren tomography (BOST) is a prevalent method for visualizing intricate turbulent flows, valued for its ease of implementation and capacity to capture three-dimensional distributions of a multitude of flow parameters. However, the voxel-based meshing scheme leads to significant challenges, such as inadequate spatial resolution, substantial discretization errors, poor noise immunity, and excessive computational costs. This work presents an innovative reconstruction approach termed neural refractive index field (NeRIF) which implicitly represents the flow field with a neural network, which is trained with tailored strategies. Both numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations on turbulent Bunsen flames suggest that our approach can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution while concurrently reducing computational expenses. Although showcased in the context of background-oriented schlieren tomography here, the key idea embedded in the NeRIF can be readily adapted to various other tomographic modalities including tomographic absorption spectroscopy and tomographic particle imaging velocimetry, broadening its potential impact across different domains of flow visualization and analysis.

# Uncertainty Propagation within Chained Models for Machine Learning Reconstruction of Neutrino-LAr Interactions

## 用于中微子-LAr相互作用的机器学习重建的链式模型内的不确定性传播

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09864

arXiv:2411.09864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential or chained models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning for scientific applications, due to their flexibility and ease of development. Chained models are particularly useful when a task is separable into distinct steps with a hierarchy of meaningful intermediate representations. In reliability-critical tasks, it is important to quantify the confidence of model inferences. However, chained models pose an additional challenge for uncertainty quantification, especially when input uncertainties need to be propagated. In such cases, a fully uncertainty-aware chain of models is required, where each step accepts a probability distribution over the input space, and produces a probability distribution over the output space. In this work, we present a case study for adapting a single model within an existing chain, designed for reconstruction within neutrino-Argon interactions, developed for neutrino oscillation experiments such as MicroBooNE, ICARUS, and the future DUNE experiment. We test the performance of an input uncertainty-enabled model against an uncertainty-blinded model using a method for generating synthetic noise. By comparing these two, we assess the increase in inference quality achieved by exposing models to upstream uncertainty estimates.

# Realization of High-Fidelity CZ Gate based on a Double-Transmon Coupler

## 基于双传输耦合器的高保真CZ门的实现

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18926

arXiv:2402.18926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Striving for higher gate fidelity is crucial not only for enhancing existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices but also for unleashing the potential of fault-tolerant quantum computation through quantum error correction. A recently proposed theoretical scheme, the double-transmon coupler (DTC), aims to achieve both suppressed residual interaction and a fast high-fidelity two-qubit gate simultaneously, particularly for highly detuned qubits. Harnessing the state-of-the-art fabrication techniques and a model-free pulse-optimization process based on reinforcement learning, we translate the theoretical DTC scheme into reality, attaining fidelities of 99.90% for a CZ gate and 99.98% for single-qubit gates. The performance of the DTC scheme demonstrates its potential as a competitive building block for superconducting quantum processors.

# Deep Supramolecular Language Processing for Co-crystal Prediction

## 用于共晶预测的深度超分子语言处理

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-vgvhk-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Approximately 40% of marketed drugs exhibit suboptimal pharmacokinetic profiles. Co-crystallization, where pairs of molecules form a multicomponent crystal, constitutes a promising strategy to enhance physicochemical properties without compromising the pharmacological activity.  However, finding promising co-crystal pairs is resource-intensive, due to the vast number of possible combinations. We present DeepCocrystal, a novel deep learning approach designed to predict co-crystal formation by processing the 'chemical language' from a supramolecular vantage point. Rigorous validation of DeepCocrystal showed a balanced accuracy of 78% in realistic scenarios, outperforming existing models. By leveraging properties of molecular string representations, DeepCocrystal can also estimate the uncertainty of its predictions. We harness this capability in a challenging prospective study, and successfully discovered two novel co-crystal of diflunisal, an anti-inflammatory drug. This study underscores the potential of deep learning - and in particular of chemical language processing - to accelerate co-crystallization, and ultimately drug development, in both academic and industrial contexts.

# Accurate Lattice Free Energies of Packing Polymorphs from Probabilistic Generative Models

## 来自概率生成模型的堆积多晶型物的精确晶格自由能

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-1lm95-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Finite-temperature lattice free energy differences between polymorphs of molecular crystals are fundamental to understanding and predicting the relative stability relationships underpinning polymorphism, yet are computationally expensive to obtain. Here, we implement and critically assess machine-learning-enabled targeted free energy calculations derived from flow-based generative models to compute the free energy difference between two ice crystal polymorphs (Ice XI and Ic), modelled with a fully flexible empirical classical force field. We demonstrate that even when remapping from an analytical reference distribution, such methods enable a cost-effective and accurate calculation of free energy differences between disconnected metastable ensembles when trained on locally ergodic data sampled exclusively from the ensembles of interest. Unlike classical free energy perturbation methods, such as the Einstein crystal method, the targeted approach analysed in this work requires no additional sampling of intermediate perturbed Hamiltonians, offering significant computational savings in the system sizes compared in this work. To systematically assess the accuracy of the method, we monitored the convergence of free energy estimates during training by implementing an overfitting-aware weighted averaging strategy. By comparing our results with ground-truth free energy differences computed with the Einstein crystal method, we assess the accuracy and efficiency of two different model architectures, employing two different representations of the supercells degrees of freedom (Cartesian vs. quaternion-based). We conduct our assessment by comparing free energy differences between crystal supercells of different sizes and temperatures and assessing the accuracy in extrapolating lattice free energies to the thermodynamic limit. While at low temperatures and in small system sizes, the models perform with similar accuracy, we note that for larger systems and high temperatures, the choice of representation is key to obtaining generalisable results of quality comparable to that obtained from the Einstein crystal method. We hope the current work to be a useful stepping stone towards efficient free energy calculations in larger, more conformationally flexible systems.

# Acceleration with Interpretability: Surrogate Model Based Collective Variable for Enhanced Sampling

## 具有可解释性的加速: 基于替代模型的增强采样的集体变量

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-x00x1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Most enhanced sampling methods facilitate the exploration of molecular free energy landscapes by applying a bias potential along a reduced dimensional collective variable (CV) space. The success of these methods depends on the ability of the CVs to follow the relevant slow modes of the system. Intuitive CVs, such as distances or contacts, often prove inadequate, particularly in biological systems involving many coupled degrees of freedom. Machine learning algorithms, especially neural networks (NN), can automate the process of CV discovery by combining a large number of molecular descriptors and often outperform intuitive CVs in sampling efficiency. However, their lack of interpretability and high cost of evaluation during trajectory propagation make NN-CVs difficult to apply to large biomolecular processes. Here, we introduce a surrogate model approach using lasso regression to express the output of a neural network as a linear combination of an automatically chosen subset of the input descriptors. We demonstrate successful applications of our surrogate model CVs in the enhanced sampling simulation of the conformational landscape of alanine dipeptide and chignolin mini-protein. In addition to providing mechanistic insights due to their explainable nature, the surrogate model CVs showed a negligible loss in efficiency and accuracy, compared to the NN-CVs, in reconstructing the underlying free energy surface. Moreover, due to their simplified functional forms, these CVs are better at extrapolating to unseen regions of the conformational space, e.g., saddle points. Surrogate model CVs are also less expensive to evaluate compared to their NN counterparts, making them suitable for enhanced sampling simulation of large and complex biomolecular processes.

# Predicting the Strength of Composites with Computer Vision Using Small Experimental Datasets

## 使用小型实验数据集通过计算机视觉预测复合材料的强度

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-sjdm7?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Composite materials offer versatile properties readily tailored to diverse applications, yet predicting their mechanical behavior remains challenging due to the complex interplay between morphology and performance. Here, we address these challenges by leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze X-ray computed tomography (CT) images of cold-sintered polymer-ceramic composites for correlation with mechanical performance. Morphological features as inputs for traditional machine learning models yielded limited predictive accuracy. Application of transfer learning from pretrained CNNs improved prediction accuracy. The model was refined with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and ensemble learning techniques to achieve R<sup>2</sup> values of up to 0.94 on unseen data. Additionally, we utilized the Z-stack nature of X-ray CT imaging -- where multiple 2D slices from a 3D dataset provide additional insights -- to apply a meta-learning approach for final predictions. This method enabled the prediction of intrinsic 3D properties from 2D slices that improved R<sup>2</sup> values to 0.95. This work demonstrates alternative approaches with machine learning using small datasets to uncover morphology-structure-property relationships in composites and highlights the potential of computer vision in property predictions for materials development.

As a typical representative of a high-stress occupational group, university researchers are exposed to significant risks associated with &amp;lsquo;excessive workload&amp;rsquo;. Continuous engagement in intense mental labor leads to the accumulation of physical and mental fatigue, which ultimately increases the susceptibility to cardiovascular and heart diseases. Identifying and monitoring sensitive physiological indicators associated with &amp;lsquo;excessive workload&amp;rsquo; is considered an effective strategy to reduce the risks. In this study, an experiment was conducted to build a dataset for researchers using a selection of physiologically sensitive indicators. The dataset including photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, facial behavioral attributes and head posture feature parameters. Six deep learning models and three machine learning models were used in this study for analysis. The results show that all constructed models exhibit excellent performance. Notably, the PSO-CNN-LSTM and MFO-CNN-BiLSTM models show unrivalled accuracy and robustness in the classification task, with prediction accuracies of 99.62% and 99.76%. Respectively, along with a stable AUC value of over 0.99. This highlights their ability to accurately predict the risk of &amp;lsquo;excessive workload&amp;rsquo; related diseases in humans. This study provides new insights into the prevention and management of occupational diseases, enhancing occupational health management.

## ATP6V1C1和COPA: 自噬相关标志物，用于追踪从AKI到CKD的进展-多组学研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5321995/latest

This study explored the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), focusing on autophagy-related genes and their immune infiltration during the transition from AKI to CKD. We performed weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) using two microarray datasets (GSE139061 and GSE66494) in the GEO database, and identified autophagy signatures by KEGG, GO, and GSEA enrichment analysis. Machine learning algorithms such as LASSO, random forest and XGBoost were used to construct the diagnostic model, and the diagnostic performance of GSE30718 (AKI) and GSE37171 (CKD) was used as validation cohorts to evaluate its diagnostic performance. The study identified 14 autophagy candidate genes, among which ATP6V1C1 and COPA were identified as key biomarkers that were able to effectively distinguish between AKI and CKD. Immune cell infiltration and GSEA analysis revealed immune dysregulation in AKI, and these genes were associated with inflammation and immune pathways. Single-cell analysis showed that ATP6V1C1 and COPA were specifically expressed in AKI and CKD, which may be related to renal fibrosis. In addition, drug prediction and molecular docking analysis proposed SZ(+)-(S)-202-791 and PDE4 inhibitor 16 as potential therapeutic agents. In summary, this study provides new insights into the relationship between AKI and CKD and lays a foundation for the development of new treatment strategies.

# Divide-and-conquer strategy with engineered &ldquo;ossification center&rdquo; organoids for rapid bone healing via recruiting developmental cell community

## 分而治之的策略与工程化的 “骨化中心” 类器官通过招募发育细胞群落实现快速骨愈合

Current approaches for bone repair are often focused on local delivery of growth factors that are aimed at coupled angiogenesis and osteogenesis. However, delayed revascularization and regeneration of severe bone defects are still challenging. In this study, we engineered an ossification center-like organoid (OCO) that consist of inner-core bone morphogenetic and neurotrophic spheroid generated via MSCs-loaded 3D printing, alongside the interstitially distributed outer-shell proangiogenic neurotrophic phase. Our results demonstrate that collective &amp;nbsp;implantation of OCOs achieved rapid bone bridging with successive OC-like bone ossicles formation across the bone defect in a &ldquo;divide-and-conquer&rdquo; way. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis unveiled a developmentally mimicking stem cell community that dominated with Krt8+ skeletal stem cells (SSCs) was uniquely recruited by the pro-regenerative in-situ organoid fusion and maturation. Particularly noteworthy is the specific expansion of Krt8+ SSCs concomitant with the simultaneous reduction of Has1+ migratory fibroblasts (MFs) 2 weeks post-OCO implantation. Furthermore, cross-species comparisons employing machine learning revealed high resemblance of relative Krt8+ SSCs/Has1+ MFs composition in bone regeneration with that in public data from developmental bone tissues. Our findings advocate an approach akin to &ldquo;divide-and-conquer&rdquo; utilizing engineered OC-like organoids for prompt regeneration of large-sized bone defects.

In this paper, we investigate an Internet of Things (IoT)-based platform utilizing Electrooculography (EOG) to assist, control, and monitor a smart home environment in real-time for patients with motor disabilities. Users can interact with the intelligent environment through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offers predefined options for controlling doors, windows, lights, air conditioning, temperature, and TV functions. The proposed approach is based mainly on utilization of two transforms namely Stockwell (S-transform) and Wavelet transforms respectively for detection of abrupt changes EOG signals. Several signal statistical features including maximum, minimum, mean, median, Root Mean Square (RMS), standard deviation, Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Mean Curve length (MCL), kurtosis and skewness of the processed signals are utilized to characterize the EOG signals which have been applied for the classification stage to detect one of eye movement directions including: up, down, right, left, no movement or blinking. Two different wavelet families including Daubechies (db4) and Symlets (Sym4) wavelets are considered. The proposed approach was conducted on a data set which acquired by a custom device to measure and record EOG signals. Then, the decomposed horizontal and vertical signals are grouped into a vector to be the inserted as an input to the classification models. Finally, the data are classified using three types of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kernel Neural Network (KNN) and Ensemble Tree (ET) classifiers. The result of the proposed method outperforms the results of the other previous published methods when using different evaluation metrics. A high average accuracy of 97.7% is achieved from SVM using db4 which demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method

In today's digital age, social media platforms are key for information sharing, but they also facilitate the rapid spread of fake news, especially during events like the COVID-19 pandemic. A system has been developed to address this issue by categorizing news articles into six categories, from "true" to "pants on fire." Data is gathered from diverse sources like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and trusted organizations such as WHO and UNICEF. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and machine learning algorithms, including Bi-LSTM neural networks with attention mechanisms, help improve detection accuracy. Despite challenges with multi-class datasets, the system achieved 51% accuracy and a 44.9% F-score. The system also assesses the credibility of news sources and authors by evaluating social media activity and potential biases. Further improvements are sought to refine performance and expand across social media platforms.

Background The association between urban green spaces, especially street greenery, and physical activity (PA) in older adults is understudied. This study utilized Baidu Street View images and deep learning techniques to objectively assess street greenery exposure and its relationship with different types of PA among older adults in China.Methods This study investigated 1326 older adults (aged 60 or above) living in Beijing, China. Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) was used to assess the PA level of older adults. Baidu Street View images and deep learning were used to assess the level of street greenery in the 500-meter buffer zone around the community. The study employed ANOVA, Chi-square tests, and multilevel linear regression to analyze the data.Results After controlling for individual factors, household economic income, and other confounders, the multilevel linear regression model showed that street greenery was significantly and positively correlated with transportation PA (&beta;&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.08, P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.01). There was no significant correlation between street greenery and leisure PA, household PA (P&amp;gt;0.05).Conclusions The level of street greenery around the community is significantly associated with transportation PA among Chinese older adults. It is recommended that the planning of urban green spaces should focus on street greenery, add bicycle lanes and sidewalks, and provide safe and comfortable environments to motivate older adults to actively participate in PA.

# Performance Evaluation Model of Physical Exercises with a Robotic Trainer System

## 使用机器人教练系统进行体育锻炼的绩效评估模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5402527/latest

This paper presents the development of a model for performance evaluation of physical exercises with a robotic trainer system, with the specific aim of distinguishing between consistent &amp;amp; correct performance and non-consistent &amp;amp;/or incorrect performance by considering differences between repetitions. The performance evaluation is based on joint angles data extracted from the system's camera. The initial exploration of clustering for pattern recognition in an unlabeled dataset yielded insufficient performance, but it did highlight the importance of scaling features by exercise type as a means to distinguish between performance types. Following transitioning from unsupervised to supervised learning, classification by logistic regression models was evaluated, with different subsets of feature groups and scaling conditions. An evaluation of scaling conditions revealed their importance, particularly for training on a single dataset. Two datasets were acquired and analyzed, i.e., training of older adults (original dataset) and training with young adults (dedicated data set for evaluation). Training on the original dataset and the additional dedicated data set improved accuracy, suggesting a contribution from one dataset to the classification of the other. Logistic regression models, chosen for their simplicity and efficiency, provided explainable results, aligning with the operational capabilities of our robotic trainer. The selected performance evaluation model was able to classify between the performance types with an accuracy of 0.96 on the older adults data set and 0.97 on the other data set. Future research to enhance human-robot interaction should be aimed at exploring real-time evaluation models and implementing feedback based on this performance evaluation methodology.

Crop damage and monetary losses occur due to plant diseases. At specified periods, farmers closely monitor their crops in the field to look for infections or diseases. In place of manual diagnosis, computers have been used to provide computerized tracking and recognition of a variety of diseases.This study makes a contribution to denoising algorithms that improve contrast, edge details and picture details. To isolate the leaf affected area, segmentation was carried out. Image fusion is performed using the segmented image obtained from several segmentation techniques, and features are extracted according to structural, texture, and color criteria. Furthermore, an image fusion technique based on Discrete Shearlet Transforms (DST) is applied to improve imaging quality while reducing redundancy. The color, texture, and structural elements of the fused images are retrieved and fed into the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification, resulting in improved performance.

This study examines the relationship between Total Electron Content (TEC) anomalies in the ionosphere and seismic activity, with a particular focus on the Elazig (2020) and Maras (2023) earthquakes. An unsupervised machine learning approach, namely the Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm, was employed to analyze TEC data from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) stations situated in the regions affected by the seismic events. The analysis has been conducted over a two-month period, encompassing one month prior to and one month following each earthquake. A novel methodology is introduced, whereby TEC data from multiple stations is aggregated into virtual stations, with each station weighted according to its proximity to the earthquake epicenter. The findings reveal a distinctive pattern of TEC anomalies occurring especially 10&amp;ndash;15 days before both earthquakes, followed by a reduction in fluctuations as the seismic event approaches. It is noteworthy that significant anomaly synchronization is observed across all virtual stations, which lends support to the hypothesis that TEC variations may serve as a pre-seismic indicator.

# Research on the Construction Method of the MCNN-LSTM-SVM Fusion Model for Thermal Error of the Precision Boring Machine Feed Axis with Small Samples

## 小样本精密镗床进给轴热误差mcnn-lstm-svm融合模型构建方法研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5377194/latest

The thermal error samples of the machine tool feed system are limited and highly nonlinear, making it difficult for a single prediction model to accurately predict thermal errors under complex operating conditions. To improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a thermal error modeling method based on a fusion model of MCNN-LSTM-SVM tailored for small samples, combining deep learning with traditional machine learning algorithms. A Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) work in parallel to extract the spatial and temporal features of thermal characteristic data, respectively, addressing the issues of insufficient spatial feature extraction by single-scale convolutional networks and feature loss caused by serial processing of convolutional networks and LSTM. Additionally, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is introduced to replace the regression neural network layer for thermal error prediction, enhancing the prediction accuracy of small sample data. Experimental results demonstrate that the fusion model significantly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN, LSTM, and SVM in terms of RMSE, MAE, and Maximum Error (E-max), with a thermal error reduction approaching 75%. This provides an important reference for the application of this fusion model in thermal error compensation.

# Dual-Channel Branch Mechanism-basedVisual Defect Detection

## 基于双通道分支机构的视觉缺陷检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5417911/latest

Recently, defect detection has received widespread attention in the fields of graphic images and multimedia vision. Although existing visual detection methods have achieved promising performance, they are mainly targeted at object detection tasks under ideal conditions (sufficient lighting, clean background, etc.). When faced with complex and harsh conditions in reality (such as excessive line of sight and noisy background), the performance drops sharply. To address the potential hazards posed by abnormal interferences in power transmission lines due to natural environmental factors and human activities (such as bird nests, bird damage, foreign object coverage, and construction work), this paper proposes a defect detection algorithm for distribution lines based on a dual-branch mechanism. The proposed method first effectively locates and extracts the features of distribution line defects (bird nests, bird damage, foreign object coverage, and construction work). It then integrates a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, enhancing the prominence of defect areas to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model in target detection tasks. Finally, utilizing the dual-branch mechanism facilitates multi-task learning for both classification and regression training of defects. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the widely adopted standard architecture deep models in terms of effectiveness, better meeting the practical requirements of industrial inspections and the visual applications for graphic images. &nbsp;Source code can be found at: https://github.com/jxsiaj/DCBM.git.&nbsp;

The research that does exist usually considers task generalisation implicitly as a part of the environment, and when it is considered explicitly there are no theoretical guarantees. We propose Goal-Oriented Learning for Multi-Task Multi-Agent RL (GOLeMM), a method that achieves provably optimal task generalisation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been achieved before in multi-agent RL (MARL). After learning an optimal goal-oriented value function for a single arbitrary task, our method can zero-shot infer the optimal policy for any other task in the distribution---given only knowledge of the terminal rewards for each agent for the new task and learnt task. Empirically in a tabular domain we show that our method is able to generalise over a full task distribution, while representative baselines are only able to learn a small subset of the task distribution---given the same knowledge about tasks. Additionally, while leveraging function approximation we demonstrate our method in a high-dimensional continuous domain and obtain superior task generalisation than a representative baseline.

# A Scalable Machine Learning Strategy for Resource Allocation Database

## 一种可扩展的资源分配数据库机器学习策略

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5424573/latest

Efficiently responding to dynamic application demands in cloud environments is crucial for meeting service level agreements (SLAs) and optimizing resource costs. Traditional auto-scaling approaches often struggle with predefined rules, making it challenging to devise optimal adaptation strategies. This paper introduces a proactive strategy that leverages the robust capabilities of long short-term memory (LSTM) for precise request prediction, complemented by the intelligent decision-making power of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to determine optimal actions for scaling virtual machines.
In this proposed methodology, the LSTM accurately predicts the number of requests in the next time step, effectively adapting to dynamic traffic changes. The integration of MARL enhances the adaptability and efficiency of the auto-scaling process by enabling virtual machines to make informed decisions based on real time states.
This study asserts that applying MARL as a fundamental component of the auto-scaling strategy is a promising and effective solution. The synergy between LSTM and MARL based Ape-X not only enhances predictive accuracy but also empowers virtual machines to make proactive decisions, making it a valuable approach for meeting SLAs and optimizing resource utilization in dynamic cloud environments.

# Making Room for Friction:&nbsp; Boundary crossing in General Practitioners Residency

## 为摩擦腾出空间: 全科医生居住的边界跨越

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5374837/latest

Patient care is compromised when residents cannot use and connect knowledge and skills developed in multiple learning environments. Although efforts are made in postgraduate medical education (PGME) to align learning environments, the nature of learning in the workplace through patient care is fundamentally different from learning in a classroom at an educational institute. Residents perceive these learning environments as separate, non-overlapping worlds. However, residents' efforts to cross boundaries and connect multiple learning environments can provide important learning experiences and contribute to innovation. In this study, we investigated which learning mechanisms general practice (GP) residents use when crossing boundaries between the workplace and the educational institute. Understanding how residents cross these boundaries can facilitate connecting multiple learning and working environments. This can help innovate postgraduate medical education, considering ongoing societal changes and medical advances. We conducted a case study based on 3 cohorts of residents from an innovative GP residency program. This program included classroom-based and work-based training. Data were collected through individual interviews, focus groups, and activity logs between 2017 and 2021, and analyzed thematically. We identified four learning mechanisms that residents developed and used cumulatively. The first learning mechanisms are associated with friction and frustration, which must be overcome before residents can develop the next learning mechanism. Addressing friction and frustration in GP residency programs, along with providing adequate time and opportunities for peer collaboration, seems to facilitate the development of strategies to connect different learning environments. Furthermore, our study provides a basis for further research on how initial frustrations in connecting multiple learning environments can be used to benefit residents' development as professionals and lifelong learners.

# Intrinsic metal-support interactions break the activity-stability dilemma in electrocatalysis

## 内在的金属-载体相互作用打破了电催化中的活性-稳定性困境

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5208867/latest

Electrocatalysis plays a central role in clean energy conversion and sustainable technologies. However, the trade-off between activity and stability of electrocatalysts significantly hinders their practical applications, notably in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for producing hydrogen and solar fuels. Here we report a steam-assisted synthesis armed with machine learning screening of an integrated ruthenium-titanium-manganese electrode, featuring intrinsic metal-support interactions. These atomic-scale interactions with self-healing capabilities radically address the activity-stability dilemma across all pH levels. Consequently, our electrode achieved high mass activities, 48.5, 112.8 and 74.6 times those of benchmark ruthenium oxides in acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively; and stable operation for up to 3,000 hours, a multi-fold improvement in stability over the reported advanced catalysts. The breakthrough in activity-stability limitations highlights the potential of intrinsic metal-support interactions for enhancing electrolysis and other heterogeneous catalysis.

# Subtyping First-Episode Psychosis based on Longitudinal Symptom Trajectories Using Machine Learning

## 使用机器学习基于纵向症状轨迹对首发精神病进行分型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5406437/latest

Clinical course after first episode psychosis (FEP) is heterogeneous. Subgrouping longitudinal symptom trajectories after FEP would be useful for developing personalized treatment approaches, and being able to predict these trajectories at baseline would facilitate individual-level treatment planning. We utilized k-means clustering  to identify distinct clusters of 411 FEP patients based on longitudinal positive and negative symptom patterns. Ridge logistic regression was then used to identify predictors of cluster membership using baseline data. Three clusters were identified, demonstrating unique demographic, clinical and treatment response profiles. Cluster 1 exhibits lower positive and negative symptoms (LS), lower antipsychotic dose, and relatively higher affective psychosis; Cluster 2 shows lower positive symptoms, persistent negative symptoms (LPPN), and intermediate antipsychotic doses; Cluster 3 presents persistently high levels of both positive and negative symptoms (PPNS), as well as higher antipsychotic doses. We effectively predicted patients&rsquo; cluster membership (AUC of 0.74). The most important predictive features included contrasting trends of apathy, affective flattening, and anhedonia for the LS and LPPN clusters. Global hallucination severity, positive thought disorder and manic hostility predicted PPNS. These results help parse the heterogeneity of FEP trajectories and may facilitate the development of personalized treatment approaches tailored to cluster characteristics.

# &ldquo;There is no need to leave the beach to test&rdquo;: A qualitative study of HIV self-testing knowledge and acceptability of HIV self-test kit distribution among social networks of fishermen in western Kenya

## “没有必要离开海滩测试一下”: 肯尼亚西部渔民社交网络中HIV自我检测知识和HIV自我测试一下工具包分布的可接受性的定性研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5090648/latest

Background HIV self-testing (HIVST) can improve HIV testing uptake by offering convenience and privacy. Yet HIVST accessibility and uptake remain limited in Lake Victorias beach communities where HIVST holds promise to address many barriers highly mobile populations of men in fishing communities face. We assessed HIVST knowledge and acceptability among highly mobile fishermen, a high priority population for HIV prevention and treatment, participating in a social network-based study (&amp;ldquo;Owete&amp;rdquo;; NCT04772469) to promote HIV testing, prevention, and treatment in Kenya.Methods Sixty-five in-depth baseline interviews (IDIs) and two focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted at study baseline from December 2021 to June 2022 with fishermen, including 30 who were social network-central men recruited as HIVST &amp;ldquo;promoters&amp;rdquo; from three fishing communities along Lake Victoria, Kenya. Fishermen were purposively-sampled based on study arm, community and age (18&amp;ndash;34 and 35+) for interviews exploring HIVST knowledge, perceived benefits, and concerns. IDIs and FGDs were audio-recorded, translated/transcribed into English and inductively-coded and analyzed by six researchers using a framework approach.Results Nearly all participants had heard about HIVST and expressed willingness to self-test. Almost half reported learning about HIVST for the first time through the Owete study. Perceived benefits of self-testing included privacy, convenience, and being able to learn one&amp;rsquo;s status with the freedom to choose when and where to test, which minimized stigma and work interruptions. Few participants had used HIVST prior to joining Owete, all of whom reported ease of use. Potential barriers to HIVST included fear of HIV-seropositive results, feeling unsure about how to use HIVSTs, and fear of stigma if a HIVST was discovered. Nearly all Owete promoters indicated willingness to distribute HIVST to help their peers know their status. Promoters stressed the importance of approaching HIVST discussions strategically and thoughtfully to garner trust and engagement, and felt they needed training to answer HIVST questions.Conclusion While few fishermen had ever used HIVST, this study found high awareness, positive perceptions, and substantial willingness to use and distribute HIVST to other men. The &amp;ldquo;promoter&amp;rdquo; model, with known peers engaged in disseminating HIVST information and test kits, shows promise for engaging men in testing.

# Intelligent Monitoring and Fuzzy control of MIG welding seam tracking based on Passive visual Sensing

## 基于被动视觉传感的MIG焊焊缝跟踪智能监测与模糊控制

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5304510/latest

To reduce the risk of personnel operation and further improve welding efficiency, weld seam tracking in MIG welding process arc has to be developed for automatic manufacturing. Weld seam tracking system mainly contains intelligent monitoring and fuzzy control. For monitoring part, an optical testing platform and a passive visual detecting device are established to analyze groove and arc position. Also preprocessing workflow and adaptive enhancement algorithm are built to increase image gray values. Deep learning program is used to select and locate interest area to improve the accuracy of detection. The arc position calculation model is also proposed to extract geographic location. For control part, based on welder's operation skills, fuzzy logic rules are programmed to control the arc position at the middle of gap. Also control experiments are carried out and compared with manual adjustment. Results show that: (1) with preprocessing workflow and adaptive enhancement algorithm, the average gray value of the groove area and the arc area increased by 114% and 100%;(2) by using deep learning, the interest area, which contains information of groove shape and oscillating arc position and could be selected accurately, and the mAP index is as high as 99.27%. (3) based on the preset deviation test, the pixel error of the alignment deviation detection is within 8 pixels. And with the alignment deviation, distance can be controlled between &amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.5 mm.
