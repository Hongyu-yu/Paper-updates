# Machine Learning-Assisted Profiling of Ladder Polymer Structure using Scattering

## 使用散射的机器学习辅助的梯形聚合物结构轮廓分析

arXiv:2411.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ladder polymers, known for their rigid, ladder-like structures, exhibit exceptional thermal stability and mechanical strength, positioning them as candidates for advanced applications. However, accurately determining their structure from solution scattering remains a challenge. Their chain conformation is largely governed by the intrinsic orientational properties of the monomers and their relative orientations, leading to a bimodal distribution of bending angles, unlike conventional polymer chains whose bending angles follow a unimodal Gaussian distribution. Meanwhile, traditional scattering models for polymer chains do not account for these unique structural features. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates machine learning with Monte Carlo simulations to address this challenge. We first develop a Monte Carlo simulation for sampling the configuration space of ladder polymers, where each monomer is modeled as a biaxial segment. Then, we establish a machine learning-assisted scattering analysis framework based on Gaussian Process Regression. Finally, we conduct small-angle neutron scattering experiments on a ladder polymer solution to apply our approach. Our method uncovers structural details of ladder polymers that conventional methods fail to capture.

# A Toffoli Gadget for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions Boltzmann Machines

## 用于磁隧道结玻尔兹曼机的Toffoli小工具

arXiv:2411.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) are of great interest for non-conventional computing applications. The Toffoli gate is a universal reversible logic gate, enabling the construction of arbitrary boolean circuits. Here, we present a proof-of-concept construction of a gadget which encodes the Toffoli gate's truth table into the ground state of coupled uniaxial nanomagnets that could form the free layers of perpendicularly magnetized MTJs. This construction has three input bits, three output bits, and one ancilla bit. We numerically simulate the seven macrospins evolving under the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (s-LLG) equation. We investigate the effect of the anisotropy-to-exchange-coupling strength ratio $H_A/H_\text{ex}$ on the working of the gadget. We find that for $H_A/H_\text{ex} \lesssim 0.93$, the spins evolve to the Toffoli gate truth table configurations under LLG dynamics alone, while higher $H_A/H_\text{ex}$ ratios require thermal annealing due to suboptimal metastable states. Under our chosen annealing procedure, the s-LLG simulation with thermal annealing achieves a 100% success rate up to $H_A/H_\text{ex}\simeq3.0$. The feasibility of constructing MTJ-free-layer-based Toffoli gates highlights their potential in designing new types of MTJ-based circuits.

# In-situ Self-optimization of Quantum Dot Emission for Lasers by Machine-Learning Assisted Epitaxy

## 基于机器学习辅助外延的激光器量子点发射原位自优化

arXiv:2411.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for optimizing light source emissions rely on a time-consuming trial-and-error approach. While in-situ optimization of light source gain media emission during growth is ideal, it has yet to be realized. In this work, we integrate in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) with machine learning (ML) to correlate the surface reconstruction with the photoluminescence (PL) of InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs), which serve as the active region of lasers. A lightweight ResNet-GLAM model is employed for the real-time processing of RHEED data as input, enabling effective identification of optical performance. This approach guides the dynamic optimization of growth parameters, allowing real-time feedback control to adjust the QDs emission for lasers. We successfully optimized InAs QDs on GaAs substrates, with a 3.2-fold increase in PL intensity and a reduction in full width at half maximum (FWHM) from 36.69 meV to 28.17 meV under initially suboptimal growth conditions. Our automated, in-situ self-optimized lasers with 5-layer InAs QDs achieved electrically pumped continuous-wave operation at 1240 nm with a low threshold current of 150 A/cm2 at room temperature, an excellent performance comparable to samples grown through traditional manual multi-parameter optimization methods. These results mark a significant step toward intelligent, low-cost, and reproductive light emitters production.

# Modelling Silica using MACE-MP-0 Machine Learnt Interatomic Potentials

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00436

arXiv:2411.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silica polymorphs and zeolites are fundamental to a wide range of industrial applications owing to their diverse structural characteristics, thermodynamic and mechanical stability under varying conditions and due to their geological importance. Computational modelling has played a crucial role in understanding the relationship between the structure and functionality of silicas and silicates including zeolites. In this study, we apply the MACE-MP-0 machine learnt interatomic potentials (ML-IP) to model the framework energies of siliceous zeolites and examine the phase transitions of silica and ZSM-5 polymorphs under high-pressure conditions. The results reproduce the known metastability of siliceous zeolites relative to {\alpha}-quartz, with energy differences between microporous and dense phases calculated by MACE-MP-0 medium ML-IP and density functional theory (DFT) methods closely aligning with experimental calorimetric data. The high-pressure simulations reveal distinct compression behaviour in the quartz, coesite, and stishovite polymorphs of silica, with coesite and stishovite showing increased stability at elevated pressures in line with experimental data. The calculated phase transition pressures from quartz to coesite (~3.5 GPa) and coesite to stishovite (~9 GPa) are close to experimental findings, demonstrating the reliability of MACE ML-IP in modelling the structural and energetic properties of silica polymorphs.

# Latent heat estimation with machine learning

## 基于机器学习的潜热估计

arXiv:2411.00733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set out to explore the possibility of investigating the critical behavior of systems with first-order phase transition using deep machine learning. We propose a machine learning protocol with ternary classification of instantaneous spin configurations using known values of disordered phase energy and ordered phase energy. The trained neural network is used to predict whether a given sample belong to one or the other phase of matter. This allows us to estimate the probability that configurations with a certain energy belong to the ordered phase, mixed phase and, disordered phase. From these probabilities, we obtained estimates of the values of the critical energies and the latent heat for the Potts model with 10 and 20 components, which undergoes a strong discontinuous transition. We also find that the probabilities can reflect geometric transitions in the mixed phase.

arXiv:2411.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) are a powerful tool for addressing physical systems, particularly those governed by conservation laws. LNNs can parametrize the Lagrangian of a system to predict trajectories with nearly conserved energy. These techniques have proven effective in unconstrained systems as well as those with holonomic constraints. In this work, we adapt LNN techniques to mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints. We test our approach on some well-known examples with nonholonomic constraints, showing that incorporating these restrictions into the neural network's learning improves not only trajectory estimation accuracy but also ensures adherence to constraints and exhibits better energy behavior compared to the unconstrained counterpart.

arXiv:2411.00720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sustainable production of many bulk chemicals relies on heterogeneous catalysis. The rational design or improvement of the required catalysts critically depends on insights into the underlying mechanisms at the atomic scale. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in applying advanced experimental techniques to complex catalytic reactions in operando, but in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding, additional information from computer simulations is indispensable in many cases. In particular, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) has become an important tool to explicitly address the atomistic level structure, dynamics, and reactivity of interfacial systems, but the high computational costs limit applications to systems consisting of at most a few hundred atoms for simulation times of up to tens of picoseconds. Rapid advances in the development of modern machine learning potentials (MLP) now offer a new approach to bridge this gap, enabling simulations of complex catalytic reactions with ab initio accuracy at a small fraction of the computational costs. In this perspective, we provide an overview of the current state of the art of applying MLPs to systems relevant for heterogeneous catalysis along with a discussion of the prospects for the use of MLPs in catalysis science in the years to come.

arXiv:2402.13622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate popular resampling methods for estimating the uncertainty of statistical models, such as subsampling, bootstrap and the jackknife, and their performance in high-dimensional supervised regression tasks. We provide a tight asymptotic description of the biases and variances estimated by these methods in the context of generalized linear models, such as ridge and logistic regression, taking the limit where the number of samples $n$ and dimension $d$ of the covariates grow at a comparable fixed rate $\alpha\!=\! n/d$. Our findings are three-fold: i) resampling methods are fraught with problems in high dimensions and exhibit the double-descent-like behavior typical of these situations; ii) only when $\alpha$ is large enough do they provide consistent and reliable error estimations (we give convergence rates); iii) in the over-parametrized regime $\alpha\!<\!1$ relevant to modern machine learning practice, their predictions are not consistent, even with optimal regularization.

Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians provides access to an important set of chemical properties. Wavefunctions based on ML architectures have shown promise in approximating these ground states in a variety of physical systems. In this work, we show how to achieve state-of-the-art energies for molecular Hamiltonians using the the neural network backflow wave-function. To accomplish this, we optimize this ansatz with a variant of the deterministic optimization scheme based on SCI introduced by [Li, et. al JCTC (2023)] which we find works better than standard MCMC sampling. For the molecules we studied, NNBF gives lower energy states than both CCSD and other neural network quantum states. We systematically explore the role of network size as well as optimization parameters in improving the energy. We find that while the number of hidden layers and determinants play a minor role in improving the energy, there is significant improvements in the energy from increasing the number of hidden units as well as the batch size used in optimization with the batch size playing a more important role.

arXiv:2410.23858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.

arXiv:2411.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing has gained significant attention as a potential solution to the growing computational demands of machine learning, particularly for tasks requiring large-scale data processing and high energy efficiency. Optical systems offer promising alternatives to digital neural networks by exploiting light's parallelism. This study explores a photonic neural network design using spatiotemporal chaos within grad-ed-index multimode fibers to improve machine learning performance. Through numerical simulations and experiments, we show that chaotic light propagation in multimode fibers enhances data classification accu-racy across domains, including biomedical imaging, fashion, and satellite geospatial analysis. This chaotic optical approach enables high-dimensional transformations, amplifying data separability and differentiation for greater accuracy. Fine-tuning parameters such as pulse peak power optimizes the reservoir's chaotic properties, highlighting the need for careful calibration. These findings underscore the potential of chaos-based nonlinear photonic neural networks to advance optical computing in machine learning, paving the way for efficient, scalable architectures.

# Denoising study of Fluoroscopic Images in real time tumor tracking System based on Statistical model of noise

arXiv:2411.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the noise characteristics of intraoperative X-ray fluoroscopic images acquired during real-time image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and presents a novel noise image generation method based on the identified noise amplitude and spatial probability patterns. Initially, noise-free digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were generated using patient CT data combined with projection algorithms and the spatial configuration of the real-time tumor tracking system. Based on the observed noise probability and amplitude distributions, noise was then added to these DRRs to create Dataset 1. As a control, Dataset 2 was generated by adding Gaussian noise with the same mean and variance as Dataset 1; however, the noise probability in Dataset 2 is independent of pixel location and pixel intensity. Both datasets were used to fine-tune a pre-trained SwinIR model with identical training parameters. Tests on phantom images containing real noise show that the SwinIR model trained with the proposed noise model dataset achieves superior denoising performance over the model trained with Gaussian noise and the model without transfer learning, with an average PSNR improvement of 1.45 dB. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of noise patterns in these fluoroscopic images and is crucial for enhancing image quality and the accuracy of real-time tumor tracking in radiotherapy.

# All-Optical Excitable Spiking Laser Neuron in InP Generic Integration Technology

Abstract: Brain-inspired, neuromorphic devices implemented in integrated photonic hardware have attracted significant interest recently as part of efforts towards novel non-von Neumann computing paradigms that make use of the low loss, high-speed and parallel operations in optics. An all-optical spiking laser neuron fabricated on the indium-phosphide generic integration technology platform may be a practical alternative to other semi-integrated photonic and electronic-based spiking neuron implementations. Owing to the large number of predefined building blocks, a plethora of applications have benefitted already from the generic integration process. This technology platform has now been utilised for the first time to demonstrate an all-optical spiking laser neuron. This paper present and discusses the design and measurement of the ultra-fast and rich spiking dynamics in these devices. We show that under external pulse injection and operated slightly below the lasing threshold, the laser neuron exhibits an excitable mode, in addition to a self-spiking mode far above the threshold when no pulse is injected. In the excitable mode, the required injected pulse energy is much lower than that of the generated excited response, meeting an important requirement for neuron cascadability. In addition, we investigate excitability at different injection wavelengths below the lasing wavelength, as well as the ultra-fast temporal properties of the spiking response. All of the discussed characteristics point to the laser neuron being an important candidate for scaling up to future fully-connected, multi-wavelength all-optical photonic spiking neural networks in indium-phosphide generic integration technology.

Abstract: Purposes: This study aimed to develop a computed tomography (CT)-based multi-organ segmentation model for delineating organs-at-risk (OARs) in pediatric upper abdominal tumors and evaluate its robustness across multiple datasets. Materials and methods: In-house postoperative CTs from pediatric patients with renal tumors and neuroblastoma (n=189) and a public dataset (n=189) with CTs covering thoracoabdominal regions were used. Seventeen OARs were delineated: nine by clinicians (Type 1) and eight using TotalSegmentator (Type 2). Auto-segmentation models were trained using in-house (ModelPMC-UMCU) and a combined dataset of public data (Model-Combined). Performance was assessed with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and mean surface distance (MSD). Two clinicians rated clinical acceptability on a 5-point Likert scale across 15 patient contours. Model robustness was evaluated against sex, age, intravenous contrast, and tumor type. Results: Model-PMC-UMCU achieved mean DSC values above 0.95 for five of nine OARs, while spleen and heart ranged between 0.90 and 0.95. The stomach-bowel and pancreas exhibited DSC values below 0.90. Model-Combined demonstrated improved robustness across both datasets. Clinical evaluation revealed good usability, with both clinicians rating six of nine Type 1 OARs above four and six of eight Type 2 OARs above three. Significant performance 2 differences were only found across age groups in both datasets, specifically in the left lung and pancreas. The 0-2 age group showed the lowest performance. Conclusion: A multi-organ segmentation model was developed, showcasing enhanced robustness when trained on combined datasets. This model is suitable for various OARs and can be applied to multiple datasets in clinical settings.

# RAIDER: Rapid, anatomy-independent, deep learning-based PDFF and R2* estimation using magnitude-only signals

## RAIDER: 使用仅幅度信号的快速、独立于解剖学、基于深度学习的PDFF和R2 * 估计

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01178

arXiv:2403.01178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: There has been substantial recent interest in magnitude-based fitting methods for estimating proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and R2* from chemical shift-encoded MRI data, since these methods can still be used when complex-based methods fail or when phase data are inaccessible or unreliable, and may also be used as a final processing step with complex-based methods. However, conventional fitting techniques are computationally expensive. Deep learning (DL)-based methods promise to accelerate parameter estimation, but previous attempts have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are limited by training requirements and poor generalizability (anatomy-dependence). To address these limitations, we propose RAIDER, a voxelwise method for rapid, anatomy-independent deep learning-based PDFF and R2* estimation using multi-echo magnitude-data. Theory and Methods: RAIDER uses two multilayer perceptrons, each trained separately with simulated single-voxel multi-echo magnitude signals, to estimate PDFF and R2*. The use of two networks, each with restricted training distribution, solves the problem of degeneracy during training. During inference, the solution from one of the two networks is chosen based on likelihood. Performance and speed are investigated in a series of simulation experiments, in phantoms and in vivo. Results: RAIDER is 285-1450 times faster than conventional magnitude fitting, taking 1.4-2.3s per slice rather than 8-56minutes, and offers performance similar to conventional fitting. It produces accurate PDFF measurements in phantoms and in vivo images with different anatomies, despite having been trained only on simulation data. Conclusion: RAIDER can substantially accelerate magnitude-based PDFF and R2* estimation, whilst avoiding intrinsic limitations of CNN-based methods.

arXiv:2405.00636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection in the face of network perturbations, specifically edge deletions. Graph embedding techniques, which represent nodes as low-dimensional vectors, are widely used for various graph machine learning tasks due to their ability to capture structural properties of networks effectively. However, the impact of perturbations on the performance of these methods remains relatively understudied. The research considers state-of-the-art graph embedding methods from two families: matrix factorization (e.g., LE, LLE, HOPE, M-NMF) and random walk-based (e.g., DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec). Through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks, the study reveals varying degrees of robustness within each family of graph embedding methods. The robustness is found to be influenced by factors such as network size, initial community partition strength, and the type of perturbation. Notably, node2vec and LLE consistently demonstrate higher robustness for community detection across different scenarios, including networks with degree and community size heterogeneity. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate graph embedding method based on the specific characteristics of the network and the task at hand, particularly in scenarios where robustness to perturbations is crucial.

Abstract: Variational ab-initio methods in quantum chemistry stand out among other methods in providing direct access to the wave function. This allows in principle straightforward extraction of any other observable of interest, besides the energy, but in practice this extraction is often technically difficult and computationally impractical. Here, we consider the electron density as a central observable in quantum chemistry and introduce a novel method to obtain accurate densities from real-space many-electron wave functions by representing the density with a neural network that captures known asymptotic properties and is trained from the wave function by score matching and noise-contrastive estimation. We use variational quantum Monte Carlo with deep-learning ans\"atze (deep QMC) to obtain highly accurate wave functions free of basis set errors, and from them, using our novel method, correspondingly accurate electron densities, which we demonstrate by calculating dipole moments, nuclear forces, contact densities, and other density-based properties.

Abstract: We propose a micro-macro parallel-in-time Parareal method for scalar McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In the algorithm, the fine Parareal propagator is a Monte Carlo simulation of an ensemble of particles, while an approximate ordinary differential equation (ODE) description of the mean and the variance of the particle distribution is used as a coarse Parareal propagator to achieve speedup. We analyse the convergence behaviour of our method for a linear problem and provide numerical experiments indicating the parallel weak scaling of the algorithm on a set of examples. We show, with numerical experiments, that convergence typically takes place in a low number of iterations, depending on the quality of the ODE predictor. For bimodal SDEs, we avoid quality deterioration of the coarse predictor (compared to unimodal SDEs) through the usage of multiple ODEs, each describing the mean and variance of the particle distribution in locally unimodal regions of the phase space. The benefit of the proposed algorithm can be viewed through two lenses: (i) through the parallel-in-time lens, speedup is obtained through the use of a very cheap coarse integrator (an ODE moment model), and (ii) through the moment models lens, accuracy is iteratively gained through the use of parallel machinery as a corrector. In contrast to the isolated use of a moment model, the proposed method (iteratively) converges to the true distribution generated by the SDE.

# Scalable Training of Trustworthy and Energy-Efficient Predictive Graph Foundation Models for Atomistic Materials Modeling: A Case Study with HydraGNN

## 用于原子材料建模的可信赖且节能的预测图基础模型的可扩展训练: HydraGNN的案例研究

Abstract: We present our work on developing and training scalable, trustworthy, and energy-efficient predictive graph foundation models (GFMs) using HydraGNN, a multi-headed graph convolutional neural network architecture. HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) computations in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define nearest-neighbor convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFMs training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets consisting of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as energy and atomic forces. Using over 154 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two state-of-the-art United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier.

# Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential

## 神经网络矩阵乘积算子: 一种多维可积的机器学习势

arXiv:2410.23858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.

# Learning Macroscopic Dynamics from Partial Microscopic Observations

## 从部分微观观察中学习宏观动力学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23938

arXiv:2410.23938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic observables of a system are of keen interest in real applications such as the design of novel materials. Current methods rely on microscopic trajectory simulations, where the forces on all microscopic coordinates need to be computed or measured. However, this can be computationally prohibitive for realistic systems. In this paper, we propose a method to learn macroscopic dynamics requiring only force computations on a subset of the microscopic coordinates. Our method relies on a sparsity assumption: the force on each microscopic coordinate relies only on a small number of other coordinates. The main idea of our approach is to map the training procedure on the macroscopic coordinates back to the microscopic coordinates, on which partial force computations can be used as stochastic estimation to update model parameters. We provide a theoretical justification of this under suitable conditions. We demonstrate the accuracy, force computation efficiency, and robustness of our method on learning macroscopic closure models from a variety of microscopic systems, including those modeled by partial differential equations or molecular dynamics simulations.

# A Secure data-driven algorithm against malicious intrusion signals in mobile communication networks

## 移动通信网络中针对恶意入侵信号的安全数据驱动算法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5310069/latest

Intrusion signals in mobile communication networks are often disguised as normal communication signals to attack, which is highly covert. This makes it difficult to be accurately recognized and increases the danger of data leakage. For this reason, this paper proposes a full link security defense algorithm against malicious intrusion signals in mobile communication networks based on data-driven technique. This algorithm uses the support vector machine technology to construct an identification model against the malicious intrusion signal of the full link and introduces the firefly algorithm to optimize the support vector parameters of the model to ensure the accuracy of the model in identifying the malicious intrusion signal. In addition, this algorithm uses a network full link security defense model based on dynamic camouflage technology to dynamically simulate any element of the full link in the mobile communication network, and at the same time constructs heterogeneous executives to distribute the results of the malicious intrusion signal to each selected heterogeneous executor. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can accurately identify different types of malicious intrusion type signal samples, so that the interception rate of the intrusion defense system against malicious intrusion signals is greater than 99%, and the important data loss rate is less than 1%.

# JND-Based Illumination Compensationand DoG-Mask RCNN Optimization forAccurate Radish Image&nbsp; Segmentation

## 基于JND的光照补偿和DoG-Mask RCNN优化的萝卜图像精确分割

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5285927/latest

The widespread application of deep learning in the agricultural field has advanced radish segmentation and detection technologies. However, the issue of high dynamic range in backlit images captured by smartphones affects the monitoring of radish growth. Deep learning-based methods tend to perform poorly in complex lighting conditions, struggling with background interference, overexposure, and information loss. In this paper, we propose a new DoG-Mask RCNN network based on JND (Just Noticeable Difference) visual contrast compensation preprocessing. The network incorporates data preprocessing techniques for challenging environments as input, where the DoG layer is used to suppress overexposure in special conditions and filter out irrelevant background information. This layer retains spot details through its filtering capabilities, while the increment layer ensures the integrity of the feature information. We conducted experiments on radish mixed with traditional crops in different challenging environments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting radish parts under various conditions. Compared to the latest monitoring methods, our approach shows better detection stability.

# A Reconstructed Priority Assignment Method for Computationally Intensive Task Offloading in Mobile Communication Networks

## 移动通信网络中用于计算密集型任务卸载的重构优先级分配方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5308180/latest

Computationally intensive tasks often require substantial energy support, and mobile devices may experience slow task execution, response delays, and device overheating due to insufficient processing capabilities. By offloading computationally intensive tasks, the energy consumption of mobile devices can be reduced, and the resource utilization and network balance of mobile communication networks can be improved. Therefore, this paper designs a refactored priority division method for offloading computationally intensive tasks in mobile communication networks. This method first calculates the execution delay and energy consumption of mobile communication network system devices, mobile edge computing servers, and cloud servers, and uses these as factors for the refactored priority division of computationally intensive tasks. Then, it employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to refactor the priority division of computationally intensive tasks in mobile communication networks. In addition, deep reinforcement learning is used to comprehensively consider multiple factors such as delay and energy consumption to find the optimal offloading decision. Experimental results show that this method can effectively offload computationally intensive tasks from mobile devices and mobile edge computing servers and improve the balance of mobile communication networks.

# Material discovery of secondary and natural cementitious precursors

## 二次和天然胶凝前体的材料发现

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5342559/latest

Cement production contributes to over 6% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driven by clinker&rsquo;s energy-intensive production and limestone calcination. Substituting clinker with cementitious substitutes is an effective strategy for decarbonization. However, typical clinker substitutes---coal fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag---face current and future supply constraints. Here we systematically map reactivity variations and expand the repertoire of secondary and natural cementitious precursors. Large language models extract chemical compositions and material types of 14,000 materials from 88,000 academic papers. A multi-headed neural network predicts the degree of cementitious reactivity and pozzolanicity. Subject to performance constraints, current supply allows for substituting half of global cement production with construction and demolition wastes and municipal solid waste incineration ash, reducing the global GHG emissions by 3%---equating to removing 260 million vehicles from the roads in United States. Discovered natural cementitious precursors, including rhyolite, dacite, and gabbro, are distributed globally and show significant potential as raw substitutes for clinker.

# Wideband ratiometric measurement of tonic and phasic dopamine release in the striatum

## 纹状体中强直性和阶段性多巴胺释放的宽带比率测量

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5296053/latest

Reward learning, cognition, and motivation are supported by changes in neurotransmitter levels across multiple timescales. Current measurement technologies for various neuromodulators (such as dopamine and serotonin) do not bridge timescales of fluctuations, limiting the ability to define the behavioral significance, regulation, and relationship between fast (phasic) and slow (tonic) dynamics. To help resolve longstanding debates about the behavioral significance of dopamine across timescales, we developed a novel quantification strategy, augmenting extensively used carbon-fiber Fast Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV). We iteratively engineered the FSCV scan sequence to rapidly modify electrode sensitivity within a sampling window and applied ratiometric analysis for wideband dopamine measurement. This allowed us to selectively eliminate artifacts unrelated to electrochemical detection (i.e., baseline drift), overcoming previous limitations that precluded wideband dopamine detection from milliseconds to hours. After extensive characterization and validation in vitro and in vivo with simultaneous microdialysis, pharmacological, reward, and optogenetic manipulations, we demonstrate the utility of ratiometric FSCV to resolve key questions about how phasic DA transients contribute to setting striatal DA tone. We identify specific DA frequency bands that correlate with canonical microdialysis-defined &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; DA levels while also uncovering a paradoxical constraint on the accumulation of phasic DA into tonic levels. Our approach can extend to additional analytes, including serotonin, empowering the emperical testing of contrasting predictions from theories about neuromodulator circuit and computaional mechanisms that support behavioral flexibility.

# Synthetic Data for Accessible Learning in Healthcare: Improving Mortality Prediction with Longitudinal Data

## 医疗保健中无障碍学习的合成数据: 通过纵向数据改善死亡率预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5363467/latest

Accurate prediction of medium-term survival after admission is necessary for identifying end-of-life patients who may benefit from earlier goals of care (GOC) discussions. While previous studies have leveraged admission data from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict the hospital one-year mortality risk (HOMR) score, they focused on single admissions, without considering longitudinal patient history and its impact on prognostication. &amp;nbsp;To address this gap, we developed the Ensemble Long Short-Term Memory (ELSTM) neural network, which learns from multiple visits of the same patient to improve the accuracy of the HOMR score. Furthermore, in this work, we generated a synthetic dataset and made it publicly available to encourage further research in this area while safeguarding patient privacy.

# Advanced Neural Analysis for Ransomware Detection Through Dynamic Network Signature Mapping

## 通过动态网络签名映射进行勒索软件检测的高级神经分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5369384/latest

Dynamic Network Signature Mapping (DNSM) is introduced as a novel and advanced approach for detecting ransomware threats through adaptive, real-time analysis of network traffic patterns. Utilizing an integrated framework of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, DNSM captures spatial and temporal dependencies within network data, enabling precise classification of ransomware activities even under encrypted or high-volume conditions. Unlike traditional, signature-based methods, DNSM constructs a dynamic and evolving threat profile that reduces the need for manual updates, thereby improving adaptability to emerging ransomware techniques. Empirical results from the study validate DNSM&rsquo;s ability to maintain high detection accuracy and low false positive rates across a spectrum of network environments, while demonstrating efficient real-time performance critical for high-stakes operational contexts. The modularity of DNSM, coupled with its automated threat scoring and pattern recognition capabilities, establishes it as a resilient solution that addresses the demands of modern ransomware detection, offering a scalable, resource-effective alternative for proactive network security.

# Analysis of GLCM-feature-based dimensionality reduction and feature extraction methods for classifying fabric design patterns by using video data

## 利用视频数据分析基于GLCM特征的织物设计图案降维与特征提取方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5370165/latest

Manufacturing industries now leverage high-dimensional streaming video data from diverse sensors, represented as tensors (multidimensional arrays of channels &amp;times; signals &amp;times; time), for real-time monitoring, inspection, and quality control; however, this data often contains redundancy and captures only a subset of the complete dataset. Selecting effective dimensionality reduction and feature extraction methods for high-dimensional data structures remains challenging. To address these challenges, this paper presents a comparative framework for effective dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, utilizing supervised methods&amp;mdash;Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA)&amp;mdash;alongside the unsupervised Multilinear-PCA (MPCA), which can more effectively handle multidimensional tensor structures compared to the 1-D or 2-D limitations of PCA and ICA. We evaluate this comparative framework for classifying fabric design patterns using high-dimensional video data captured from various fabric surface weave patterns. The videos are converted into sequential RGB frames and analyzed using the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) for feature extraction, after which the dimensionality of the GLCM features is reduced with PCA, ICA, and MPCA, and the features are classified using supervised machine learning techniques for fabric design pattern recognition. MPCA achieves a 0.022% dimensionality reduction by extracting uniformly distributed features that effectively capture correlated fabric design patterns, unlike the less organized distributions from PCA and ICA. The fabric pattern classification accuracy achieved with MPCA, PCA, and ICA was 99.02%, 95.21%, and 92.68%, respectively. These results suggest that the proposed framework effectively facilitates dimensionality reduction and feature extraction in both supervised and unsupervised methods for high-dimensional video data.
