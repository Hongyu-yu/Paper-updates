# Machine Learning Domain Adaptation in Spin Models with Continuous Phase Transitions

## 具有连续相变的自旋模型中的机器学习域自适应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13027

arXiv:2411.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main question raised in the letter is the applicability of a neural network trained on a spin lattice model in one universality class to test a model in another universality class. The quantities of interest are the critical phase transition temperature and the correlation length exponent. In other words, the question of transfer learning is how ``universal'' the trained network is and under what conditions. The traditional approach with training and testing spin distributions turns out to be inapplicable for this purpose. Instead, we propose to use training and testing on binding energy distributions, which leads to successful estimates of the critical temperature and correlation length exponent for cross-tested Baxter-Wu and Ising models belonging to different universality classes.

# Dyson Brownian motion and random matrix dynamics of weight matrices during learning

## 学习过程中权值矩阵的Dyson布朗运动和随机矩阵动力学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13512

arXiv:2411.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During training, weight matrices in machine learning architectures are updated using stochastic gradient descent or variations thereof. In this contribution we employ concepts of random matrix theory to analyse the resulting stochastic matrix dynamics. We first demonstrate that the dynamics can generically be described using Dyson Brownian motion, leading to e.g. eigenvalue repulsion. The level of stochasticity is shown to depend on the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, explaining the empirically observed linear scaling rule. We verify this linear scaling in the restricted Boltzmann machine. Subsequently we study weight matrix dynamics in transformers (a nano-GPT), following the evolution from a Marchenko-Pastur distribution for eigenvalues at initialisation to a combination with additional structure at the end of learning.

# Recovering Mullins damage hyperelastic behaviour with physics augmented neural networks

## 用物理增强神经网络恢复Mullins损伤超弹性行为

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13185

arXiv:2411.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to develop a neural network for modelling incompressible hyperelastic behaviour with isotropic damage, the so-called Mullins effect. This is obtained through the use of feed-forward neural networks with special attention to the architecture of the network in order to fulfil several physical restrictions such as objectivity, polyconvexity, non-negativity, material symmetry and thermodynamic consistency. The result is a compact neural network with few parameters that is able to reconstruct the hyperelastic behaviour with Mullinstype damage. The network is trained with artificially generated plane stress data and even correctly captures the full 3D behaviour with much more complex loading conditions. The energy and stress responses are correctly captured, as well as the evolution of the damage. The resulting neural network can be seamlessly implemented in widely used simulation software. Implementation details are provided and all numerical examples are performed in Abaqus.

# Solver-in-the-loop approach to turbulence closure

## 湍流封闭的求解器在环方法

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13194

arXiv:2411.13194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for modeling the influence of the unresolved scales of turbulence for sub-grid modeling. Our approach employs the differentiable physics paradigm in deep learning, allowing a neural network to interact with the differential equation evolution and performing an a posteriori optimization by incorporating the solver into the training iteration (an approach known as solver-in-the-loop), thus departing from the conventional a priori instantaneous training approach. Our method ensures that the model is exposed to equations-informed input distributions, accounting for prior corrections and often leading to more accurate and stable time evolution. We present results of our methodology applied to a shell model of turbulence, and we discuss further potential applications to Navier-Stokes equations.

# A Systematic Review of Empirical Research on Graphing Numerical Data in K-12 STEM Education

## K-12 STEM教育中数字数据图形化实证研究的系统综述

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13195

arXiv:2411.13195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are essential representations in the professions and education concerning the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Beyond their academic relevance, graphs find extensive utility in everyday scenarios, ranging from news media to educational materials. This underscores the importance of people's being able to understand graphs. However, the ability to understand graphs is connected to the ability to create graphs. Therefore, in school education, particularly in STEM subjects, not only the understanding but also the skill of constructing graphs from numerical data is emphasized. Although constructing graphs is a skill that most people do not require in their everyday lives and professions, it is a well-established student activity that has been empirically studied several times. Therefore, since a synthesis of the research findings on this topic has not yet been conducted, a summary of the studies investigating graphing via various viewpoints and differing methods could be a valuable contribution. To provide an overview of the empirical literature on this important topic, our systematic review identifies how the construction of convention-based graphical representations of numerical data, referred to as graphing, has been studied in previous research, how effective graphing is, and which types of difficulties are encountered by students. Based on these aspects, we defined inclusion criteria that led to 50 peer-reviewed empirical studies on graphing in K-12 STEM education found in SCOPUS, ERIC, and PsychInfo. Graphing instruction seemed to be beneficial for student learning, not only improving graph construction but also graph interpretation skills. However, the students experienced various difficulties during graphing, both during graph construction and the interpretation and usage of data.

arXiv:2411.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturized (mini-) spectrometers are highly desirable tools for chemical, biological, and medical diagnostics because of their potential for portable and in situ spectral detection. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a mini-spectrometer that combines a large-scale radiative cavity array with end-to-end deep learning networks. Specifically, we utilize high-Q bound states in continuum cavities with distinct radiation characteristics as the fundamental units to achieve parallel spectral detection. We realize a 36 $\times$ 30 cavity array that spans a wide spectral range from 1525 to 1605 nm with quality factors above 10^4. We further train a deep network with 8000 outputs to directly map arbitrary spectra to array responses excited by the out-of-plane incident. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mini-spectrometer can resolve unknown spectra with a resolution of 0.048 nm in a bandwidth of 80 nm and fidelity exceeding 95%, thus offering a promising method for compact, high resolution, and broadband spectroscopy.

# Integration of Active Learning and MCMC Sampling for Efficient Bayesian Calibration of Mechanical Properties

## 主动学习和MCMC采样的集成，用于机械性能的有效贝叶斯校准

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13361

arXiv:2411.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and surrogate modelling have significantly enhanced the feasibility of Bayesian analysis across engineering fields. However, the selection and integration of surrogate models and cutting-edge MCMC algorithms, often depend on ad-hoc decisions. A systematic assessment of their combined influence on analytical accuracy and efficiency is notably lacking. The present work offers a comprehensive comparative study, employing a scalable case study in computational mechanics focused on the inference of spatially varying material parameters, that sheds light on the impact of methodological choices for surrogate modelling and sampling. We show that a priori training of the surrogate model introduces large errors in the posterior estimation even in low to moderate dimensions. We introduce a simple active learning strategy based on the path of the MCMC algorithm that is superior to all a priori trained models, and determine its training data requirements. We demonstrate that the choice of the MCMC algorithm has only a small influence on the amount of training data but no significant influence on the accuracy of the resulting surrogate model. Further, we show that the accuracy of the posterior estimation largely depends on the surrogate model, but not even a tailored surrogate guarantees convergence of the MCMC.Finally, we identify the forward model as the bottleneck in the inference process, not the MCMC algorithm. While related works focus on employing advanced MCMC algorithms, we demonstrate that the training data requirements render the surrogate modelling approach infeasible before the benefits of these gradient-based MCMC algorithms on cheap models can be reaped.

# Recitation tasks revamped? Evaluation of smartphone experiment tasks in introductory mechanics

## 背诵任务修改了吗？入门力学中智能手机实验任务的评估

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13382

arXiv:2411.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an approach to integrate innovative forms of recitation tasks into first-year introductory mechanics, with a primary focus on smartphone-based experimental tasks and additional programming tasks for comparison. Smartphones enable inexpensive physics experiments with digitized first-hand data collection outside lab settings. Such student experiments can enhance homework assignments, breaking down barriers between lectures, recitation groups, and labs, and thereby linking theoretical and experimental aspects of undergraduate physics education. To explore this potential, we implemented and evaluated a sample set of nine smartphone-based experimental tasks and three programming tasks as weekly exercises in a first-year physics course at RWTH Aachen University. Through twelve short surveys involving up to 188 participants, we investigated students' perceptions of learning with the new tasks, focusing on factors such as goal clarity, difficulty, or feasibility at home. In two additional surveys with 108 and 78 participants, students compared the new experimental and programming tasks to each other and to standard recitation tasks based on affective variables. Our findings indicate that the smartphone-based experimental tasks were generally well-suited to the students, which tended to outperform the programming tasks in terms of perceptions of learning with the tasks and affective responses. Overall, students responded positively to the new experimental tasks, with perceptions comparable to, or only partly below those of established standard recitation tasks. Given that most of the experimental tasks were newly implemented "on-the-fly" within a running course, while the standard recitation tasks have been refined over years, these results are encouraging. They suggest that smartphone-based experimental tasks can be successfully integrated into teaching.

# Online Optimisation of Machine Learning Collision Models to Accelerate Direct Molecular Simulation of Rarefied Gas Flows

## 机器学习碰撞模型的在线优化，以加速稀薄气流的直接分子模拟

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13423

arXiv:2411.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an online optimisation algorithm for in situ calibration of collision models in simulations of rarefied gas flows. The online optimised collision models are able to achieve similar accuracy to Direct Molecular Simulation (DMS) at significantly reduced computational cost for 1D normal shocks in argon across a wide range of temperatures and Mach numbers. DMS is a method of simulating rarefied gases which numerically integrates the trajectories of colliding molecules. It often achieves similar fidelity to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which fully resolve the trajectories of all particles at all times. However, DMS is substantially more computationally expensive than the popular Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, which uses simple phenomenological models of the collisions. We aim to accelerate DMS by replacing the computationally costly Classical Trajectory Calculations (CTC) with a neural network collision model. A key feature of our approach is that the machine learning (ML) collision model is optimised online during the simulation on a small dataset of CTC trajectories generated in situ during simulations. The online Machine Learning DMS (ML-DMS) is able to reproduce the accuracy of MD and CTC-DMS for 1D normal shocks in argon at a significantly lower computational cost (by a factor of $\sim5$--$15$), at a wide range of physical conditions (Mach numbers $1.55\leq \text{Ma}\leq 50 $, densities $\sim 10^{-4}\text{kg}\text{m}^{-3}$ to $1\text{kg}\text{m}^{-3}$, and temperatures 16K to 300K). We also derive an online optimisation method for calibration of DSMC collision models given a model of the interatomic forces. In our numerical evaluations for 1D normal shocks, the online optimisation method matches or significantly improves the accuracy of VHS (Variable Hard Sphere) DSMC with respect to CTC-DMS (with a $\sim20 \times$ lower computational cost).

# Tree Species Classification using Machine Learning and 3D Tomographic SAR -- a case study in Northern Europe

## 基于机器学习和三维层析SAR的树种分类 -- 以北欧为例

arXiv:2411.12897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree species classification plays an important role in nature conservation, forest inventories, forest management, and the protection of endangered species. Over the past four decades, remote sensing technologies have been extensively utilized for tree species classification, with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) emerging as a key technique. In this study, we employed TomoSense, a 3D tomographic dataset, which utilizes a stack of single-look complex (SLC) images, a byproduct of SAR, captured at different incidence angles to generate a three-dimensional representation of the terrain. Our research focuses on evaluating multiple tabular machine-learning models using the height information derived from the tomographic image intensities to classify eight distinct tree species. The SLC data and tomographic imagery were analyzed across different polarimetric configurations and geosplit configurations. We investigated the impact of these variations on classification accuracy, comparing the performance of various tabular machine-learning models and optimizing them using Bayesian optimization. Additionally, we incorporated a proxy for actual tree height using point cloud data from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to provide height statistics associated with the model's predictions. This comparison offers insights into the reliability of tomographic data in predicting tree species classification based on height.

# Machine learned reconstruction of tsunami dynamics from sparse observations

## 从稀疏观测中机器学习重建海啸动力学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12948

arXiv:2411.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of the Senseiver, a transformer neural network designed for sparse sensing applications, to estimate full-field surface height measurements of tsunami waves from sparse observations. The model is trained on a large ensemble of simulated data generated via a shallow water equations solver, which we show to be a faithful reproduction for the underlying dynamics by comparison to historical events. We train the model on a dataset consisting of 8 tsunami simulations whose epicenters correspond to historical USGS earthquake records, and where the model inputs are restricted to measurements obtained at actively deployed buoy locations. We test the Senseiver on a dataset consisting of 8 simulations not included in training, demonstrating its capability for extrapolation. The results show remarkable resolution of fine scale phase and amplitude features from the true field, provided that at least a few of the sensors have obtained a non-zero signal. Throughout, we discuss which forecasting techniques can be improved by this method, and suggest ways in which the flexibility of the architecture can be leveraged to incorporate arbitrary remote sensing data (eg. HF Radar and satellite measurements) as well as investigate optimal sensor placements.

# Advancing Heatwave Forecasting via Distribution Informed-Graph Neural Networks (DI-GNNs): Integrating Extreme Value Theory with GNNs

arXiv:2411.13496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heatwaves, prolonged periods of extreme heat, have intensified in frequency and severity due to climate change, posing substantial risks to public health, ecosystems, and infrastructure. Despite advancements in Machine Learning (ML) modeling, accurate heatwave forecasting at weather scales (1--15 days) remains challenging due to the non-linear interactions between atmospheric drivers and the rarity of these extreme events. Traditional models relying on heuristic feature engineering often fail to generalize across diverse climates and capture the complexities of heatwave dynamics. This study introduces the Distribution-Informed Graph Neural Network (DI-GNN), a novel framework that integrates principles from Extreme Value Theory (EVT) into the graph neural network architecture. DI-GNN incorporates Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD)-derived descriptors into the feature space, adjacency matrix, and loss function to enhance its sensitivity to rare heatwave occurrences. By prioritizing the tails of climatic distributions, DI-GNN addresses the limitations of existing methods, particularly in imbalanced datasets where traditional metrics like accuracy are misleading. Empirical evaluations using weather station data from British Columbia, Canada, demonstrate the superior performance of DI-GNN compared to baseline models. DI-GNN achieved significant improvements in balanced accuracy, recall, and precision, with high AUC and average precision scores, reflecting its robustness in distinguishing heatwave events.

Abstract: In this paper, we numerically optimize broadband pulse shapes that maximize Hahn echo amplitudes. Pulses are parameterized as neural networks (NN), nonlinear amplitude limited Fourier series (FS), and discrete time series (DT). These are compared to an optimized choice of the conventional hyperbolic secant (HS) pulse shape. A power constraint is included, as are realistic shape distortions due to power amplifier nonlinearity and the transfer function of the microwave resonator. We find that the NN, FS, and DT parameterizations perform equivalently, offer improvements over the best HS pulses, and contain a large number of equivalent optimal solutions, implying the flexibility to include further constraints or optimization goals in future designs.

# Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U

arXiv:2407.12432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.

Abstract: Diffractive Neural Networks (DNNs) leverage the power of light to enhance computational performance in machine learning, offering a pathway to high-speed, low-energy, and large-scale neural information processing. However, most existing DNN architectures are optimized for single tasks and thus lack the flexibility required for the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks within a unified artificial intelligence platform. In this work, we utilize the polarization and wavelength degrees of freedom of light to achieve optical multi-task identification using the MNIST, FMNIST, and KMNIST datasets. Employing bilayer cascaded metasurfaces, we construct dual-channel DNNs capable of simultaneously classifying two tasks, using polarization and wavelength multiplexing schemes through a meta-atom library. Numerical evaluations demonstrate performance accuracies comparable to those of individually trained single-channel, single-task DNNs. Extending this approach to three-task parallel recognition reveals an expected performance decline yet maintains satisfactory classification accuracies of greater than 80% for all tasks. We further introduce a novel end-to-end joint optimization framework to redesign the three-task classifier, demonstrating substantial improvements over the meta-atom library design and offering the potential for future multi-channel DNN designs. Our study could pave the way for the development of ultrathin, high-speed, and high-throughput optical neural computing systems.

Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting systems are vital for understanding marine dynamics, which play a crucial role in environmental management and climate adaptation strategies. Traditional numerical solvers, while effective, are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements in machine learning have revolutionized weather forecasting, offering fast and energy-efficient alternatives.

Abstract: We present jf1uids, a one-dimensional fluid solver that can, by virtue of a geometric formulation of the Euler equations, model radially symmetric fluid problems in a conservative manner, i.e., without losing mass or energy. For spherical problems, such as ideal supernova explosions or stellar wind-blown bubble expansions, simulating only along a radial dimension drastically reduces compute and memory demands compared to a full three-dimensional method. This simplification also alleviates constraints on backpropagation through the solver. Written in JAX, jf1uids is a GPU-compatible and fully differentiable simulator. We demonstrate the advantages of this differentiable physics simulator by retrieving the wind's parameters for an adiabatic stellar wind expansion from the final fluid state using gradient descent. As part of a larger "stellar winds, cosmic rays and machine learning" research track, jf1uids serves as a solid foundation to be extended with additional physics modules, foremost cosmic rays and a neural-net powered gas-cooling surrogate and improved by higher order and more accurate numerical schemes. All code is available under https://github.com/leo1200/jf1uids/.

Abstract: Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics, heralding a new era of applications from neuromorphic computing to artificial intelligence. However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation depth. For the first time, we reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss of <2 dB/cm, high precision exceeding 6-bits, large modulation depth with an index change as large as 4.6x10-3. Additionally, these devices offer impressive stability, maintaining minimal wavelength variation for over three weeks and enduring more than 10,000 cycles, and require a mere 0.8 pJ of energy for non-volatile operation. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical modulation. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed (48 Gbps) and energy-efficient (450 fJ/bit) signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.

arXiv:2411.10191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seamless forecasting that produces warning information at continuum timescales based on only one system is a long-standing pursuit for weather-climate service. While the rapid advancement of deep learning has induced revolutionary changes in classical forecasting field, current efforts are still focused on building separate AI models for weather and climate forecasts. To explore the seamless forecasting ability based on one AI model, we propose FengWu-Weather to Subseasonal (FengWu-W2S), which builds on the FengWu global weather forecast model and incorporates an ocean-atmosphere-land coupling structure along with a diverse perturbation strategy. FengWu-W2S can generate 6-hourly atmosphere forecasts extending up to 42 days through an autoregressive and seamless manner. Our hindcast results demonstrate that FengWu-W2S reliably predicts atmospheric conditions out to 3-6 weeks ahead, enhancing predictive capabilities for global surface air temperature, precipitation, geopotential height and intraseasonal signals such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

The prediction of the geometry and strength governing small molecule-protein interactions remains a paramount challenge in drug discovery due to their complex and dynamic nature. A number of machine learning (ML) methods have been proposed to complement and improve on physics-based tools such as molecular docking, usually by mapping three dimensional features of individual poses to their closeness to experimental structures and/or to binding affinities. Here, we introduce Dockbox2 (DBX2), a novel approach that encodes ensembles of computational poses within a graph neural network architecture via simple energy-based features derived from molecular docking. The model was jointly trained to predict binding pose likelihood as a node-level task and binding affinity as a graph-level task using the PDBbind dataset and demonstrated significant performance in comprehensive, retrospective docking and virtual screening experiments. Our results encourage further exploration of ML models based on conformational ensembles to provide more accurate estimates of small molecule-protein interactions and thermodynamics. The DBX2 code is available at https://github.com/jp43/DockBox2.

# Collective Coordinates and Facilitated Conformational Opening during Translocation of Human Mitochondrial RNA Polymerase (POLRMT) from Atomic Simulations

## 原子模拟的人类线粒体RNA聚合酶 (POLRMT) 易位过程中的集体坐标和促进构象开放

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-kwx47?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Collective coordinate (CV) identification is challenging in complex dynamical systems. To study translocation of a single-subunit RNA polymerase (RNAP) during human mitochondrial transcription, we employed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) as a vehicle to illustrate CV refinement in conformational samplings and dimension reduction analyses. The RNAP translocation is an essential mechanical step of the transcription elongation that dictates gene expression. The translocation generally follows from polymerization product release and proceeds to initial binding or pre-insertion of incoming nucleotides. The human mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNAP (or POLRMT) plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and can be a key molecular off-target in the design of nucleotide analogue antiviral and antitumor drugs due to its structural similarities with many viral RNAPs or RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). While POLRMT shares particularly high structural similarity with bacteriophage T7 RNAP, previous experimental studies and our current simulations suggest that POLRMT’s mechano-chemical coupling mechanisms may be distinct. In our current work, we modeled POLRMT elongation complexes and performed equilibrium MD simulations on the pre- and post-translocation models, with extensive samplings around different potential translocation paths (with or without coupling to the fingers subdomain conformational change). We then compared time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) and the neural network implementation of the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMPnets) as dimensional reduction methods on selected atomic CV sets to best represent the sampled data from the MD simulations. Our results indicate that POLRMT translocation is likely coupled with and facilitated by NTP binding to enable fingers subdomain opening at post-translocation which would otherwise be non-stabilized, or the translocations may proceed in futile without leading to the fingers opening for incoming NTP initial binding or incorporation. The timescale of the NTP binding-coupled or facilitated translocation reaches over hundreds of microseconds as predicted by the VAMPnets analyses. Such a timescale seems to match a last post-catalytic kinetic step suggested for the POLRMT elongation cycle by previous experimental detections. By inclusion of NTP binding/catalytic motifs into the analyses, the predicted time scale slightly increases as if additional protein dynamics related to NTP binding activities are considered. Thus, our MD simulation studies combining CV refinements and dimension reduction analyses on top of extensive conformational samplings suggest a distinct mechano-chemical coupling mechanism of POLRMT translocation as if the Brownian motions are slightly assisted by NTP binding.

## 基于机器学习的移动网络流量预测和网络负载预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5480268/latest

Precisely, the accuracy in predicting network traffic with precise forecasting of load at the right time are very important because they contribute directly towards the optimal distribution of resources and prevention of future congestion in mobile networks. This work is based on predicting future network traffic patterns and load through the implementation of machine learning methods applied based on supervised algorithms, like Random Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The proposed models use historical network data, environmental factors, and user behaviour to make real-time predictions about the traffic demand under which network resources can proactively be adjusted in advance. The experiments show that the machine learning-based models have better performance than the traditional ones, which means a higher accuracy in traffic demand prediction and better effectiveness in network management. This study shows how powerful machine learning is in making mobile networks offer better performance and reliability through effective ensuring optimal resource distribution and resisting congestion.

# Oxidative stress-related genes as diagnostic markers for endometriosis and their associated immunoassays

## 氧化应激相关基因作为子宫内膜异位症的诊断标志物及其相关免疫分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5483387/latest

Purpose Endometriosis (EMT) affects millions of women worldwide and is closely associated with the body's response to oxidative stress. The role of oxidative stress markers in the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis is a potentially fruitful avenue of research.Methods In this study, we employed a machine learning approach to model and screen key biomarkers, integrating five independent datasets from the Omnibus (GEO) database to construct a comprehensive training set. The identification of key genes was achieved through a process of cross-referencing with the aim of locating those that were differentially expressed and known to be involved in oxidative stress. Nine machine learning algorithms were employed for model selection, followed by the evaluation of immune infiltration and immune correlation through single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and the CIBERSORT algorithm.Results After comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms, the gradient boosting algorithm (GBM) was selected as the best model. Eventually it screened five featured genes (FOS, CFH, AOX1, FMO1, FCGR2B). The expression patterns of these genes showed diagnostic and predictive potential in the constructed nomograms and external validation. In addition, the association of these genes with pregnancy status and disease severity was explored. The results of immune infiltration analysis showed significant correlation between these key genes and the immune system.Conclusions This study identifies genes at the intersection of endometriosis and oxidative stress, thereby providing reliable molecular markers for clinical application. This offers a new avenue for subsequent diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.

# R3D: an approach combining cost-sensitive and insensitive classifiers to achieve more balanced scores

## R3D: 一种结合成本敏感和不敏感分类器以实现更平衡分数的方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5391058/latest

Cost-sensitive classifiers have demonstrated to be more cost-effective than traditional classifiers in many real-world classification problems by avoiding high amounts of money loss. This is usually measured by a savings score. On the other hand, these classifiers present, in some cases, a reduction on conventional performance scores such as accuracy, f-score, precision and recall rates. Government applications are included in this segment of problems but, on public domains, the pursuit to the lowest cost is not an exclusive priority. In this light, this work proposes an approach which uses traditional and example-dependent cost-sensitive supervised learning in order to classify requests for revision of a Brazilian tax administration service. This hybrid approach has achieved a better trade-off when considering cost savings, accuracy, f-score, precision and recall in accordance to the business and data rules.

# Face Image-based Emotion Recognition using Fractal Dimension and Deep Convolutional Neural Network

## 基于分形维数和深度卷积神经网络的人脸图像情感识别

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5391946/latest

Face images are the primary non-verbal, face-to-face communication method used in criminal detection, depression analysis, mental disease identication, health forecasting, and other applications. As a result, there has been a lot of study on emotion recognition using face images in recent years. However, it remains a big challenge, especially when intra-class variations are high. A novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) on textured images is suggested in this work for solving the emotion recognition task. Firstly, the texture of original face images is measured by dierential box-counting-based fractal dimension to obtain low-level features. Secondly, the novel proposed DCNN framework explores facial landmarks as a form of a curve that produces distinct local facets to distinguish two expressions. The suggested DCNN combines features from many scales. This fusion of multi-scale features allows the proposed DCNN to gather more reliable and noise-resistant characteristics from an image's multiple portions. Furthermore, the proposed framework can preserve spatial and structural information and focus on describing details in local regions of the textured face images. Five publicly accessible benchmark databases, namely Extended Cohn-Kanade, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Real-World Aective Faces, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Facial Expression Recognition 2013, are considered in this work to compare the proposed method with some state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches based on four classication evaluation metrics: f1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision. Practical results exemplify that the proposed method defeats some SOTA approaches, proving its eectiveness for vision-based industrial systems such as autonomous driving, virtual reality, medical rehabilitation, etc.

## 多中心治疗前CT影像组学特征预测局部晚期食管癌根治性放化疗后局部复发

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5324347/latest

Purpose We constructed a prediction model to predict 2-year locoregional recurrence based on the clinical features and radiomics features extracted from machine learning method using computed tomography (CT) before definite chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) in locally advanced esophageal cancer.Patients and methods: A total of 264 patients (156 in Beijing, 87 in Tianjin, and 21 in Jiangsu) were included in this study. All those locally advanced esophogeal cancer patients received definite radiotherapy, and were randomly divided into 5 subgroups with similar number and divided into training group and validation group by five cross-validation. The esophageal tumor and extratumoral esophagus were segmented to extract radiomics features from the gross tumor volume (GTV) drawn by radiation therapists before radiotherapy, and 6 clinical features associated with prognosis were added. T stage, N stage, M stage, total stage, GTV and GTVnd volume were included to construct a prediction model to predict the 2-year locoregional recurrence of patients after definitive radiotherapy.Results 264 patients were enrolled from August 2012 to April 2018, with a median age of 62 years and 81% were males. The 2-year locoregional recurrence rate was 52.6%, and the 2-year overall survival rate was 45.6%. About 66% patients received concurrent chemotherapy. In total, we extracted 786 radiomics features from CT images and. the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was used to screen out the maximum 30 features. Finally the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was used to construct the integrated prediction model combining radiomics and clinical features. In the 5 training groups for predicting locoregional recurrence, the mean value of C-index was 0.9841 (95%CI, 0.9809&amp;ndash;0.9873), and in the 5 validation groups, the mean value was 0.744 (95%CI, 0.7437&amp;ndash;0.7443).Conclusion The prediction model could predict 2-year locoregional recurrence after radiotherapy. It can provide a foundation for searching for suitable treatment strategy for patients receiving definitive radiotherapy and guiding subsequent consolidation therapy.

# An end-to-end quantitative identification method for mining wire rope damage based on time series classification and deep learning

## 基于时间序列分类和深度学习的矿用钢丝绳损伤端到端定量识别方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5081764/latest

Mining wire rope (MWR) is an important part of mine hoisting equipment and plays a key role in mining operations. Damage to these ropes can significantly reduce production efficiency and pose serious safety risks to workers. Therefore, quantitatively identifying damage in MWR is of great importance. Traditional methods for damage signal identification rely on manual feature extraction (MFE), which depends heavily on experience and lacks stability and flexibility. This paper proposes an end-to-end (E2E) quantitative identification model for MWR damage based on time series classification (TSC) and deep learning (DL). Unlike traditional methods, the E2E model learns features directly from the one-dimensional raw signals of MWR damage and does not require MFE. In order to test its validity and versatility, experiments were conducted on three different datasets. The results show that the E2E method performs well in quantitatively identifying MWR damage compared to other methods and this method meets the requirements of the mining industry in terms of precision and efficiency to ensure safe and reliable operation of mining work.

# Machine learning-guided evolution of pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase for improved incorporation efficiency of diverse noncanonical amino acids

## 机器学习指导的吡咯赖氨酰-tRNA合成酶的进化，以提高多种非规范氨基酸的掺入效率

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5258661/latest

The pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNACUA pair is one of the most widely used systems for the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins at specific positions. Although directed evolution of PylRS have enabled over 300 ncAAs to be incorporated into proteins, most of the ncAA-containing proteins are expressed in a limited yield due to low activities of PylRS variants. Here, we applied machine learning (ML) to engineer the tRNA-binding domain of PylRS with a fast Fourier transform-partial least square regression (FFT-PLSR) model and three zero-shot prediction ML models. FFT-PLSR was first applied to explore a sequence space composed of pairwise combinations of 12 single mutations, and the best variant, Com1-IFRS, showed an 11-fold increase in activity compared to IFRS, a PylRS variant. The deep learning models ESM-1v, Mutcompute, and ProRefiner were then used to identify new mutation sites impacting the activity of Com1-IFRS. FFT-PLSR was used again to identify a variant, Com2-IFRS, from a sequence space containing 11520 mutations, which showed a 30-fold increase in activity. Com2-IFRS also enhanced enzyme activity against 12 other ncAAs by up to 3944.8-fold. Transplantation of the evolved mutations into 7 other PylRS-derived synthetases improved yields of proteins containing six types of ncAAs, including derivatives of Phe, Tyr, Trp, Cys, His and Lys, by up to 1149.7-fold. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that mutations reshaped the hydrogen bond network between tRNA and protein, which increased tRNA binding affinity, shortened the reaction distance between tRNA and ncAA, and even enhanced the dynamics correlation network. This paper offers new PylRS variants that increase the utility of the orthogonal translation system and provide a machine learning framework for identifying optimized multiple-point combinatorial mutations in a vast sequence space.

The correlations between students&amp;rsquo; autonomous motivation to perform the four learning activities and their perceived learning outcome in CPR are positive and significant.Conclusion This study provides empirical knowledge of the impact of four learning activities on students&amp;rsquo; autonomous motivation and their perceived learning outcome. Based on the results of this study, the use of a learning design containing preclass and in-class activities influences and supports nursing students&amp;rsquo; learning processes.

# Entity Matching with Quantum Neural Networks

## 基于量子神经网络的实体匹配

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5366343/latest

Modern technology and scientific experiments increasingly generate larger and larger amounts of data. This data is sometimesredundant, incomplete or inaccurate and needs to be cleaned and merged with other data before becoming useful for scientificexploration. Hence, entity matching, i.e. the process of linking data about a given entity gathered from multiple data sets, is amajor problem in artificial intelligence with applications in science and industry. Typical methods for entity matching either usespecialized algorithms or supervised machine learning. While the problem is well studied on classical computers, it is unclearhow quantum approaches would tackle these challenges. In this paper, we evaluate quantum machine learning algorithmsfor entity matching on a handcrafted data set and compare them to similar classical algorithms. We do this by implementinga neural network with a classical embedding layer and extending it with quantum layers. Our experimental results suggestthat our hybrid quantum neural network can improve the performance of some classical approaches while requiring fewerparameters than its classical counterpart. Furthermore, we also show that a model trained on a quantum simulator is portableand thus transferable to a real quantum computer.

# FedECA: A Federated External Control Arm Method for Causal Inference with Time-To-Event Data in Distributed Settings

## FedECA: 一种用于在分布式设置中使用事件时间数据进行因果推理的联合外部控制臂方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5346692/latest

External control arms (ECA) can inform the early clinical development of experimental drugs and provide efficacy evidence for regulatory approval. However, the main challenge in implementing ECA lies in accessing real-world or historical clinical trials data. Indeed, regulations protecting patients' rights by strictly controlling data processing make pooling data from multiple sources in a central server often difficult. To address these limitations, we develop a new method, 'FedECA' that leverages federated learning (FL) to enable inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for time-to-event outcomes on separate cohorts without needing to pool data. To showcase the potential of FedECA, we apply it in different settings of increasing complexity culminating with a real-world use-case in which FedECA provides evidence for a differential effect between two drugs that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. By sharing our code, we hope FedECA will foster the creation of federated research networks and thus accelerate drug development.

Terrestrial evaporation plays a crucial role in modulating climate and water resources. Here, we present a continuous, daily dataset covering 1980&ndash;2023 with a 0.1&deg; spatial resolution, produced using the fourth generation of the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). GLEAM4 embraces developments in hybrid modelling, learning evaporative stress from eddy- covariance and sapflow data. It features improved representation of key factors such as interception, atmospheric water demand, soil moisture, and plant access to groundwater. Estimates are inter-compared to existing global evaporation products and validated against in situ measurements, including data from 474 eddy-covariance sites, showing a median correlation of 0.73, root-mean-square error of 0.94 mm d&minus;1, and Kling&ndash;Gupta efficiency of 0.49. Global land evaporation is estimated at 71.2 x 103 km3 yr&minus;1, with 63% attributed to transpiration. Beyond actual evaporation and its components (transpiration, interception loss, soil evaporation, etc.), the dataset also provides soil moisture, potential evaporation, sensible heat flux, and evaporative stress, facilitating a wide range of hydrological, climatic, and ecological studies.

The term "Internet of Behaviors" (IoB) refers to the utilization of user behavior data to tailor experiences and interventions. It expands upon the Internet of Things (IoT) by incorporating technologies such as sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and data analytics for data collection and analysis. Deep Learning (DL)-based joint offloading and resource allocation show promise in improving IoB performance. However, there are still gaps to be addressed, such as developing more efficient algorithms to handle the computational demands of DL The problem of minimizing the weighted sum of task delay and energy consumption is addressed by constructing a smart factory model, and a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is formulated with this objective. This problem, acknowledged as non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard), leads to the selection of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach to tackle the objective function. To address these challenges, we present an IoB Task Offloading technique based on Double-Dueling DQN (D3QN) called ITOD3QN. To circumvent potential issues like the inaccurate estimation of Q-values in the Double DQN algorithm and the overestimation problem in the Dueling DQN algorithm, they are combined to propose the D3QN algorithm. When simulation results are considered, it is demonstrated that the ITOD3QN method showcases a significant improvement over three benchmarks in terms of reducing the total system cost when compared to baseline algorithms.

# Enhanced Chinese Mural Face Generation via FreqSplitAttention and Dual Mask Discriminator

## 通过freqsplit注意和双掩模鉴别器增强中国壁画人脸生成

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5393791/latest

As an important part of traditional art, Chinese murals embody rich historical and cultural connotations, especially the facial images, which reflect the political, cultural, and religious aspects of ancient society. However, the erosion caused by natural environments and human factors poses significant threats to the protection and inheritance of this cultural heritage. Therefore, the application of digital technology to protect mural faces is particularly urgent. Currently, the research on mural face digital generation faces numerous challenges, including the lack of standardized datasets, inadequate detail retention in generated images, inconsistent styles, and a tendency to overfit. These issues directly impact the effectiveness of mural face digitization. To address these challenges, we propose an improved StyleGAN2 generation architecture based on FreqSplitAttention. This method leverages Fourier transforms to separate high-frequency and low-frequency components of images, achieving simultaneous attention and optimization for both the global structure and local details of mural faces, thereby significantly enhancing the quality and structural consistency of the generated images. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic masking training strategy, employing a Dual Mask Discriminator (DMD) in both spatial and spectral domains to suppress the discriminator's shortcut learning, effectively alleviating overfitting issues during GAN training on limited datasets. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality digital Dunhuang mural face dataset named DMF containing 9552 images with a resolution of 256&amp;times;256. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in generating high-quality and diverse Chinese mural face images. On the DMF dataset, our model achieved the lowest FID score of 27.74, the lowest KID score of 10.22, and the highest IS score of 2.19, all outperforming existing state-of-the-art models. Our method not only preserves the cultural essence of traditional murals but also infuses them with new vitality, providing important theoretical and practical references for the digital preservation and cultural inheritance of murals. Additionally, the DMF dataset we constructed offers a valuable resource for the study of mural art.

# Artificial Feature Maps using Fractals: A New Data Augmentation Strategy for Deep Learning-based Whole-Slide Image Analysis

## 使用分形的人工特征图: 基于深度学习的全幻灯片图像分析的新数据增强策略

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5177100/latest

Background:A histopathological analysis of whole-slide images is essential for deep learning based cancer diagnosis. However, the large amount of annotated data required for training Deep Convolutional Networks (DCNs) is costly and time-consuming to obtain. This study proposes a novel method to artificially augment data for cancer classification using DCNs, aiming to address the challenges associated with limited annotated data.Methods:We introduce a novel approach that leverages prior knowledge of actual data to generate Artificial Class Activation Maps, using tissue-resembling fractals and assigning patch-level scores based on a known probability distribution. This method contrasts with existing approaches that rely on generative adversarial networks to create synthetic images. The proposed method was evaluated on real-world datasets of stomach cancer and validated on colorectal cancer whole-slide images.Results:The results demonstrate that adding artificially generated activation maps significantly enhances the performance of DCNs for whole-slide image classification. The most significant performance gains are observed in scenarios where the number of real maps is low. Notably, with only 25 real maps, adding 150 fractals boosts accuracy from 62.86% to 92.35%, and the Area Under the ROC Curve from 82.34% to 96.92%. This approach effectively reduces the dependence on real data and improves the generalization performance of deep convolutional networks.Conclusion:The proposed method provides a robust solution for accurate and efficient cancer classification in histopathology images, especially when annotated data is scarce. This advancement could lead to more reliable diagnostic tools in clinical settings where data availability is constrained.

# Monocular Depth Estimation for Vehicles with

## 车辆单目深度估计
在混合交通条件下安装摄像头

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5374429/latest

Depth estimation is crucial for computer vision applications like autonomous driving. While traditional methods such as LiDAR and radar are expensive, making monocular depth estimation a more cost-efficient alternative. However, deriving accurate depth from a single image is challenging due to its under-constrained nature. Monocular cues like perspective, scaling, and occlusion aid human depth perception, which deep learning-based models leverage to map image features to depth values. This research addresses the complexities of monocular depth estimation in mixed traffic conditions commonly found on Indian roads, with diverse vehicle classes, road surfaces, and unpredictable obstacles. Traditional methods often struggle in these scenarios. To overcome this, our study integrates object detection with deep learning models to estimate vehicle distances from frontal camera views. Validated using dashcam and drone footage, the proposed approach achieves an RMSE below 4 meters for both training and testing datasets. Moreover, the ensemble models reduced RMSE by up to 60% and improved the \(\textnormal{R}^\textnormal{2}\) value by 40%. This solution significantly enhances the spatial awareness of autonomous vehicles, providing a robust means of navigating heterogeneous traffic environments.
