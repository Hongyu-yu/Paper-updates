# Dissecting a Small Artificial Neural Network

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08341

**Authors:** Xiguang Yang, Krish Arora, Michael Bachmann

arXiv:2501.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the loss landscape and backpropagation dynamics of convergence for the simplest possible artificial neural network representing the logical exclusive-OR (XOR) gate. Cross-sections of the loss landscape in the nine-dimensional parameter space are found to exhibit distinct features, which help understand why backpropagation efficiently achieves convergence toward zero loss, whereas values of weights and biases keep drifting. Differences in shapes of cross-sections obtained by nonrandomized and randomized batches are discussed. In reference to statistical physics we introduce the microcanonical entropy as a unique quantity that allows to characterize the phase behavior of the network. Learning in neural networks can thus be thought of as an annealing process that experiences the analogue of phase transitions known from thermodynamic systems. It also reveals how the loss landscape simplifies as more hidden neurons are added to the network, eliminating entropic barriers caused by finite-size effects.

Abstract: Establishing viable solid-state synthesis pathways for novel inorganic materials remains a major challenge in materials science. Previous pathway design methods using pair-wise reaction approaches have navigated the thermodynamic landscape with first-principles data but lack kinetic information, limiting their effectiveness. This gap leads to suboptimal precursor selection and predictions, especially for reactions forming competing phases with similar formation energies, where ion diffusion is a critical influence. Here, we demonstrate an inorganic synthesis framework by incorporating machine learning-derived transport properties through "liquid-like" product layers into a thermodynamic cellular reaction model. In the Ba-Ti-O system, known for its competitive polymorphism, we obtain accurate predictions of phase formation with varying BaO:TiO2 ratios as a function of time and temperature. We find that diffusion-thermodynamic interplay governs phase compositions, with cross-ion transport coefficients critical for predicting diffusion-limited selectivity. This work bridges length and time scales by integrating solid-state reaction kinetics with first-principles thermodynamics and spatial reactivity.

# Towards Intelligent Active Particles

## 走向智能活性粒子

**Authors:** Hartmut L\"owen, Benno Liebchen

arXiv:2501.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this book chapter we describe recent applications of artificial intelligence and in particular machine learning to active matter systems. Active matter is composed of agents, or particles, that are capable of propelling themselves. While biological agents like bacteria, fish or birds naturally possess a certain degree of "intelligence", synthetic active particles like colloidal microswimmers and electronic robots can be equipped with different levels of artificial intelligence, either internally (as for robots) or via a dynamic external control system. This book chapter briefly discusses existing approaches to make synthetic particles increasingly "intelligent" and then focuses on the usage of machine learning to approach navigation and communication problems of active particles. Basic questions are how to steer a single active agent through a complex environment to reach or discover a target in an optimal way and how active particles need to cooperate to efficiently collect a distribution of targets (e.g. nutrients or toxins) from their complex environment.

arXiv:2501.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic structures of materials offer valuable insights into their functionality. Determining these structures remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for systems with defects. While both experimental and computational methods exist, each has limitations in resolving nanoscale structures. Core-level spectroscopies, such as x-ray absorption (XAS) or electron energy-loss spectroscopies (EELS), have been used to determine the local bonding environment and structure of materials. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been applied to extract structural and bonding information from XAS/EELS, but most of these frameworks rely on a single data stream, which is often insufficient. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating multimodal ab initio simulations, experimental data acquisition, and ML techniques for structure characterization. Our goal is to determine local structures and properties using EELS and XAS data from multiple elements and edges. To showcase our approach, we use various lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide compounds which are used for lithium ion batteries, including those with oxygen vacancies and antisite defects, as the sample material system. We successfully inferred local element content, ranging from lithium to transition metals, with quantitative agreement with experimental data. Beyond improving prediction accuracy, we find that ML model based on multimodal spectroscopic data is able to determine whether local defects such as oxygen vacancy and antisites are present, a task which is impossible for single mode spectra or other experimental techniques. Furthermore, our framework is able to provide physical interpretability, bridging spectroscopy with the local atomic and electronic structures.

Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.

# Predicting Performance of Object Detection Models in Electron Microscopy Using Random Forests

arXiv:2501.08465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying prediction uncertainty when applying object detection models to new, unlabeled datasets is critical in applied machine learning. This study introduces an approach to estimate the performance of deep learning-based object detection models for quantifying defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, focusing on detecting irradiation-induced cavities in TEM images of metal alloys. We developed a random forest regression model that predicts the object detection F1 score, a statistical metric used to evaluate the ability to accurately locate and classify objects of interest. The random forest model uses features extracted from the predictions of the object detection model whose uncertainty is being quantified, enabling fast prediction on new, unlabeled images. The mean absolute error (MAE) for predicting F1 of the trained model on test data is 0.09, and the $R^2$ score is 0.77, indicating there is a significant correlation between the random forest regression model predicted and true defect detection F1 scores. The approach is shown to be robust across three distinct TEM image datasets with varying imaging and material domains. Our approach enables users to estimate the reliability of a defect detection and segmentation model predictions and assess the applicability of the model to their specific datasets, providing valuable information about possible domain shifts and whether the model needs to be fine-tuned or trained on additional data to be maximally effective for the desired use case.

# Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians

## 迈向快速，专业的机器学习力场: 通过能量Hessians提取基础模型

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009

**Authors:** Ishan Amin, Sanjeev Raja, Aditi Krishnapriyan

arXiv:2501.09009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.

Abstract: Finding Minimum Energy Configurations (MECs) is essential in fields such as physics, chemistry, and materials science, as they represent the most stable states of the systems. In particular, identifying such MECs in multi-component alloys considered candidate PFMs is key because it determines the most stable arrangement of atoms within the alloy, directly influencing its phase stability, structural integrity, and thermo-mechanical properties. However, since the search space grows exponentially with the number of atoms considered, obtaining such MECs using computationally expensive first-principles DFT calculations often results in a cumbersome task. To escape the above compromise between physical fidelity and computational efficiency, we have developed a novel physics-based data-driven approach that combines Monte Carlo sampling, first-principles DFT calculations, and Machine Learning to accelerate the discovery of MECs in multi-component alloys. More specifically, we have leveraged well-established Cluster Expansion (CE) techniques with Local Outlier Factor models to establish strategies that enhance the reliability of the CE method. In this work, we demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed approach for the particular case of a tungsten-based quaternary high-entropy alloy. However, the method is applicable to other types of alloys and enables a wide range of applications.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.

Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.

arXiv:2409.13904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have been marked with the fast-pace diversification and increasing ubiquity of machine learning applications. Yet, a firm theoretical understanding of the surprising efficiency of neural networks to learn from high-dimensional data still proves largely elusive. In this endeavour, analyses inspired by statistical physics have proven instrumental, enabling the tight asymptotic characterization of the learning of neural networks in high dimensions, for a broad class of solvable models. This manuscript reviews the tools and ideas underlying recent progress in this line of work. We introduce a generic model -- the sequence multi-index model -- which encompasses numerous previously studied models as special instances. This unified framework covers a broad class of machine learning architectures with a finite number of hidden units, including multi-layer perceptrons, autoencoders, attention mechanisms; and tasks, including (un)supervised learning, denoising, contrastive learning, in the limit of large data dimension, and comparably large number of samples. We explicate in full detail the analysis of the learning of sequence multi-index models, using statistical physics techniques such as the replica method and approximate message-passing algorithms. This manuscript thus provides a unified presentation of analyses reported in several previous works, and a detailed overview of central techniques in the field of statistical physics of machine learning. This review should be a useful primer for machine learning theoreticians curious of statistical physics approaches; it should also be of value to statistical physicists interested in the transfer of such ideas to the study of neural networks.

Abstract: In current electronic structure research endeavors such as warm dense matter or machine learning applications, efficient development necessitates non-monolithic software, providing an extendable and flexible interface. The open-source idea offers the advantage of having a source code base that can be reviewed and modified by the community. However, practical implementations can often diverge significantly from their theoretical counterpart. Leveraging the efforts of recent theoretical formulations and the features of Python, we try to mitigate these problems. We present eminus, an education- and development-friendly electronic structure package designed for convenient and customizable workflows, yet built with intelligible and modular implementations.

**Authors:** Joseph P. Molnar, Jiangnan Xia, Rui Zhang, Samuel J. Grauer, Chang Liu

arXiv:2501.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel neural-implicit approach to laser absorption tomography (LAT) with experimental verification. A coordinate neural network is used to represent thermochemical state variables as continuous functions of space and time. Unlike most existing neural methods for LAT, which rely on prior simulations and supervised training, our approach is based solely on LAT measurements, utilizing a differentiable observation operator with line parameters provided in standard spectroscopy database formats. Although reconstructing scalar fields from multi-beam absorbance data is an inherently ill-posed, nonlinear inverse problem, our continuous space-time parameterization supports physics-inspired regularization strategies and enables physics-informed data assimilation. Synthetic and experimental tests are conducted to validate the method, demonstrating robust performance and reproducibility. We show that our neural-implicit approach to LAT can capture the dominant spatial modes of an unsteady flame from very sparse measurement data, indicating its potential to reveal combustion instabilities in measurement domains with minimal optical access.

# Operator Learning for Reconstructing Flow Fields from Sparse Measurements: an Energy Transformer Approach

**Authors:** Qian Zhang, Dmitry Krotov, George Em Karniadakis

arXiv:2501.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods have shown great success in various scientific areas, including fluid mechanics. However, reconstruction problems, where full velocity fields must be recovered from partial observations, remain challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel operator learning framework for solving reconstruction problems by using the Energy Transformer (ET), an architecture inspired by associative memory models. We formulate reconstruction as a mapping from incomplete observed data to full reconstructed fields. The method is validated on three fluid mechanics examples using diverse types of data: (1) unsteady 2D vortex street in flow past a cylinder using simulation data; (2) high-speed under-expanded impinging supersonic jets impingement using Schlieren imaging; and (3) 3D turbulent jet flow using particle tracking. The results demonstrate the ability of ET to accurately reconstruct complex flow fields from highly incomplete data (90\% missing), even for noisy experimental measurements, with fast training and inference on a single GPU. This work provides a promising new direction for tackling reconstruction problems in fluid mechanics and other areas in mechanics, geophysics, weather prediction, and beyond.

Abstract: Data-driven convective parameterization aims to accurately represent convective adjustments to large-scale forcings in a computationally economic manner. While previous studies have demonstrated success using various model architectures, challenges persist in developing physically interpretable models and assessing generalizability and confidence level. In this study, we develop a recurrent neural network to predict time series of temperature, moisture, and precipitation of a cumulus ensemble in response to large-scale forcings. The recurrent cell combines a linear component, pre-identified as a time-invariant state-space model within the linear limit of the problem, and a multilayer neural network for the nonlinear component. Trained on ensembles of limited-domain cloud-resolving model simulation data, the model exhibits stable and realistic performance in long-term emulations, both with prescribed large-scale forcings and when coupled with two-dimensional gravity waves. We further calculate linear responses to perturbations for the coupled emulation, revealing physically interpretable, state-dependent properties of the convectively coupled gravity wave system.

Abstract: Remote sensing observations and Mars rover missions have recorded the presence of beaches, salt lakes, and wind erosion landforms in Martian sediments. All these observations indicate that Mars was hydrated in its early history. There used to be oceans on Mars, but they have now dried up. Therefore, signs of previous life on Mars could be preserved in the evaporites formed during this process. The study of evaporite regions has thus become a priority area for Mars' life exploration. This study proposes a method for training similarity metrics from surface land image data of Earth and Mars, which can be used for recognition or validation applications. The method will be applied in simulating tasks to select Mars landing sites using a selecting small-scale area of the Mars analaogue the evaporite region of Qaidam Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This learning process minimizes discriminative loss function, which makes the similarity measure smaller for images from the same location and larger for images from different locations. This study selected a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based model, which has been trained to explain various changes in image appearance and identify different landforms in Mars. By identifying different landforms, priority landing sites on Mars can be selected.

arXiv:2501.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical time integration is fundamental to the simulation of initial and boundary value problems. Traditionally, time integration schemes require adaptive time-stepping to ensure computational speed and sufficient accuracy. Although these methods are based on mathematical derivations related to the order of accuracy for the chosen integrator, they also rely on heuristic development to determine optimal time steps. In this work, we use an alternative approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to select the optimal time step for any time integrator method, balancing computational speed and accuracy. To explore the potential of our RL-based adaptive time-stepping approach, we choose a challenging model problem involving set-valued frictional instabilities at various spatiotemporal scales. This problem demonstrates the robustness of our strategy in handling nonsmooth problems, which present a demanding scenario for numerical integration. Specifically, we apply RL to the simulation of a seismic fault with Coulomb friction. Our findings indicate that RL can learn an optimal strategy for time integration, achieving up to a fourfold speed-up. Our RL-based adaptive integrator offers a new approach for time integration in various other problems in mechanics.

Abstract: Angular streaking experiments enable for experimentation in the attosecond regions. However, the deployed Time-of-flight detectors are susceptible to noise and failure. These shortcomings make the outputs of the Time-of-flight detectors hard to understand for humans and further processing, such as for example the extraction of beam properties. In this article, we present an approach to remove high noise levels and reconstruct up to three failed Time-of-flight detectors from an arrangement of 16 Time-of-flight detectors. Due to its fast evaluation time, the presented method is applicable online during a running experiment. It is trained with simulation data, and we show the results of denoising and reconstruction of our method on real-world experiment data.

Abstract: The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.

Abstract: We investigate the loss landscape and backpropagation dynamics of convergence for the simplest possible artificial neural network representing the logical exclusive-OR (XOR) gate. Cross-sections of the loss landscape in the nine-dimensional parameter space are found to exhibit distinct features, which help understand why backpropagation efficiently achieves convergence toward zero loss, whereas values of weights and biases keep drifting. Differences in shapes of cross-sections obtained by nonrandomized and randomized batches are discussed. In reference to statistical physics we introduce the microcanonical entropy as a unique quantity that allows to characterize the phase behavior of the network. Learning in neural networks can thus be thought of as an annealing process that experiences the analogue of phase transitions known from thermodynamic systems. It also reveals how the loss landscape simplifies as more hidden neurons are added to the network, eliminating entropic barriers caused by finite-size effects.

# Physics-informed neural networks for phase-resolved data assimilation and prediction of nonlinear ocean waves

Abstract: The assimilation and prediction of phase-resolved surface gravity waves are critical challenges in ocean science and engineering. Potential flow theory (PFT) has been widely employed to develop wave models and numerical techniques for wave prediction. However, traditional wave prediction methods are often limited. For example, most simplified wave models have a limited ability to capture strong wave nonlinearity, while fully nonlinear PFT solvers often fail to meet the speed requirements of engineering applications. This computational inefficiency also hinders the development of effective data assimilation techniques, which are required to reconstruct spatial wave information from sparse measurements to initialize the wave prediction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel solver method that leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that parameterize PFT solutions as neural networks. This provides a computationally inexpensive way to assimilate and predict wave data. The proposed PINN framework is validated through comparisons with analytical linear PFT solutions and experimental data collected in a laboratory wave flume. The results demonstrate that our approach accurately captures and predicts irregular, nonlinear, and dispersive wave surface dynamics. Moreover, the PINN can infer the fully nonlinear velocity potential throughout the entire fluid volume solely from surface elevation measurements, enabling the calculation of fluid velocities that are difficult to measure experimentally.

Abstract: Establishing viable solid-state synthesis pathways for novel inorganic materials remains a major challenge in materials science. Previous pathway design methods using pair-wise reaction approaches have navigated the thermodynamic landscape with first-principles data but lack kinetic information, limiting their effectiveness. This gap leads to suboptimal precursor selection and predictions, especially for reactions forming competing phases with similar formation energies, where ion diffusion is a critical influence. Here, we demonstrate an inorganic synthesis framework by incorporating machine learning-derived transport properties through "liquid-like" product layers into a thermodynamic cellular reaction model. In the Ba-Ti-O system, known for its competitive polymorphism, we obtain accurate predictions of phase formation with varying BaO:TiO2 ratios as a function of time and temperature. We find that diffusion-thermodynamic interplay governs phase compositions, with cross-ion transport coefficients critical for predicting diffusion-limited selectivity. This work bridges length and time scales by integrating solid-state reaction kinetics with first-principles thermodynamics and spatial reactivity.

**Authors:** Hartmut L\"owen, Benno Liebchen

arXiv:2501.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this book chapter we describe recent applications of artificial intelligence and in particular machine learning to active matter systems. Active matter is composed of agents, or particles, that are capable of propelling themselves. While biological agents like bacteria, fish or birds naturally possess a certain degree of "intelligence", synthetic active particles like colloidal microswimmers and electronic robots can be equipped with different levels of artificial intelligence, either internally (as for robots) or via a dynamic external control system. This book chapter briefly discusses existing approaches to make synthetic particles increasingly "intelligent" and then focuses on the usage of machine learning to approach navigation and communication problems of active particles. Basic questions are how to steer a single active agent through a complex environment to reach or discover a target in an optimal way and how active particles need to cooperate to efficiently collect a distribution of targets (e.g. nutrients or toxins) from their complex environment.

arXiv:2501.08738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel masked pre-training technique for graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems. By randomly masking up to 40\% of input mesh nodes during pre-training, we force the model to learn robust representations of complex fluid dynamics. We pair this masking strategy with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and gated multi-layer perceptrons to further enhance performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on seven CFD datasets, including a new challenging dataset of 3D intracranial aneurysm simulations with over 250,000 nodes per mesh. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and training efficiency across such diverse range of fluid simulation tasks. We demonstrate improvements of up to 60\% in long-term prediction accuracy compared to previous best models, while maintaining similar computational costs. Notably, our approach enables effective pre-training on multiple datasets simultaneously, significantly reducing the time and data required to achieve high performance on new tasks. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide insights into the optimal masking ratio, architectural choices, and training strategies.

Abstract: Atomistic structures of materials offer valuable insights into their functionality. Determining these structures remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for systems with defects. While both experimental and computational methods exist, each has limitations in resolving nanoscale structures. Core-level spectroscopies, such as x-ray absorption (XAS) or electron energy-loss spectroscopies (EELS), have been used to determine the local bonding environment and structure of materials. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been applied to extract structural and bonding information from XAS/EELS, but most of these frameworks rely on a single data stream, which is often insufficient. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating multimodal ab initio simulations, experimental data acquisition, and ML techniques for structure characterization. Our goal is to determine local structures and properties using EELS and XAS data from multiple elements and edges. To showcase our approach, we use various lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide compounds which are used for lithium ion batteries, including those with oxygen vacancies and antisite defects, as the sample material system. We successfully inferred local element content, ranging from lithium to transition metals, with quantitative agreement with experimental data. Beyond improving prediction accuracy, we find that ML model based on multimodal spectroscopic data is able to determine whether local defects such as oxygen vacancy and antisites are present, a task which is impossible for single mode spectra or other experimental techniques. Furthermore, our framework is able to provide physical interpretability, bridging spectroscopy with the local atomic and electronic structures.

Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.

Abstract: Seismic data frequently exhibits missing traces, substantially affecting subsequent seismic processing and interpretation. Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in reconstructing irregularly missing seismic data through supervised and unsupervised methods. Nonetheless, substantial challenges remain, such as generalization capacity and computation time cost during the inference. Our work introduces a reconstruction method that uses a pre-trained generative diffusion model for image synthesis and incorporates Deep Image Prior to enforce data consistency when reconstructing missing traces in seismic data. The proposed method has demonstrated strong robustness and high reconstruction capability of post-stack and pre-stack data with different levels of structural complexity, even in field and synthetic scenarios where test data were outside the training domain. This indicates that our method can handle the high geological variability of different exploration targets. Additionally, compared to other state-of-the-art seismic reconstruction methods using diffusion models. During inference, our approach reduces the number of sampling timesteps by up to 4x.

Abstract: The design of fusion devices is typically based on computationally expensive simulations. This can be alleviated using high aspect ratio models that employ a reduced number of free parameters, especially in the case of stellarator optimization where non-axisymmetric magnetic fields with a large parameter space are optimized to satisfy certain performance criteria. However, optimization is still required to find configurations with properties such as low elongation, high rotational transform, finite plasma beta, and good fast particle confinement. In this work, we train a machine learning model to construct configurations with favorable confinement properties by finding a solution to the inverse design problem, that is, obtaining a set of model input parameters for given desired properties. Since the solution of the inverse problem is non-unique, a probabilistic approach, based on mixture density networks, is used. It is shown that optimized configurations can be generated reliably using this method.

Leveraging the efforts of recent theoretical formulations and the features of Python, we try to mitigate these problems. We present eminus, an education- and development-friendly electronic structure package designed for convenient and customizable workflows, yet built with intelligible and modular implementations.

Abstract: The advancement of high-performance computing has enabled the generation of large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of turbulent flows, driving the need for efficient compression/decompression techniques that reduce storage demands while maintaining fidelity. Traditional methods, such as the discrete wavelet transform, cannot achieve compression ratios of 8 or higher for complex turbulent flows without introducing significant encoding/decoding errors. On the other hand, a super-resolution-based generative adversarial network (SR-GAN), called ZipGAN, can accurately reconstruct fine-scale features, preserving velocity gradients and structural details, even at a compression ratio of 512, thanks to the more efficient representation of the data in compact latent space. Additional benefits are ascribed to adversarial training. The high GAN training time is significantly reduced with a progressive transfer learning approach and, once trained, they can be applied independently of the Reynolds number. It is demonstrated that ZipGAN can enhance dataset temporal resolution without additional simulation overhead by generating high-quality intermediate fields from compressed snapshots. The ZipGAN discriminator can reliably evaluate the quality of decoded fields, ensuring fidelity even in the absence of original DNS fields. Hence, ZipGAN compression/decompression method presents a highly efficient and scalable alternative for large-scale DNS storage and transfer, offering substantial advantages over the DWT methods in terms of compression efficiency, reconstruction fidelity, and temporal resolution enhancement.

Abstract: Modeling atmospheric chemistry is complex and computationally intense. Given the recent success of Deep neural networks in digital signal processing, we propose a Neural Network Emulator for fast chemical concentration modeling. We consider atmospheric chemistry as a time-dependent Ordinary Differential Equation. To extract the hidden correlations between initial states and future time evolution, we propose ChemNNE, an Attention based Neural Network Emulator (NNE) that can model the atmospheric chemistry as a neural ODE process. To efficiently simulate the chemical changes, we propose the sinusoidal time embedding to estimate the oscillating tendency over time. More importantly, we use the Fourier neural operator to model the ODE process for efficient computation. We also propose three physical-informed losses to supervise the training optimization. To evaluate our model, we propose a large-scale chemical dataset that can be used for neural network training and evaluation. The extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling accuracy and computational speed.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.

# Surface Induced Unfolding Reveals Unique Structural Features and Enhances Machine Learning Classification Models

**Authors:** Rowan, Matney

Native ion mobility-mass spectrometry combined with collision-induced unfolding (CIU) is a powerful analytical method for protein characterization, offering insights into structural stability, and enabling the differentiation of analytes of similar mass and mobility. A surface induced dissociation (SID) device was recently commercialized, enabling broader adoption of SID measurements and surface induced folding (SIU). This study evaluates SIU, benchmarking its reproducibility and performance against CIU on a Waters CyclicIMS ion mobility-mass spectrometer. Reproducibility studies were conducted on model proteins, including β-lactoglobulin (β-lac), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ). SIU and CIU exhibited comparable reproducibility, with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values averaging less than 4% across multiple charge states. Notably, SIU achieved unfolding transitions at lower activation thresholds, enhancing sensitivity to subtle structural differences and providing additional analytical information content such as unique high arrival time unfolding features and additional unfolding transitions. Furthermore, the differentiation of closely related protein subclasses, such as IgG1κ and IgG4κ, was improved with SIU, as evidenced by higher RMSD pair-wise comparisons and the identification of unique unfolding intermediates. These advancements translated into enhanced supervised machine learning models for IgG subclass classifications. SIU-trained models outperformed or matched CIU-trained models, achieving high cross-validation accuracies (>90%) and robust classifications of biotherapeutics Adalimumab and Nivolumab. This work establishes SIU as a complementary and efficient alternative to CIU, offering improved sensitivity, and analytical depth without loss in reproducibility. This work highlights the benefits of including SIU in protein characterization workflows, particularly in high-throughput and machine learning-guided applications.

**Authors:** Anders, Niklasson

We present an extended Lagrangian shadow molecular dynamics scheme with an interatomic Born-Oppenheimer potential determined by the relaxed atomic charges of a second-order charge equilibration model. To parameterize the charge equilibration model, we use machine learning with neural networks to determine the environment-dependent electronegativities and chemical hardness parameters for each atom, in addition to the charge-independent energy and force terms. The approximate shadow molecular dynamics potential in combination with the extended Lagrangian formulation improves the numerical stability and reduces the number of Coulomb potential calculations required to evaluate accurate conservative forces. We demonstrate efficient and accurate simulations with excellent long-term stability of the molecular dynamics trajectories. The significance of the choosing fixed or environment-dependent electronegativities and chemical hardness parameters is evaluated.  Finally, we compute the infrared spectrum of molecules via the dipole auto-correlation function and compare to experiments to highlight the accuracy of the shadow molecular dynamics scheme with a machine learned flexible charge potential.

**Authors:** Kari, Laasonen

The water solubility of organic molecules is critical for optimizing the performance and stability of aqueous flow batteries, as well as for various other applications. Although relatively straightforward to measure in some cases, the theoretical prediction of the solubility remains a considerable challenge. To this end, machine learning algorithms have become increasingly important tools in the past decade. High-quality data and effective descriptors are essential for constructing reliable data-driven estimation models. We systematically investigate the effectiveness of enhanced structure-based descriptors and an outlier detection procedure for improving aqueous solubility predictability. We train and evaluate random forest regression models using various descriptors to predict experimental solubility. Outliers are identified through an iterative maximum-error deletion procedure. We discover that descriptors derived from hydration free energy and weighted fingerprints, along with other established features, are effective. Notably, solvation energy, octanol-water partition coefficient, atomic charge polarizability interactions, and the presence of a full-carbon aromatic ring are critical for solubility prediction. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the outlier detection protocol is validated by improving the performance of the model and detailed analysis of the dataset. This study significantly improves the predictive capacity of supervised machine learning for molecular properties, enabling advancements in various technological applications.

**Authors:** Hadrian, Montes-Campos

Protic ionic liquids, PILs, are promising materials for energy storage applications, in part due to their ability to decouple proton transport from ion diffusion. In this work, the proton transfer mechanism in 1-ethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([HEIM][TFSI]) IL was studied by means of three different computational approaches.  Classical polarizable molecular dynamics simulations were used to explore the structure and dynamics of the fully ionized system, while Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out to estimate the energy barriers for the different proton transfer reactions. Finally, the proton transfer was explicitly studied by means of Neural Network Force Field simulations. Our results show that this reaction is indeed possible when doping the IL with an excess of deprotonated cations, and highlight the importance of the formation of dimers between donor and acceptor species for the proton transfer to occur. The main driving factor for the reaction was found to be the energy cost for reaching a suitable coordination environment and form such dimers, which is higher than that for the transfer reaction.

**Authors:** Philippe, Schambel

DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) enable efficient experimental screening of vast combinatorial molecular libraries, making it a powerful platform for drug discovery. Apart from ensuring the druglike physicochemical properties, other key parameters to maximize the success rate of DEL designs include the scaffold diversity and target addressability. While several computational tools have been developed to evaluate DEL chemical diversity, a dedicated tool that combines both parameters is currently lacking. In this work, we developed a computational approach to systematically evaluate both the scaffold diversity and target-orientedness of DELs using Bemis-Murcko (BM) scaffold analysis and machine learning. To demonstrate its utility, we present a case study using two of our in-house produced libraries. We show that our workflow can effectively distinguish between a generalist and a focused library. Furthermore, we show that although focused libraries tend to have higher compound-based addressability, they could suffer from lower scaffold-based addressability relative to a generalist library. Consequently, we illustrate how our tool can guide medicinal chemists in deciding which library to screen as a function of the objective, whether it is hit-finding or hit-optimization. To facilitate utilization, this tool is freely available both as a web application and as a Python script at https://github.com/novalixofficial/NovaWebApp.

**Authors:** Shihao, Ding

In nature, enzymes leverage constituent amino acid residues to create catalytic microenvironment for their active sites to effect high reactivity and selectivity. Multicomponent host−guest assemblies have been exploited to mimic enzymatic microenvironments by preorganizing a network of noncovalent interactions. While anion-binding catalysts such as thioureas have gained widespread success in organic transformation and controlled polymerization, evaluation of the participating structural features in the transition state (TS) stabilization remains challenging. Herein, we report the use of data science tools, i.e., a decision-tree-based machine-learning algorithm and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis, to model reactivity and regioselectivity in a thiourea-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of 1,2-dithiolanes. Variation of aryl substituent position and electronic characteristics helps reveal key catalyst features involved in the TS stabilization within the catalytically active, multicomponent host−guest complexes. The analysis of feature importance helps explain the reason behind the optimal performance of (pseudo)halogen-substituted catalysts. Furthermore, the structural basis for the unveiled reactivity-regioselectivity trade-off in the catalysis are established.

# Screen Necroptosis-related Genes and evaluate the prognostic capacity, clinical value and the affection of their copy number variations in acute myeloid leukemia

## 程序性坏死相关基因的筛选及其对急性髓系白血病的预后能力、临床价值和拷贝数变异的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4313518/latest

Background：Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological neoplasm. Little improvement in survival rates has been achieved over the past few decades. Necroptosis has relationship with certain types of malignancies outcomes. Here, we evaluated the diagnostic ability, prognostic capacity of necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) and the affection of their copy number variations (CNVs) in AML.
Methods：Necroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (NRDEGs) were acquired after intersecting Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) database with NRGs from GeneCards, Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB) and literatures. Machine learning was applied to obtain hub-NRDEGs. The expression levels of 6 hub-NRDEGs were validated in vitro. mRNA-miRNA and mRNA-TF interaction networks with hub-NRDEGs were screened by Cytoscape@. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was utilized to calculate correlationships between hub-NRDEGs and immune cells. CNVs analysis on hub-NRDEGs was carried out based on TCGA-LAML datasets from the TCGA database. Kaplan&ndash;Meier(K-M) survival analyses was utilized to evaluate the prognostic values along with COX model.
Results：6 hub-NRDEGs (SLC25A5, PARP1, CTSS, ZNF217, NFKB1, PYGL) were obtained and their expression changes derived from CNVs in AML were visualized. 65 mRNA-miRNA and 80 mRNA-TF interaction networks with hub-NRDEGs was screened. ssGSEA result showed the expression of RAPR1 is inversely related with CD56dim natural killer cell and CTSS positive with MDSCs in AML. K-M results demonstrated ZNF217 had significant difference in duration of survival in AML patients. Cox regression models revealed hub-NRDEGs had better predictive power at year-1 and year-5.
Conclusion： These screened NRDEGs could be exploited as clinical prognosis predictions in AML patients, as well as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic targeting.

# Assessment of Medical Foundation Models for Survival Prediction with Whole Slide Images

## 用全载玻片图像评估用于生存预测的医学基础模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5832726/latest

Survival prediction with whole slide images (WSIs) can provide guidance for a better patient care and treatment selection but it is a challenging computer vision task with its particularities. Despite the great results showed by the recent survival analysis models with WSIs, the collection of the large annotated WSI datasets for survival analysis could be hindered by disease rareness or clinical trials constraints and be infeasible in the real-life medical practice. To overcome these limitations we propose to assess the performance of the digital pathology foundation models for prediction of survival outcomes on the small size ovarian cancer datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that these models show promising results, their improved performance open the possibility to investigate the mechanisms of response to a particular therapy and in general could accelerate the adoption of machine learning models in medical practice.

This study aims to develop a new efficient neural network called Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy elliptic type-2 cerebellar model articulation controller (TSKFET2C) using improved particle swarm optimization for nonlinear systems. For identification and prediction problems, the TSKFET2C is used as the main identifier and the main predictor, respectively. The learning laws for the system parameters are established for all rules of the proposed structure based on the gradient descent algorithm and the minimization of the cost function. For the control problem, the TSKFET2C is used as the main controller and an auxiliary controller is used to eliminate the residual error. The stability of the control system is guaranteed by Lyapunov theory. Moreover, an improved particle swarm optimization is employed to achieve optimal learning rates for updating the parameters of the TSKFET2C. Finally, the proposed TSKFET2C is applied to three types of nonlinear systems to illustrate its performance and effectiveness.

This paper aims to develop a new efficient multilayer neural network structure by combining the elliptic type-2 membership function with a Takagi- Sugenno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system and a cerebellar model articulation controller to create a new multilayer TSK elliptic type-2 fuzzy cerebellar-imitated neural network (MTET2FCNN). The MTET2FCNN can be used as the main controller in the control problem, and it is also respectively used as the main identifier and predictor for identification and prediction problems. In addition, a modified Grey-Wolf optimization algorithm is used to update the optimal learning rates of the MTET2FCNN structure. System parameter learning is performed for all rules of the proposed MTET2FCNN structure based on the gradient descent algorithm and cost function minimization. The robust design of the compensator and the system's stability are proved by Lyapunov theory. The synchronization of a chaotic 4D Rabinovich system, the identification of a time-varying system, and a Mackey-Glass time series prediction demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed system.

# Automatic Assistance to Mitigate Rollback Inconsistencies in Collaborative Edits

## 自动协助减轻协作编辑中的回滚不一致

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5830055/latest

The success of technical Q&amp;amp;A sites such as Stack Overflow depends on two key factors: (a) active user participation and (b) the quality of the shared knowledge. Stack Overflow introduced an edit system that allows users to suggest improvements to posts (i.e., questions and answers) to enhance the quality of the content. However, users, such as post owners or site moderators, can reject these suggested edits by rollbacks due to unsatisfactory, low-quality edits or violating edit guidelines. Unfortunately, subjectivity bias in determining whether an edit is satisfactory or unsatisfactory can lead to inconsistencies in the rollback decisions. For example, one user might accept the formatting of a method name (e.g., getActivity()) as a code term, while another might reject it. Such inconsistencies can demotivate and frustrate users whose edits are rejected. Furthermore, several post owners prefer to keep their content unchanged and even resist necessary edits. As a result, they sometimes roll back necessary edits and revert posts to a flawed version, which violates editing guidelines. The problems mentioned above are further compounded by the lack of specific guidelines and tools to assist users in ensuring consistency in user rollback actions. In this study, we investigate the types, prevalence, and impact of rollback edit inconsistencies and propose a solution to address them. The outcomes of this research are fivefold. First, we manually investigated 764 rollback edits (382 questions + 382 answers) and identified eight types of inconsistent rollback. Second, we surveyed 44 practitioners to assess the impact of rollback inconsistencies. More than 80% of the participants found our identified inconsistency types detrimental to post quality. Third, we developed rule-based algorithms and Machine Learning (ML) models to detect the eight types of rollback inconsistencies. Both approaches achieve over 90% accuracy. Fourth, we introduced a tool, iEdit, which integrates these algorithms into a browser extension and assists Stack Overflow users during their edits. Fifth, we surveyed 16 Stack Overflow users to evaluate the effectiveness of iEdit. The participants found the tool&rsquo;s suggestions helpful in avoiding inconsistent rollback edits.

# Survival Rate Prediction in glioblastoma Patients Using Machine learning

## 使用机器学习预测胶质母细胞瘤患者的生存率

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5765031/latest

Glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, continues to pose significant challenges, with median survival rates ranging&nbsp;from 12 to 18 months despite ongoing advances in treatment. Traditional survival prediction models predominantly rely on&nbsp;non-omic data, such as MRI, PET, and CT scans, which often lack the granularity to uncover molecular biomarkers crucial&nbsp;for guiding personalized therapeutic strategies. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology focused solely on omic data&nbsp;for survival prediction in glioblastoma patients. Our approach integrates genomic features, including G-CIMP methylation,&nbsp;gene expression subtypes, and IDH1 mutation. Utilizing a robust dataset comprising 577 patient records and 22 features, we&nbsp;implement a deep learning model based on Transformer architecture. The model incorporates positional encoding to capture&nbsp;complex temporal relationships in survival data and leverages the Cox proportional hazards framework for survival analysis.
Our results demonstrate a high concordance index (C-index) of 87% and an integrated Brier score (IBS) of 0.05 that further
validates the model&rsquo;s predictive accuracy. We highlight the influence of critical genomic features on survival predictions. This&nbsp;approach represents a significant advancement in leveraging omic data and modern machine learning techniques to enhance&nbsp;the accuracy and reliability of glioblastoma prognosis, offering promising implications for personalized treatment strategies and&nbsp;improved patient outcomes.

# Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Management Prediction Through Machine Learning Models: An Ensemble Tree Regressor Analysis

## 通过机器学习模型预测城市固体废物 (MSW) 管理: 集成树回归分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5834340/latest

MSW management is one of the critical global challenges, especially in the context of rapid urbanization and economic development. This study examines the factors that influence MSW generation and the potential of machine learning techniques to predict future trends. Using a dataset covering 196 countries and 13 regions, we analyze key variables such as population, GDP per capita, urbanization rate, and Human Development Index (HDI). In preprocessing, missing values were managed and new features like MSW and population growth rates, waste intensity, and HDI-adjusted waste were engineered to capture the complex relationships influencing MSW generation. An Extra Trees Regressor model was used for future prediction, achieving an R&amp;sup2; value of 0.89, thereby proving its excellent performance in predictive results. Our results demonstrate how economic development and urbanization contribute to waste generation trends, with the AI models further providing insightful implications of such changes. The need for data-informed approaches for designing sustainable systems of waste management is underscored by this study, highlighting that socio-economic drivers and technological leaps must be used in concert with each other in order to adequately address the challenges of increasing wastes. The findings offer a basis for future policies and actions that would aim at managing waste effectively in an increasingly urbanized world.

# An Automated Multimodal Medical Image Fusion Framework for Alzheimer Detection using Deep Learning

## 基于深度学习的自动多模态医学图像融合框架，用于阿尔茨海默病检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5826078/latest

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that affects the elderly population. The early detection and diagnosis of AD is critical for achieving effective treatment, as it can greatly improve the patient experience. AD can be viewed through imaging techniques like MRI, PET, and SPECT, providing valuable information about structural and functional changes. These findings are important in understanding this area. However, each imaging modality offers a different perspective. This information can be better collected from several of the other modalities as well as from some others to improve accuracy and reliability in AD detection. By combining information from different imaging modalities, such as MRI, PET, DTI, and fMRI, automated multimodal medical image frameworks aim to create a fused representation that preserves the relevant features from each modality. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), among other deep learning techniques, have been prevalent in these frameworks for learning discriminative and informative features from multi-modal data. In this paper, The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is used for experimental analysis. The proposed work gives 98.94% of accuracy and 1.06% of error which is greater than the existing approaches.
