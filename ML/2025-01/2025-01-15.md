# Hierarchy-Boosted Funnel Learning for Identifying Semiconductors with Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity

## 用于识别具有超低晶格热导率的半导体的层次增强漏斗学习

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06775

**Authors:** Mengfan Wu, Shenshen Yan, Jie Ren

arXiv:2501.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) has demonstrated tremendous potential in material property predictions. However, the scarcity of materials data with costly property labels in the vast chemical space presents a significant challenge for ML in efficiently predicting properties and uncovering structure-property relationships. Here, we propose a novel hierarchy-boosted funnel learning (HiBoFL) framework, which is successfully applied to identify semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_\mathrm{L}$). By training on only a few hundred materials targeted by unsupervised learning from a pool of hundreds of thousands, we achieve efficient and interpretable supervised predictions of ultralow $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$, thereby circumventing large-scale brute-force calculations without clear objectives. As a result, we provide a list of candidates with ultralow $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$ for potential thermoelectric applications and discover a new factor that significantly influences structural anharmonicity. This study offers a novel practical pathway for accelerating the discovery of functional materials.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly normalizing flows, have shown exceptional performance in learning probability distributions across various domains of physics, including statistical mechanics, collider physics, and lattice field theory. In the context of lattice field theory, normalizing flows have been successfully applied to accurately learn the Boltzmann distribution, enabling a range of tasks such as direct estimation of thermodynamic observables and sampling independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) configurations.
  In this work, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration that normalizing flows can be used to learn the Boltzmann distribution for the Hubbard model. This model is widely employed to study the electronic structure of graphene and other carbon nanomaterials. State-of-the-art numerical simulations of the Hubbard model, such as those based on Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) methods, often suffer from ergodicity issues, potentially leading to biased estimates of physical observables. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that leveraging i.i.d.\ sampling from the normalizing flow effectively addresses these issues.

**Authors:** Omar Abou El Kheir, Marco Bernasconi

arXiv:2501.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change materials are exploited in several enabling technologies such as storage class memories, neuromorphic devices and memories embedded in microcontrollers. A key functional property for these applications is the fast crystal nucleation and growth in the supercool liquid phase. Over the last decade, atomistic simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial insights on the early stage of this process. These simulations are, however, restricted to a few hundred atoms for at most a few ns. More recently, the scope of the DFT simulations have been greatly extended by leveraging on machine learning techniques. In this paper, we show that the exploitation of a recently devised neural network potential for the prototypical phase change compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$, allows simulating the crystallization process in a multimillion atom model at the length and time scales of the real memory devices. The simulations provide a vivid atomistic picture of the subtle interplay between crystal nucleation and crystal growth from the crystal/amorphous rim. Moreover, the simulations have allowed quantifying the distribution of point defects controlling electronic transport, in a very large crystallite grown at the real conditions of the set process of the device.

# BKT transitions of the XY and six-state clock models on the various two-dimensional lattices

## 各种二维晶格上XY和六态时钟模型的BKT跃迁

**Authors:** Yutaka Okabe, Hiromi Otsuka

arXiv:2501.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a two-dimensional (2D) spin system, the XY model, characterized by planar rotational symmetry, exhibits a unique phenomenon known as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. In contrast, the clock model, which introduces discrete rotational symmetry, exhibits the BKT transition at two different temperatures due to this discreteness. In this study, we numerically investigate the BKT transition for XY and six-state clock models over various two-dimensional lattices. We employ two primary methods: the Monte Carlo method, which analyzes the size dependence of the ratio of the correlation functions for two different distances, and a machine-learning approach to classify the different phases -- namely, the low-temperature ordered phase, the intermediate BKT phase, and the high-temperature disordered phase. We identify the BKT transition temperatures for the XY and six-state models on honeycomb, kagome, and diced lattices. Combined with the previously calculated data for the triangular lattice, we then compare these values with the second-order phase transition temperatures of the 2D Ising model, for which exact solutions are known. Our results indicate that the ratio of the BKT transition temperatures for each lattice relative to the Ising model transition temperatures are close, although the values are not universal.

# Mechanics and Design of Metastructured Auxetic Patches with Bio-inspired Materials

Abstract: Metastructured auxetic patches, characterized by negative Poisson's ratios, offer unique mechanical properties that closely resemble the behavior of human tissues and organs. As a result, these patches have gained significant attention for their potential applications in organ repair and tissue regeneration. This study focuses on neural networks-based computational modeling of auxetic patches with a sinusoidal metastructure fabricated from silk fibroin, a bio-inspired material known for its biocompatibility and strength. The primary objective of this research is to introduce a novel, data-driven framework for patch design. To achieve this, we conducted experimental fabrication and mechanical testing to determine material properties and validate the corresponding finite element models. Finite element simulations were then employed to generate the necessary data, while greedy sampling, an active learning technique, was utilized to reduce the computational cost associated with data labeling. Two neural networks were trained to accurately predict Poisson's ratios and stresses for strains up to 15\%, respectively. Both models achieved $R^2$ scores exceeding 0.995, which indicates highly reliable predictions. Building on this, we developed a neural network-based design model capable of tailoring patch designs to achieve specific mechanical properties. This model demonstrated superior performance when compared to traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, by providing more efficient and precise design solutions. The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in the design of bio-inspired metastructures for medical applications, paving the way for future innovations in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

arXiv:2501.06916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.

**Authors:** Qi You, Yan Sun, Feng Wang, Jun Cheng, Fujie Tang

arXiv:2501.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.

Abstract: Spectral densities encode essential information about system-environment interactions in open-quantum systems, playing a pivotal role in shaping the system's dynamics. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to reconstruct key environmental features, going beyond the weak-coupling regime by simulating the system's dynamics using the reaction coordinate mapping. For a dissipative spin-boson model with a structured spectral density expressed as a sum of Lorentzian peaks, we demonstrate that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by a neural network to classify the spectral density as comprising one, two, or three Lorentzian peaks and accurately predict their central frequency.

Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.

Abstract: The rapid development of quantum dot (QD) devices for quantum computing has necessitated more efficient and automated methods for device characterization and tuning. This work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying explainable machine learning techniques to the analysis of quantum dot measurements, paving the way for further advances in automated and transparent QD device tuning. Many of the measurements acquired during the tuning process come in the form of images that need to be properly analyzed to guide the subsequent tuning steps. By design, features present in such images capture certain behaviors or states of the measured QD devices. When considered carefully, such features can aid the control and calibration of QD devices. An important example of such images are so-called $\textit{triangle plots}$, which visually represent current flow and reveal characteristics important for QD device calibration. While image-based classification tools, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to verify whether a given measurement is $\textit{good}$ and thus warrants the initiation of the next phase of tuning, they do not provide any insights into how the device should be adjusted in the case of $\textit{bad}$ images. This is because CNNs sacrifice prediction and model intelligibility for high accuracy. To ameliorate this trade-off, a recent study introduced an image vectorization approach that relies on the Gabor wavelet transform (Schug $\textit{et al.}$ 2024 $\textit{Proc. XAI4Sci: Explainable Machine Learning for Sciences Workshop (AAAI 2024) (Vancouver, Canada)}$ pp 1-6). Here we propose an alternative vectorization method that involves mathematical modeling of synthetic triangles to mimic the experimental data. Using explainable boosting machines, we show that this new method offers superior explainability of model prediction without sacrificing accuracy.

arXiv:2412.18290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing near-term quantum devices to tackle temporal machine learning tasks. Yet identifying the mechanisms that underlie enhanced performance remains challenging, particularly in many-body open systems where nonlinear interactions and dissipation intertwine in complex ways. Here, we investigate a minimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that features controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon loss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different dynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy (information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible only through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a critical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from predominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that synergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory retention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that supports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay of instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum systems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for analyzing and designing QRC platforms.

**Authors:** Yousef Heider, Fadi Aldakheel, Wolfgang Ehlers

arXiv:2501.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel application for predicting the macroscopic intrinsic permeability tensor in deformable porous media, using a limited set of micro-CT images of real microgeometries. The primary goal is to develop an efficient, machine-learning (ML)-based method that overcomes the limitations of traditional permeability estimation techniques, which often rely on time-consuming experiments or computationally expensive fluid dynamics simulations. The novelty of this work lies in leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict pore-fluid flow behavior under deformation and anisotropic flow conditions. Particularly, the described approach employs binarized CT images of porous micro-structure as inputs to predict the symmetric second-order permeability tensor, a critical parameter in continuum porous media flow modeling. The methodology comprises four key steps: (1) constructing a dataset of CT images from Bentheim sandstone at different volumetric strain levels; (2) performing pore-scale simulations of single-phase flow using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate permeability data; (3) training the CNN model with the processed CT images as inputs and permeability tensors as outputs; and (4) exploring techniques to improve model generalization, including data augmentation and alternative CNN architectures. Examples are provided to demonstrate the CNN's capability to accurately predict the permeability tensor, a crucial parameter in various disciplines such as geotechnical engineering, hydrology, and material science. An exemplary source code is made available for interested readers.

Abstract: Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) can provide constant, reliable electricity and heat with minimal emissions, but high drilling costs and uncertain cost reductions leave their future unclear. We explore scenarios for the future adoption of EGS in a carbon-neutral, multi-sector European energy system. We find that in a net-zero system, heat (co-)generating EGS at current cost can support 20--30 GWth of capacity in Europe, primarily driven by district heating demands. When drilling costs decrease by approximately 60%, EGS becomes competitive in electricity markets, expanding its market opportunity by one order of magnitude. However, the spatially dispersed rollout of district heating contrasts with the confined overlap of high geological potential and low potential for other renewables, which conditions the competitiveness of electricity-generating EGS. This results in a challenge where the majority of EGS market potential depends on pan-European technology learning for cost reductions, emphasising coordination is crucial in stakeholders' efforts to reduce EGS cost.

**Authors:** Jinlong Fu, Wei Tan

arXiv:2501.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding microstructure-property relationships (MPRs) is essential for optimising the performance of multiphase composites. Image-based poro/micro-mechanical modelling provides a non-invasive approach to exploring MPRs, but the randomness of multiphase composites often necessitates extensive 3D microstructure datasets for statistical reliability. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning framework to reconstruct numerous virtual 3D microstructures from limited 2D exemplars, circumventing the high costs of volumetric microscopy. Using feedforward neural networks, termed the statistics-encoded neural network (SENN), the framework encodes 2D morphological statistics and infers 3D morphological statistics via a 2D-to-3D integration scheme. Statistically equivalent 3D microstructures are synthesised using Gibbs sampling. Hierarchical characterisation enables seamless capture of features across multiple scales. Validation on three composites demonstrates strong statistical equivalence between reconstructed and reference microstructures, confirmed by morphological descriptors and simulated macroscopic properties (e.g., stiffness, permeability). The SENN-based framework is a high-fidelity tool for efficiently and accurately reconstructing multiphase microstructures.

Abstract: Problem-based learning benefits from situations taken from real life, which arouse student interest. The shooting of Rwanda president aircraft on April 6th, 1994 is still unsolved. We discuss the methods to infer informations and conclusions about where the aircraft was shot and its trajectory during its fall, as well as about the place from which the missiles were launched, their trajectory and type. To this goal, we compile expert reports, witness indications and other public sources, then translate plain language sentences into quantitative equalities and inequalities applied to geometry and mechanics at undergraduate level. The precision of each result is discussed and propagated in order to ensure a proper assessment of the hypotheses and a traceability of their consequences. Overall, the precision discussion can train the students critical mind, and teach inference methods which are routinely used in several fields of physics research. In addition, it demonstrates the importance and limits of scientific expertise during a judiciary process.

**Authors:** Ciro Campolina, Eric Simonnet, Simon Thalabard

arXiv:2501.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong numerical hints exist in favor of a universal blowup scenario in the Sabra shell model, perhaps the most popular cascade models of 3D turbulence, which features complex velocity variables on a geometric progression of scales $\ell_n \propto \lambda ^{-n}$. The blowup is thought to be of self-similar type and characterized by the finite-time convergence towards a universal profile with non-Kolmogorov (anomalous) small-scale scaling $\propto \ell_n^{x}$. Solving the underlying nonlinear eigenvalue problem has however proven challenging, and prior insights mainly used the Dombre-Gilson renormalization scheme, transforming self-similar solutions into solitons propagating over infinite rescaled time horizon. Here, we further characterize Sabra blowups by implementing two strategies targeting the eigenvalue problem. The first involves formal expansion in terms of the bookkeeping parameter $\delta = (1-x)\log \lambda$, and interpretes the self-similar solution as a (degenerate) homoclinic bifurcation. Using standard bifurcation toolkits, we show that the homoclinic bifurcations identified under finite-truncation of the series converge to the observed Sabra solution. The second strategy uses machine-learning optimization to solve directly for the Sabra eigenvalue. It reveals an intricate phase space, with the presence of a continuous family of non-universal blowup profiles, characterized by various number $N$ of pulses and exponents $x_N\ge x$.

Abstract: Recent research indicates that the use of multiple external representations MERs has the potential to support learning, especially in complex scientific areas, such as quantum physics. In particular, the provision of informationally redundant external representations can have advantageous effects on learning outcomes. This is of special relevance for quantum education, where various external representations are available and their effective use is recognised as crucial to student learning. However, research on the effects of informationally redundant external representations in quantum learning is limited. The present study aims to contribute to the development of effective learning materials by investigating the effects of learning with informationally redundant external representations on students' learning of quantum physics. Using a between-subjects design, 113 students were randomly assigned to one of four learning conditions. The control group learnt with a traditional multimedia learning unit on the behaviour of a single photon in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The three intervention groups received redundant essential information in the Dirac formalism, the Bloch sphere, or both. The use of eye tracking enabled insight into the learning process depending on the external representations provided. While the results indicate no effect of the study condition on learning outcomes (content knowledge and cognitive load), the analysis of visual behaviour reveals decreased learning efficiency with the addition of the Bloch sphere to the multimedia learning unit. The results are discussed based on current insight in learning with MERs. The study emphasises the need for careful instructional design to balance the associated cognitive load when learning with informationally redundant external representations.

arXiv:2501.06300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a tensorization algorithm for constructing tensor train representations of functions, drawing on sketching and cross interpolation ideas. The method only requires black-box access to the target function and a small set of sample points defining the domain of interest. Thus, it is particularly well-suited for machine learning models, where the domain of interest is naturally defined by the training dataset. We show that this approach can be used to enhance the privacy and interpretability of neural network models. Specifically, we apply our decomposition to (i) obfuscate neural networks whose parameters encode patterns tied to the training data distribution, and (ii) estimate topological phases of matter that are easily accessible from the tensor train representation. Additionally, we show that this tensorization can serve as an efficient initialization method for optimizing tensor trains in general settings, and that, for model compression, our algorithm achieves a superior trade-off between memory and time complexity compared to conventional tensorization methods of neural networks.

Abstract: We show how random feature maps can be used to forecast dynamical systems with excellent forecasting skill. We consider the tanh activation function and judiciously choose the internal weights in a data-driven manner such that the resulting features explore the nonlinear, non-saturated regions of the activation function. We introduce skip connections and construct a deep variant of random feature maps by combining several units. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, we introduce localization where we learn local maps, employing conditional independence. Our modified random feature maps provide excellent forecasting skill for both single trajectory forecasts as well as long-time estimates of statistical properties, for a range of chaotic dynamical systems with dimensions up to 512. In contrast to other methods such as reservoir computers which require extensive hyperparameter tuning, we effectively need to tune only a single hyperparameter, and are able to achieve state-of-the-art forecast skill with much smaller networks.

Abstract: Deep learning models for anticipating the products of organic reactions have found many use cases, including validating retrosynthetic pathways and constraining synthesis-based molecular design tools. Despite compelling performance on popular benchmark tasks, strange and erroneous predictions sometimes ensue when using these models in practice. The core issue is that common benchmarks test models in an in-distribution setting, whereas many real-world uses for these models are in out-of-distribution settings and require a greater degree of extrapolation. To better understand how current reaction predictors work in out-of-distribution domains, we report a series of more challenging evaluations of a prototypical SMILES-based deep learning model. First, we illustrate how performance on randomly sampled datasets is overly optimistic compared to performance when generalizing to new patents or new authors. Second, we conduct time splits that evaluate how models perform when tested on reactions published in years after those in their training set, mimicking real-world deployment. Finally, we consider extrapolation across reaction classes to reflect what would be required for the discovery of novel reaction types. This panel of tasks can reveal the capabilities and limitations of today's reaction predictors, acting as a crucial first step in the development of tomorrow's next-generation models capable of reaction discovery.

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have evolved rapidly in recent years, significantly impacting various scientific fields, including experimental particle physics. To effectively leverage the latest developments in computer science for particle physics, a strengthened collaboration between computer scientists and physicists is essential. As all machine learning techniques depend on the availability and comprehensibility of extensive data, clear data descriptions and commonly used data formats are prerequisites for successful collaboration. In this study, we converted open data from the Large Hadron Collider, recorded in the ROOT data format commonly used in high-energy physics, to pandas DataFrames, a well-known format in computer science. Additionally, we provide a brief introduction to the data's content and interpretation. This paper aims to serve as a starting point for future interdisciplinary collaborations between computer scientists and physicists, fostering closer ties and facilitating efficient knowledge exchange.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Discrete Equilibrium (NeurDE), a machine learning (ML) approach for long-term forecasting of flow phenomena that relies on a "lifting" of physical conservation laws into the framework of kinetic theory. The kinetic formulation provides an excellent structure for ML algorithms by separating nonlinear, non-local physics into a nonlinear but local relaxation to equilibrium and a linear non-local transport. This separation allows the ML to focus on the local nonlinear components while addressing the simpler linear transport with efficient classical numerical algorithms. To accomplish this, we design an operator network that maps macroscopic observables to equilibrium states in a manner that maximizes entropy, yielding expressive BGK-type collisions. By incorporating our surrogate equilibrium into the lattice Boltzmann (LB) algorithm, we achieve accurate flow forecasts for a wide range of challenging flows. We show that NeurDE enables accurate prediction of compressible flows, including supersonic flows, while tracking shocks over hundreds of time steps, using a small velocity lattice-a heretofore unattainable feat without expensive numerical root finding.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the diverse conformational states of molecules is crucial for advancing fields such as chemistry, material science, and drug development. Despite significant progress in generative models, accurately generating complex and biologically or material-relevant molecular structures remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model for three-dimensional (3D) molecule generation that combines a classifiable diffusion model, Diffusion Transformer, with multihead equivariant self-attention. This method addresses two key challenges: correctly attaching hydrogen atoms in generated molecules through learning representations of molecules after hydrogen atoms are removed; and overcoming the limitations of existing models that cannot generate molecules across multiple classes simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across several key metrics but also exhibits robustness and versatility, making it highly suitable for early-stage large-scale generation processes in molecular design, followed by validation and further screening to obtain molecules with specific properties.

## Dynami-cal GraphNet: 为动力系统保留线性和角动量的物理通知图神经网络

**Authors:** Vinay Sharma, Olga Fink

arXiv:2501.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for predicting behaviors and inferring physical properties in natural and engineered environments. Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.

Abstract: The reconstruction of electrical current densities from magnetic field measurements is an important technique with applications in materials science, circuit design, quality control, plasma physics, and biology. Analytic reconstruction methods exist for planar currents, but break down in the presence of high spatial frequency noise or large standoff distance, restricting the types of systems that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate the use of a deep convolutional neural network for current density reconstruction from two-dimensional (2D) images of vector magnetic fields acquired by a quantum diamond microscope (QDM) utilizing a surface layer of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Trained network performance significantly exceeds analytic reconstruction for data with high noise or large standoff distances. This machine learning technique can perform quality inversions on lower SNR data, reducing the data collection time by a factor of about 400 and permitting reconstructions of weaker and three-dimensional current sources.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into chemistry offers transformative potential in the design of molecules with targeted properties. However, the focus has often been on creating highly efficient predictive models, sometimes at the expense of interpretability. In this study, we leverage explainable AI techniques to explore the rational design of boron-based Lewis acids, which play a pivotal role in organic reactions due to their electron-ccepting properties. Using Fluoride Ion Affinity as a proxy for Lewis acidity, we developed interpretable ML models based on chemically meaningful descriptors, including ab initio computed features and substituent-based parameters derived from the Hammett linear free-energy relationship. By constraining the chemical space to well-defined molecular scaffolds, we achieved highly accurate predictions (mean absolute error < 6 kJ/mol), surpassing conventional black-box deep learning models in low-data regimes. Interpretability analyses of the models shed light on the origin of Lewis acidity in these compounds and identified actionable levers to modulate it through the nature and positioning of substituents on the molecular scaffold. This work bridges ML and chemist's way of thinking, demonstrating how explainable models can inspire molecular design and enhance scientific understanding of chemical reactivity.

# A Novel Training Framework for Physics-informed Neural Networks: Towards Real-time Applications in Ultrafast Ultrasound Blood Flow Imaging

## 用于物理信息神经网络的新型训练框架: 在超快超声血流成像中的实时应用

Abstract: Ultrafast ultrasound blood flow imaging is a state-of-the-art technique for depiction of complex blood flow dynamics in vivo through thousands of full-view image data (or, timestamps) acquired per second. Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) is one of the most preeminent solvers of the Navier-Stokes equations, widely used as the governing equation of blood flow. However, that current approaches rely on full Navier-Stokes equations is impractical for ultrafast ultrasound. We hereby propose a novel PINN training framework for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. It involves discretizing Navier-Stokes equations into steady state and sequentially solving them with test-time adaptation. The novel training framework is coined as SeqPINN. Upon its success, we propose a parallel training scheme for all timestamps based on averaged constant stochastic gradient descent as initialization. Uncertainty estimation through Stochastic Weight Averaging Gaussian is then used as an indicator of generalizability of the initialization. This algorithm, named SP-PINN, further expedites training of PINN while achieving comparable accuracy with SeqPINN. The performance of SeqPINN and SP-PINN was evaluated through finite-element simulations and in vitro phantoms of single-branch and trifurcate blood vessels. Results show that both algorithms were manyfold faster than the original design of PINN, while respectively achieving Root Mean Square Errors of 0.63 cm/s and 0.81 cm/s on the straight vessel and 1.35 cm/s and 1.63 cm/s on the trifurcate vessel when recovering blood flow velocities. The successful implementation of SeqPINN and SP-PINN open the gate for real-time training of PINN for Navier-Stokes equations and subsequently reliable imaging-based blood flow assessment in clinical practice.

Abstract: Reliable molecular property prediction is essential for various scientific endeavors and industrial applications, such as drug discovery. However, the data scarcity, combined with the highly non-linear causal relationships between physicochemical and biological properties and conventional molecular featurization schemes, complicates the development of robust molecular machine learning models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a popular solution, utilizing large-scale, unannotated molecular data to learn a foundational representation of chemical space that might be advantageous for downstream tasks. Yet, existing molecular SSL methods largely overlook chemical knowledge, including molecular structure similarity, scaffold composition, and the context-dependent aspects of molecular properties when operating over the chemical space. They also struggle to learn the subtle variations in structure-activity relationship. This paper introduces a novel pre-training framework that learns robust and generalizable chemical knowledge. It leverages the structural hierarchy within the molecule, embeds them through distinct pre-training tasks across channels, and aggregates channel information in a task-specific manner during fine-tuning. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance across various molecular property benchmarks and offers strong advantages in particularly challenging yet ubiquitous scenarios like activity cliffs.

# ACES-GNN: Can Graph Neural Network Learn to Explain Activity Cliffs?

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-11wfv?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Fang , Liu

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized molecular property prediction by leveraging graph-based representations, yet their opaque decision-making processes hinder broader adoption in drug discovery. This study introduces the Activity-Cliff-Explanation-Supervised GNN (ACES-GNN) framework, designed to simultaneously improve predictive accuracy and interpretability by integrating explanation supervision for activity cliffs (ACs) into GNN training. ACs, defined by structurally similar molecules with significant potency differences, pose challenges for traditional models due to their reliance on shared structural features. By aligning model attributions with chemist-friendly interpretations, the ACES-GNN framework bridges the gap between prediction and explanation. Validated across 30 pharmacological targets, ACES-GNN consistently enhances both predictive accuracy and attribution quality compared to baseline methods. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between improved predictions and accurate explanations, offering a robust and adaptable framework for addressing the "intra-scaffold" generalization problem. This work underscores the potential of explanation-guided learning to advance interpretable artificial intelligence in molecular modeling and drug discovery.

**Authors:** Darik, Rosser

The ability to rapidly regress the kinetic parameters from cyclic voltammograms is important for many laboratory automation endeavors.  Inspired by how expert electrochemists can rapidly interpret cyclic voltammograms simply by their shape, here we show that convolutional neural networks (similar to those used in handwriting analysis) can successfully regress both the kinetic rate constant and transfer coefficient of cyclic voltammetry data.  This type of machine learning models obtained 93.6% five fold cross validation accuracy, and could obtain both the kinetic rate constant and transfer coefficient in a few milliseconds. This is in comparison to over 3000 seconds using an optimization protocol with finite elemental analysis to regress the kinetic parameters via solving the governing differential equations.  This advancement will be very useful for many electrochemical applications where high-throughput experimentation is necessary.

**Authors:** Alex M., Bronstein

We investigate the locality of magnetic response in polycyclic aromatic molecules using a novel deep-learning approach. Our method employs graph neural networks (GNNs) with a graph-of-rings representation to predict Nucleus-Independent Chemical Shifts in the space around the molecule. We train a series of models, each time reducing the size of the largest molecules used in training. The accuracy of prediction remains high (MAE < 0.5 ppm), even when training the model only on molecules with up to 4 rings, thus providing strong evidence for the locality of magnetic response. To overcome the known problem of generalization of GNNs, we implement a k-hop expansion strategy and succeed in achieving accurate predictions for molecules with up to 15 rings (almost 4 times the size of the largest training example). Our findings have implications for understanding the magnetic response in complex molecules and demonstrate a promising approach to overcoming GNN scalability limitations. Furthermore, the trained models enable rapid characterization, without the need for more expensive DFT calculations.

**Authors:** Robin, Kryštůfek

Mass spectrometry is one of the most effective analytical methods for unknown compound identification. By comparing observed m/z spectra with a database of experimentally determined spectra, this process identifies compound(s) in any given sample. Unknown sample identification is thus limited to whatever has been experimentally determined. To address the reliance on experimentally determined signatures, multiple state-of-the-art MS spectra prediction algorithms have been developed within the past half decade. Here we evaluate the accuracy of the NEIMS spectral prediction algorithm. We focus our analyses on monosubstituted α-amino acids given their significance as important targets for astrobiology, synthetic biology, and diverse biomedical applications. Our general intent is to inform those using generated spectra for detection of unknown biomolecules. We find predicted spectra are inaccurate for amino acids beyond the algorithms training data. Interestingly, these inaccuracies are not explained by physicochemical differences or the derivatization state of the amino acids measured. We thus highlight the need to improve both current machine learning based approaches and further optimization of ab initio spectral prediction algorithms so as to expand databases for structures beyond what is currently experimentally possible, even including theoretical molecules.

# Ether-linked phospholipidomic profiling unveils novel lipid fingerprints and algorithm predicts the future development of carotid plaques in postmenopausal women: a population-based cohort study

## 醚连接的磷脂谱揭示了新的脂质指纹和算法预测绝经后妇女颈动脉斑块的未来发展: 一项基于人群的队列研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5738378/latest

Background
Serum ether-linked phospholipids (ePLs) have gained attention in metabolic disease research. Postmenopausal women face a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis (AS), yet current methods for risk prediction and understanding of AS pathophysiology remain limited. This study aimed to identify ePL biomarkers linked to AS, assess their chemical composition in relation to AS risk, and explore whether their impact is mediated by clinical risk factors in postmenopausal women.
Methods
Here, this research was conducted within the Rose Asymptomatic Intracranial Artery Stenosis (RICAS) prospective study and included 203 postmenopausal women without carotid plaques at baseline. After a median follow-up of 3.8 years, 51 participants developed new carotid plaques. Baseline serum ePLs were semi-quantitated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
Results
The mean age of participants was 60.51 (&plusmn;7.83) years. A total of 85 unique ePL species across five lipid subclasses were identified and quantified according to lipid internal standards. Multivariate models indicated global metabolic disruptions in ePLs preceding carotid plaque formation. Six ePLs were identified as potential biomarkers associated with AS risk (VIP &amp;gt; 1, p &amp;lt; 0.05, FDR &amp;lt; 0.05). After adjusting for age, BMI, TG, and LDL-C, four polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing ePLs remained significantly associated with carotid plaque risk (OR &amp;gt; 1, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Causal mediation analysis indicated that LDL-C mediated the effects of these ePLs on AS. A machine-learning model incorporating these ePLs with clinical parameters significantly improved carotid plaque prediction (AUC: 0.835, Net Reclassification Improvement &amp;gt; 0, p &amp;lt; 0.001).
Conclusion
This study highlighted importance of metabolic disruption in PUFA-ePLs for the development of AS. Our findings support the notion that metabolic disruption of PUFA-ePLs can affect LDL-C levels, which is the primary driver of AS in postmenopausal women. Ether-linked phospholipidome as a valuable phenotype hold potential clinical utility in the prediction of AS.

Objective This study aims to develop a reliable and interpretable predictive model for the risk of long-term survival in type A aortic dissection (TAAD) patients, utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms.Methods  We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data diagnosed with Type A Aortic Dissection (TAAD) who underwent open surgical repair at our institution between September 2017 and December 2020. Cases with less than 20% missing data were imputed using random forest algorithms. To identify significant prognostic factors, we performed LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Cox regression analysis, including preoperative blood markers, previous medical history and perioperative condition. Based on the advantages of the model and the characteristics of the dataset, we subsequently developed a machine learning-based prognostic model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and evaluated its performance across key metrics. To further explain the decision-making process of the SVM model, we employed SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values for model interpretation.Results A total of 175 patients with TAAD were included in the study. Through LASSO Cox regression, univariate analysis, and clinical relevance assessment, eight feature variables were selected for modeling. Performance evaluation revealed that the SVM model showed excellent performance in both the training and test sets, with no significant overfitting, indicating strong clinical applicability. In the training set, the model achieved an AUC of 0.9247 (95% CI: 0.9200&amp;ndash;0.9279), and in the testing set, 0.8800 (95% CI: 0.8492&amp;ndash;0.9396). The accuracy was 0.8663 and 0.8857, precision was 0.8627 and 1.0000, recall was 0.8713 and 0.7333, F1 score was 0.8670 and 0.8462, Brier score was 0.1068 and 0.1070, average precision (AP) was 0.9266 and 0.9086, and C-index was 0.8901 and 0.8700, respectively. SHAP analysis identified that longer ICU hospital stay, abdominal pain, plasma transfusion volume, creatinine, white blood cell count, operation time, and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) had significant positive impact on the model's predictions.Conclusion This study developed an interpretable predictive model based on the SVM algorithm to assess long-term survival in TAAD patients. The model demonstrated accuracy, precision, and robustness in identifying high-risk patients, providing clinicians with reliable evidence for prognosis management.

# Design and Fabrication of Soft Prosthetic Hand

## 柔软假手的设计与制作

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5812474/latest

This study focuses on the development of soft robotic hand designed to aid individuals with hand disabilities, particularly those paralyzed due to strokes. Globally, strokes affect 15 million people annually, leading to 5 million deaths and leaving another 5 million with permanent disabilities that significantly impact their lives and communities. The soft robotic hand developed attempts to addresses the limitations of traditional robotic hands through the use of PneuNets, a pneumatic network framework that mimics the structure and function of a human hand. The hand's design incorporates pneumatic chambers that enable controlled finger movements, essential for grasping, lifting, and manipulating objects with precision. The primary components of the hand were fabricated using additive manufacturing and molding techniques, with a silicone outer layer added to enhance safety and compliance. The microcontroller-based control system is tailored to execute desired actions effectively, ensuring the soft hand&rsquo;s adaptability to various tasks. Performance evaluations involved both simple and complex task profiles, demonstrating the hand's capability to handle a variety of objects with low variability in force and high precision. Specific technical results include the measurement of grasping forces, pressure requirements for actuation, and the assessment of attenuation losses during operation. Prior designs of soft robotic hands often suffer from issues like single-mode gripping and high attenuation losses; our approach mitigates these challenges through an optimized mechanical design coupled with learning algorithms that enhance grasping and manipulation efficiency. The soft characteristics of the robotic hand allow it to adapt its shape, making it capable of handling objects of varying sizes and shapes, thereby improving the daily functionality for individuals with hand impairments. This novel design not only offers increased independence and quality of life for patients but also provides a cost-effective and easily producible solution for wearable soft robotics.

# Enhancing high school students&rsquo; understanding and attitude towards quantum mechanics through discipline- culture framework and cognitive apprenticeship

## 通过学科文化框架和认知学徒制提高高中生对量子力学的理解和态度

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5323874/latest

Background: The second quantum revolution is in progress, driven by rapid advancements in quantum technology (QT), promising significant job creation and socio-economic impact. Early exposure of students to quantum mechanics (QM) is essential to meet the growing demand for a quantum-competent workforce for the QT industry. Despite this, students typically encounter QM only at the university level, often after finalising their career pathways. Global efforts are underway to introduce QM and QT at the high school level. However, QT outreach programs integrated into sustainable school-led activities are rare, with most initiatives led by government-funded research agencies.
Purpose: We present the findings from a school-initiated quantum education and outreach endeavour implemented through a completely online STEM &amp;amp; Research Internship Program (SRIP) for high school students in the Philippines. The program aimed to introduce QM and QT to students, enhance their understanding of QM and QT, improve their attitude towards QM, and introduce them to career opportunities in the QT industry.
Sample: Twenty students (eleven males, nine females) studying in Grades 9- 11 from four campuses of a STEM-focused high school in the Philippines participated in the study.
Research design:We employed a quasi-experimental research design, utilizing a single-group pre- and post-test format with a mixed-methods approach for data collection. The SRIP, completed in eighty hours over two weeks, served as the intervention. Our theoretical framework combined the discipline-culture (DC) approach and the cognitive apprenticeship (CA) model for teaching physics.
Method: First, we used the DC framework to design a structured curriculum introducing QM and QT to high school students. The DC framework organises the curriculum into three components- core principles of the discipline (nucleus), their applications (body), and misconceptions, contrasting ideas or future developments that directly challenge the core principles (periphery). Next, we used the CA model to implement the curriculum and deliver the learning material. Within the CA model, a variety of research-based pedagogies were employed, including the flipped classroom, guided inquiry, games and simulations, project-based learning and educational videos to effectively deliver the learning material incorporating our designed curriculum.
Data collection: We utilized research-validated instruments for pre-and post-tests, including the Quantum Physics Conceptual Survey (QPCS), the Quantum Technology Inventory (QTI), and the Attitude Towards Quantum Mechanics (ATQM) survey to gather quantitative data on students&rsquo; understanding of QM and their attitude towards the subject. Furthermore, we collected qualitative data from students&rsquo; daily journal entries, where they reflected on their experiences by responding to open-ended questions. We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to perform an inferential analysis of the QPCS and ATQM survey, while QTI was evaluated using descriptive statistics. Additionally, the qualitative data, derived from students&rsquo; daily journal entries, was analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.
Results: We observed a statistically significant positive shift (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in students&rsquo; knowledge of quantum mechanics and their attitude towards the discipline. The descriptive statistics from the QTI further indicate an improvement in students&rsquo; understanding of concepts related to QT. The themes emerging from the qualitative data also indicated positive experiences, improved understanding of quantum phenomena, and more favourable attitudes toward QM after the program
Conclusion: The results, supported by data and method triangulation, demonstrate the program&rsquo;s positive educational impact, particularly as the first school-initiated quantum outreach initiative of its kind. The SRIP successfully met its objectives by improving high school students&rsquo; understanding of advanced QM and QT concepts while fostering a positive attitude towards QM. Additionally, students reported healthy interactions with peers and mentors&mdash;crucial elements for their holistic development.

# A Practical Inverse Design Approach for High-Entropy Catalysts with Generative AI

## 具有生成AI的高熵催化剂的实用逆设计方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5712388/latest

The vast compositional space of high-entropy materials offers unprecedented opportunities for the development of powerful catalysts. However, their inverse design remains unfeasible due to the lack of robust theoretical frameworks and high-throughput experimental tools. This study demonstrates a practical inverse design approach that integrates spectroscopic descriptors, generative machine learning, and a robotic experimental platform to synthesize and optimize catalyst composition for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The automated system significantly accelerated catalysts design and experimental validation, reducing the time required for synthesis, characterization and performance testing from approximately 20 hours to only 78 minutes per sample. Following a rapid screen for efficient senary high-entropy catalysts, the spectroscopic generative model further optimized the top-performing candidate, lowering its overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 by an additional 32 mV. Our findings are a testament to the potential of an inverse design approach that incorporates spectroscopic descriptors into generative machine learning to accelerate catalyst discovery. Moreover, this approach is also expected to drive the intelligent design of high-performance complex materials.

# Hybrid Graph Learning Reconstructs Global Ocean Oxygen Spatiotemporal Changes

## 混合图学习重构全球海洋氧时空变化

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5587966/latest

Climate change and anthropogenic activities have exacerbated hypoxic conditions in the global ocean, threatening marine ecosystems and earth sustainability. Investigating the history of ocean deoxygenation is crucial for developing coping strategies. However, due to the severe sparse in-situ observations and spatiotemporal complexity of deoxygenation mechanism, precise modelling of the oxygen trends, especially in large scale, remains a long-standing problem. Here we propose Jingwei, a hybrid graph learning framework that integrates observation data and ocean climate model in a complementary manner, accurately reconstructing global oxygen levels over the past six decades. A knowledge retrieval module is designed to learn the hidden laws that dominate the complex mechanism of oxygen changes from model-based simulations. Constrained by those laws, a knowledge propagation module spatiotemporally connects the sparse data, capturing dynamic and spatial heterogeneous oxygen loss. With a joint consideration of invariant laws and variant factors, Jingwei significantly reduces reconstruction error, achieving equal accuracy with the dense cruise surveys. It can quantitatively trace the expansion process of oxygen minimum zones (OMZ), revealing potential drivers, effectively supporting on-target strategies. We foresee that the implications of such a graph-based hybrid framework extend beyond ocean deoxygenation and pave way for next-generation earth system modelling.

Fluid-solid interaction(FSI) has always been a hot topic in the field of fluid mechanics. Because the flow field of FSI is highly inhomogeneous, when the initial conditions change with time, the inhomogeneity of the flow field in time and space will be further aggravated. The forward and inverse solutions of physical information neural networks (PINNs) in fluid mechanics have been widely studied and significant progress has been made. The technology of learning and reconstructing the flow field with PINNs is relatively mature. However, there are still large errors in predicting the flow field with uneven temporal and spatial distribution. Neural networks(NN) cannot capture some local details in learning. In addition, the generalization characteristics of NNs will also weaken the learning of local highlight areas. Therefore, inspired by the confidence weight, this paper proposes a local reinforcement learning (LRL) method to solve the above problems. It is found that LRL has a good effect on local learning. Based on the LRL method, the applicability of three different NN frameworks in the reconstruction of FSI flow fields is tested, namely, multilayer perceptron(MLP), KAN and KAN&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;MLP. For the MLP framework, the details of the inhomogeneous flow field can be learned more accurately. For the KAN framework, by setting different depths and widths for NN, it is found that the prediction accuracy of KAN does not depend on the scale of NN, but has specific settings for specific problems. However, when applying the LRL method, the prediction effect of KAN is not particularly ideal, so the KAN&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;MLP framework is proposed as an improved method. The prediction effect is relatively ideal, but it takes a lot of time to train. In this study, the performance of the new framework KAN in inhomogeneous flow field is tested, which provides ideas and basis for further research on its application scope and practical effect in fluid mechanics.

This paper introduces Meta-Domain Adaptive Transfer (MDAT), a novel approach combining meta-learning, adaptive domain randomization, and feature disentanglement for rapid adaptation in simulated robotic tasks. We evaluate MDAT across three distinct robotic scenarios: object manipulation, navigation, and bipedal locomotion. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptation speed, task performance, and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods such as MAML, Traditional Transfer Learning (TTL), Domain Randomization (DR), and Progressive Neural Networks (PNN).
