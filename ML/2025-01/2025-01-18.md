Abstract: This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.

arXiv:2501.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of supercapacitors is impeded by the unclear relationships between nanoporous electrode structures and electrochemical performance, primarily due to challenges in decoupling the complex interdependencies of various structural descriptors. While machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution, their application is hindered by the lack of large, unified databases. Herein, we use constant-potential molecular simulation to construct a unified supercapacitor database with hundreds of metal-organic framework (MOF) electrodes. Leveraging this database, well-trained decision-tree-based ML models achieve fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions of capacitance and charging rate, experimentally validated by a representative case. SHAP analyses reveal that specific surface area (SSA) governs gravimetric capacitance while pore size effects are minimal, attributed to the strong dependence of electrode-ion coordination on SSA rather than pore size. SSA and porosity, respectively, dominate volumetric capacitance in 1D-pore and 3D-pore MOFs, pinnacling the indispensable effects of pore dimensionality. Meanwhile, porosity is found to be the most decisive factor in the charging rate for both 1D-pore and 3D-pore MOFs. Especially for 3D-pore MOFs, an exponential increase with porosity is observed in both ionic conductance and in-pore ion diffusion coefficient, ascribed to loosened ion packing. These findings provide profound insights for the design of high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.

# Edge-Dependent Step-Flow Growth Mechanism in $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ (100) Facet at the Atomic Level

Abstract: Homoepitaxial step-flow growth of high-quality $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ thin films is essential for the advancement of high-performance Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$-based devices. In this work, the step-flow growth mechanism of $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ (100) facet is explored by machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. Our results reveal that Ga adatoms and Ga-O adatom pairs, with their high mobility, are the primary atomic species responsible for efficient surface migration on the (100) facet. The asymmetric monoclinic structure of $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ induces a distinct two-stage Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier for Ga adatoms at the [00$\overline{1}$] step edge, contributing to the suppression of double-step and hillock formation. Furthermore, a miscut towards [00$\overline{1}$] does not induce the nucleation of stable twin boundaries, whereas a miscut towards [001] leads to the spontaneous formation of twin boundaries. This research provides meaningful insights not only for high-quality $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ homoepitaxy but also the step-flow growth mechanism of other similar systems.

Abstract: The characterization of quantum correlations in many-body systems is instrumental to understanding the nature of emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The correlation entropy serves as a key metric for assessing the complexity of a quantum many-body state in interacting electronic systems. However, its determination requires the measurement of all single-particle correlators across a macroscopic sample, which can be impractical. Machine learning methods have been shown to allow learning the correlation entropy from a reduced set of measurements, yet these methods assume that the targeted system is contained in the set of training Hamiltonians. Here we show that a transfer learning strategy enables correlation entropy learning from a reduced set of measurements in families of Hamiltonians never considered in the training set. We demonstrate this transfer learning methodology in a wide variety of interacting models including local and non-local attractive and repulsive many-body interactions, long-range hopping, doping, magnetic field, and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we show how this transfer learning methodology allows detecting quantum many-body phases never observed during their training set without prior knowledge about them. Our results demonstrate that correlation entropy learning can be potentially performed experimentally without requiring training in the experimentally realized Hamiltonian.

# Improvement of Data Analytics Techniques in Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction to Enable Machine Learning

## 改进反射高能电子衍射中的数据分析技术以实现机器学习

**Authors:** Patrick T. Gemperline, Rajendra Paudel, Rama K. Vasudevan, Ryan B. Comes

arXiv:2501.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite oxides such as LaFeO$_3$ are a well-studied family of materials that possess a wide range of useful and novel properties. Successfully synthesizing perovskite oxide samples usually requires a significant number of growth attempts and a detailed film characterization on each sample to find the optimal growth window of a material. The most common real-time \textit{in situ} diagnostic technique available during molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) synthesis is reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Conventional use of RHEED allows a highly experienced operator to determine growth rate by monitoring intensity osciallations and make some qualitative observations during growth, such as recognizing the sample has become amorphous or recognizing that large islands have formed on the surface. However, due to a lack of theoretical understanding of the diffraction patterns, finer, more precise levels of observations are challenging. To address these limitations, we implement new data analytics techniques in the growth of three LaFeO$_3$ samples on Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ by MBE. These techniques improve our ability to perform unsupervised machine learning using principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering by using drift correction to overcome sample or stage motion during growth and intensity transformations that highlight more subtle features in the images such as Kikuchi bands. With this approach, we enable the first demonstration of PCA and k-means across multiple samples, allowing for quantitative comparison of RHEED videos for two LaFeO$_3$ film samples. These capabilities set the stage for real-time processing of RHEED data during growth to enable machine learning-accelerated film synthesis.

Abstract: Quantum nanostructures offer crucial applications in electronics, photonics, materials, drugs, etc. For accurate design and analysis of nanostructures and materials, simulations of the Schrodinger or Schrodinger-like equation are always needed. For large nanostructures, these eigenvalue problems can be computationally intensive. One effective solution is a learning method via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), together with ab initio Galerkin projection of the Schrodinger equation. POD-Galerkin projects the problem onto a reduced-order space with the POD basis representing electron wave functions (WFs) guided by the first principles in simulations. To minimize training effort and enhance robustness of POD-Galerkin in larger structures, the quantum element method (QEM) was proposed previously, which partitions nanostructures into generic quantum elements. Larger nanostructures can then be constructed by the trained generic quantum elements, each of which is represented by its POD-Galerkin model. This work investigates QEM-Galerkin thoroughly in multi-element quantum-dot (QD) structures on approaches to further improve training effectiveness and simulation accuracy and efficiency for QEM-Galerkin. To further improve computing speed, POD and Fourier bases for periodic potentials are also examined in QEM-Galerkin simulations. Results indicate that, considering efficiency and accuracy, the POD potential basis is superior to the Fourier potential basis even for periodic potentials. Overall, QEM-Galerkin offers more than a 2-order speedup in computation over direct numerical simulation for multi-element QD structures, and more improvement is observed in a structure comprising more elements.

Abstract: Establishing viable solid-state synthesis pathways for novel inorganic materials remains a major challenge in materials science. Previous pathway design methods using pair-wise reaction approaches have navigated the thermodynamic landscape with first-principles data but lack kinetic information, limiting their effectiveness. This gap leads to suboptimal precursor selection and predictions, especially for reactions forming competing phases with similar formation energies, where ion diffusion is a critical influence. Here, we demonstrate an inorganic synthesis framework by incorporating machine learning-derived transport properties through "liquid-like" product layers into a thermodynamic cellular reaction model. In the Ba-Ti-O system, known for its competitive polymorphism, we obtain accurate predictions of phase formation with varying BaO:TiO2 ratios as a function of time and temperature. We find that diffusion-thermodynamic interplay governs phase compositions, with cross-ion transport coefficients critical for predicting diffusion-limited selectivity. This work bridges length and time scales by integrating solid-state reaction kinetics with first-principles thermodynamics and spatial reactivity.

# Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine

arXiv:2409.07708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.

**Authors:** Kaiyan Li, Prabhat Kc, Hua Li, Kyle J. Myers, Mark A. Anastasio, Rongping Zeng

arXiv:2501.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging systems are commonly assessed and optimized by the use of objective measures of image quality (IQ). The performance of the ideal observer (IO) acting on imaging measurements has long been advocated as a figure-of-merit to guide the optimization of imaging systems. For computed imaging systems, the performance of the IO acting on imaging measurements also sets an upper bound on task-performance that no image reconstruction method can transcend. As such, estimation of IO performance can provide valuable guidance when designing under-sampled data-acquisition techniques by enabling the identification of designs that will not permit the reconstruction of diagnostically inappropriate images for a specified task - no matter how advanced the reconstruction method is or how plausible the reconstructed images appear. The need for such analysis is urgent because of the substantial increase of medical device submissions on deep learning-based image reconstruction methods and the fact that they may produce clean images disguising the potential loss of diagnostic information when data is aggressively under-sampled. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) approximated IOs (CNN-IOs) was investigated for estimating the performance of data space IOs to establish task-based performance bounds for image reconstruction, under an X-ray computed tomographic (CT) context. In this work, the application of such data space CNN-IO analysis to multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems has been explored. This study utilized stylized multi-coil sensitivity encoding (SENSE) MRI systems and deep-generated stochastic brain models to demonstrate the approach. Signal-known-statistically and background-known-statistically (SKS/BKS) binary signal detection tasks were selected to study the impact of different acceleration factors on the data space IO performance.

Abstract: We perform deep variational free energy calculations to investigate the dense hydrogen system at 1200 K and high pressures. In this computational framework, neural networks are used to model the free energy through the proton Boltzmann distribution and the electron wavefunction. By directly minimizing the free energy, our results reveal the emergence of a crystalline order associated with the center of mass of hydrogen molecules at approximately 180 GPa. This transition from atomic liquid to a molecular solid is marked by discontinuities in both the pressure and thermal entropy. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications and limitations of these findings in the context of recent studies of dense hydrogen under similar conditions.

Abstract: This review examines the current state of research on microscale cellular changes during the drying of plant-based food materials (PBFM), with particular emphasis on computational modelling approaches. The review addresses the critical need for advanced computational methods in microscale investigations. We systematically analyse experimental studies in PBFM drying, highlighting their contributions and limitations in capturing cellular-level phenomena, including challenges in data acquisition and measurement accuracy under varying drying conditions. The evolution of computational models for microstructural investigations is thoroughly examined, from traditional numerical methods to contemporary state-of-the-art approaches, with specific focus on their ability to handle the complex, nonlinear properties of plant cellular materials. Special attention is given to the emergence of data-driven models and their limitations in predicting microscale cellular behaviour during PBFM drying, particularly addressing challenges in dataset acquisition and model generalization. The review provides an in-depth analysis of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) frameworks, examining their theoretical foundations, current applications in related fields, and unique advantages in combining physical principles with neural network architectures. Through this comprehensive assessment, we identify critical gaps in existing methodologies, evaluate the trade-offs between different modelling approaches, and provide insights into future research directions for improving our understanding of cellular-level transformations during PBFM drying processes. The review concludes with recommendations for integrating experimental and computational approaches to advance the field of food preservation technology.

arXiv:2501.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is an enabling technology in many diagnostic and therapeutic tasks. Despite this, DIR algorithms have limited clinical use, largely due to a lack of benchmark datasets for quality assurance during development. To support future algorithm development, here we introduce our first-of-its-kind abdominal CT DIR benchmark dataset, comprising large numbers of highly accurate landmark pairs on matching blood vessel bifurcations. Abdominal CT image pairs of 30 patients were acquired from several public repositories as well as the authors' institution with IRB approval. The two CTs of each pair were originally acquired for the same patient on different days. An image processing workflow was developed and applied to each image pair: 1) Abdominal organs were segmented with a deep learning model, and image intensity within organ masks was overwritten. 2) Matching image patches were manually identified between two CTs of each image pair 3) Vessel bifurcation landmarks were labeled on one image of each image patch pair. 4) Image patches were deformably registered, and landmarks were projected onto the second image. 5) Landmark pair locations were refined manually or with an automated process. This workflow resulted in 1895 total landmark pairs, or 63 per case on average. Estimates of the landmark pair accuracy using digital phantoms were 0.7+/-1.2mm. The data is published in Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14362785. Instructions for use can be found at https://github.com/deshanyang/Abdominal-DIR-QA. This dataset is a first-of-its-kind for abdominal DIR validation. The number, accuracy, and distribution of landmark pairs will allow for robust validation of DIR algorithms with precision beyond what is currently available.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven methodology to learn a low-dimensional manifold of controlled flows. The starting point is resolving snapshot flow data for a representative ensemble of actuations. Key enablers for the actuation manifold are isometric mapping as encoder and a combination of a neural network and a k-nearest-neighbour interpolation as decoder. This methodology is tested for the fluidic pinball, a cluster of three parallel cylinders perpendicular to the oncoming uniform flow. The centres of these cylinders are the vertices of an equilateral triangle pointing upstream. The flow is manipulated by constant rotation of the cylinders, i.e. described by three actuation parameters. The Reynolds number based on a cylinder diameter is chosen to be 30. The unforced flow yields statistically symmetric periodic shedding represented by a one-dimensional limit cycle. The proposed methodology yields a five-dimensional manifold describing a wide range of dynamics with small representation error. Interestingly, the manifold coordinates automatically unveil physically meaningful parameters. Two of them describe the downstream periodic vortex shedding. The other three describe the near-field actuation, i.e. the strength of boat-tailing, the Magnus effect and forward stagnation point. The manifold is shown to be a key enabler for control-oriented flow estimation.

Abstract: Excited-state molecular dynamics (ESMD) simulations near conical intersections (CIs) pose significant challenges when using machine learning potentials (MLPs). Although MLPs have gained recognition for their integration into mixed quantum-classical (MQC) methods, such as trajectory surface hopping (TSH), and their capacity to model correlated electron-nuclear dynamics efficiently, difficulties persist in managing nonadiabatic dynamics. Specifically, singularities at CIs and double-valued coupling elements result in discontinuities that disrupt the smoothness of predictive functions. Partial solutions have been provided by learning diabatic Hamiltonians with phaseless loss functions to these challenges. However, a definitive method for addressing the discontinuities caused by CIs and double-valued coupling elements has yet to be developed. Here, we introduce the phaseless coupling term, $\Delta^2$, derived from the square of the off-diagonal elements of the diabatic Hamiltonian in the state-interaction state-averaged spin-restricted ensemble-referenced Kohn-Sham (SI-SA-REKS, briefly SSR)(2,2) formalism. This approach improves the stability and accuracy of the MLP model by addressing the issues arising from CI singularities and double-valued coupling functions. We apply this method to the penta-2,4-dieniminium cation (PSB3), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving MLP training for ML-based nonadiabatic dynamics. Our results show that the $\Delta^2$ based ML-ESMD method can reproduce ab initio ESMD simulations, underscoring its potential and efficiency for broader applications, particularly in large-scale and long-timescale ESMD simulations.

Abstract: Increasing HPC cluster sizes and large-scale simulations that produce petabytes of data per run, create massive IO and storage challenges for analysis. Deep learning-based techniques, in particular, make use of these amounts of domain data to extract patterns that help build scientific understanding. Here, we demonstrate a streaming workflow in which simulation data is streamed directly to a machine-learning (ML) framework, circumventing the file system bottleneck. Data is transformed in transit, asynchronously to the simulation and the training of the model. With the presented workflow, data operations can be performed in common and easy-to-use programming languages, freeing the application user from adapting the application output routines. As a proof-of-concept we consider a GPU accelerated particle-in-cell (PIConGPU) simulation of the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI). We employ experience replay to avoid catastrophic forgetting in learning from this non-steady process in a continual manner. We detail challenges addressed while porting and scaling to Frontier exascale system.

arXiv:2205.01493v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the inherent trade-off between accuracy and robustness in neural networks, drawing an analogy to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. We propose that neural networks are subject to an uncertainty relation, which manifests as a fundamental limitation in their ability to simultaneously achieve high accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. Through mathematical proofs and empirical evidence, we demonstrate that this trade-off is a natural consequence of the sharp boundaries formed between different class concepts during training. Our findings reveal that the complementarity principle, a cornerstone of quantum physics, applies to neural networks, imposing fundamental limits on their capabilities in simultaneous learning of conjugate features. Meanwhile, our work suggests that achieving human-level intelligence through a single network architecture or massive datasets alone may be inherently limited. Our work provides new insights into the theoretical foundations of neural network vulnerability and opens up avenues for designing more robust neural network architectures.

# VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems

**Authors:** Ziqing Xing, Zhaoyang Zhang, Zirui Chen, Yusong Wang, Haoran Ma, Zhun Wei

arXiv:2405.18731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.

Abstract: The detection of Dark Matter (DM) remains a significant challenge in particle physics. This study exploits advanced machine learning models to improve detection capabilities of liquid xenon time projection chamber experiments, utilizing state-of-the-art transformers alongside traditional methods like Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate various data representations and find that simplified feature representations, particularly corrected S1 and S2 signals as well as a few shape-related features including the time difference between signals, retain critical information for classification. Our results show that while transformers offer promising performance, simpler models like XGBoost can achieve comparable results with optimal data representations. We also derive exclusion limits in the cross-section versus DM mass parameter space, showing minimal differences between XGBoost and the best performing deep learning models. The comparative analysis of different machine learning approaches provides a valuable reference for future experiments by guiding the choice of models and data representations to maximize detection capabilities.

# Bayesian technique to combine independently-trained Machine-Learning models applied to direct dark matter detection

**Authors:** David Cerdeno, Martin de los Rios, Andres D. Perez

arXiv:2407.21008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out a Bayesian analysis of dark matter (DM) direct detection data to determine particle model parameters using the Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) machine learning technique. TMNRE avoids an explicit calculation of the likelihood, which instead is estimated from simulated data, unlike in traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This considerably speeds up, by several orders of magnitude, the computation of the posterior distributions, which allows to perform the Bayesian analysis of an otherwise computationally prohibitive number of benchmark points. In this article we demonstrate that, in the TMNRE framework, it is possible to include, combine, and remove different datasets in a modular fashion, which is fast and simple as there is no need to re-train the machine learning algorithm or to define a combined likelihood. In order to assess the performance of this method, we consider the case of WIMP DM with spin-dependent and independent interactions with protons and neutrons in a xenon experiment. After validating our results with MCMC, we employ the TMNRE procedure to determine the regions where the DM parameters can be reconstructed. Finally, we present CADDENA, a Python package that implements the modular Bayesian analysis of direct detection experiments described in this work.

arXiv:2410.23236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high energy physics, the ability to reconstruct particles based on their detector signatures is essential for downstream data analyses. A particle reconstruction algorithm based on learning hypergraphs (HGPflow) has previously been explored in the context of single jets. In this paper, we expand the scope to full proton-proton and electron-positron collision events and study reconstruction quality using metrics at the particle, jet, and event levels. Rather than operating on the entire event in a single pass, we train HGPflow on smaller partitions to avoid potentially learning long-range correlations related to the physics process. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible and that on most metrics, HGPflow outperforms both traditional particle flow algorithms and a machine learning-based benchmark model.

Abstract: Establishing viable solid-state synthesis pathways for novel inorganic materials remains a major challenge in materials science. Previous pathway design methods using pair-wise reaction approaches have navigated the thermodynamic landscape with first-principles data but lack kinetic information, limiting their effectiveness. This gap leads to suboptimal precursor selection and predictions, especially for reactions forming competing phases with similar formation energies, where ion diffusion is a critical influence. Here, we demonstrate an inorganic synthesis framework by incorporating machine learning-derived transport properties through "liquid-like" product layers into a thermodynamic cellular reaction model. In the Ba-Ti-O system, known for its competitive polymorphism, we obtain accurate predictions of phase formation with varying BaO:TiO2 ratios as a function of time and temperature. We find that diffusion-thermodynamic interplay governs phase compositions, with cross-ion transport coefficients critical for predicting diffusion-limited selectivity. This work bridges length and time scales by integrating solid-state reaction kinetics with first-principles thermodynamics and spatial reactivity.

# Data Efficient Molecular Image Representation Learning using Foundation Models

## 使用基础模型进行数据高效的分子图像表示学习

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2htdh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Anat, Milo

Deep learning (DL) in chemistry has made significant progress, yet its applicability is limited by the scarcity of large, labeled datasets and the difficulty of extracting meaningful molecular features. Recently, molecular representation learning (MRL) has emerged as a powerful approach to these challenges by decoupling feature extraction and property prediction. In MRL, a deep network is first trained to learn molecular features from large, unlabeled datasets and then finetuned for property prediction in smaller, specialized domains. The advent of foundation models, which are large models trained on diverse datasets capable of addressing various downstream tasks, has also transformed the field of DL. For example, large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 can be finetuned with minimal additional data for tasks considerably different from their training. While MRL methods have been widely applied across chemical applications, these models are typically trained from scratch on molecular data. This study proposes that foundation models can serve as an advantageous starting point for developing MRL models. We explore this idea by leveraging OpenAI's CLIP vision foundation model as the backbone for MoleCLIP, a molecular image representation learning framework. On standard benchmarks, MoleCLIP requires significantly less molecular pretraining data to match the performance of state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, MoleCLIP outperformed existing models on homogeneous catalysis datasets, emphasizing its robustness to distribution shifts, which allows it to adapt effectively to varied tasks and datasets. This successful application of a general foundation model to chemical tasks highlights the potential of innovations in DL research to advance synthetic chemistry and, more broadly, any field where molecular property description is central to discovery.

# Going beyond SMILES enumeration for generative deep learning  in low data regimes

## 在低数据状态下超越SMILES枚举，实现生成式深度学习

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fdnnq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Francesca, Grisoni

Data augmentation can alleviate the limitations of small molecular datasets for generative deep learning, by ‘artificially inflating’ the number of instances available for training. SMILES enumeration – whereby  multiple valid SMILES strings are used to represent the same molecules – has resulted particularly beneficial to improve the quality of de novo molecule design. Here, we investigate whether rethinking SMILES augmentation techniques could further enhance the quality of de novo design. To this end, we introduce four approaches for SMILES augmentation in de novo design, drawing inspiration from natural language processing and chemistry insights: (a) token deletion, (b) atom masking, (c) bioisosteric substitution, and (d) self-training. Via a systematic analysis, our results show the promise of considering additional strategies for SMILES augmentation. Every strategy showed distinct advantages, with atom masking resulting particularly promising to learn desirable physico-chemical properties in very low-data regimes. This new repertoire of SMILES augmentation strategies expands the available toolkit to design molecules with bespoke  properties in low-data scenarios.

**Authors:** Matthew, Clark

The integration of artificial intelligence technologies into pharmaceutical research is crucial for gaining an early understanding of molecular properties, thereby facilitating successful drug design. Constructing a machine learning (ML) model however, requires knowledge spanning from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model fine-tuning, posing a challenge for chemists to effectively utilize ML tools for drug property predictions. This paper introduces a model training engine (MTE), which is a scalable automated ML pipeline that supports end-to-end \textit{in silico} drug property prediction. To accelerate the training process, a paralleled model fine-tuning scheme is developed for model optimization and selection, reducing the time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n\times k)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n + k^2)$, where $ k >1$ and $k^2$ is much smaller than $n$. The MTE is benchmarked against five state-of-the-art models using twenty-two Therapeutic Data Commons ADMET datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the MTE across diverse molecular data prediction tasks.

# Unsupervised machine learning-based image recognition of raw IR spectra: Toward chemist-like chemical structural classification and beyond numerical data

## 基于无监督机器学习的原始红外光谱图像识别: 走向类似化学家的化学结构分类和超越数值数据

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-p6d7s-v5?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Kentarou, Fuku

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly improved spectral data analysis. In this study, we used unsupervised machine learning to classify chemical compounds based on infrared (IR) spectral images, without relying on prior chemical knowledge. The potential of machine learning for chemical classification was demonstrated by extracting IR spectral images from the Spectral Database for Organic Compounds and converting them into 208620-dimensional vector data. Hierarchical clustering of 230 compounds revealed distinct main clusters (A–G), each with specific subclusters exhibiting higher intracluster similarities. Despite the challenges, including sensitivity to spectral deviations and difficulty of distinguishing delicate chemical structures in spectra with low transparency in the fingerprint area, the proposed image recognition approach exhibits good potential. Both principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering produced similar results. Furthermore, the method demonstrated high robustness to noise. The Tanimoto coefficient was used to evaluate the molecular similarity, providing valuable insights. However, some results deviated from chemists’ intuitions. The study also highlighted that the scaling composition formulas and molecular weights did not affect the classification results because high-dimensional features dominated the process. A comparison of the clustering results obtained from molecular fingerprints, using the adjusted Rand index as a metric, indicated that the image data provided better classification performance than numerical data of the same resolution. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning with IR spectral image data for chemical classification and offers a novel perspective that complements traditional methods, although the classifications may not always align with chemists’ intuitions. This approach has broader implications for fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and automated spectral analysis, where handling large, raw spectral datasets is essential.

# Data-driven Insights on the Impact of Functionalization on Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) Free Energies

## 关于功能化对金属有机框架 (MOF) 自由能影响的数据驱动见解

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0z4tp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Remco, Chang

Functionalization is poised to play a prominent role in MOF development as it could become the to-go strategy to bestow extant MOF with new properties, and to control MOF pore shape and size by modulating polymorph selection. Thus, to speed up MOF development through computational work, a better (predictive) understanding on how functionalization impacts MOF synthesizability is needed. Here we use a data-driven approach where molecular dynamics simulations on 5,000+ MOFs are used to shed light on how functionalization affects MOF free energy, as the latter has been largely tied to MOF synthesizability and polymorph selection. More consistently in MOFs with higher void fractions, we find that functionalization generally reduces free energy, with entropy contributing significantly to this thermodynamic stabilization. Although with some functionalizations (-CF3, -F, -Br, -SH, -OH) the role of entropy is more apparent than with others (-CN, -CH3, -NO2, -NH3). Through uneven stabilization of polymorphs, we also find functionalization (more often with -Br, -CN and -CF3) as capable of altering polymorph (topology) selection relative to original non-functionalized polymorphic families. However, no switch in polymorph stability ever occurred when the original (unfunctionalized) polymorphs were separated by more than 1.42 kJ/mol per MOF atom. We show that machine learning can predict functionalization-induced free energy change of a parent MOF with a mean absolute error of 0.16 kJ/mol per atom, using only physical properties of the parent MOF and the functional group as input. The ML-based SHAP analysis agrees with human analysis on the functionalization molecular mass and the hydrogen fraction of the parent MOF being among the factors that influence change in free energy the most. Finally, we present a publicly accessible dynamic interface to visualize and navigate the free energy data , thereby encouraging the research community to engage with and utilize the data to help uncover new insights.

# AMUSET-TICA: A Tensor-Based Approach for Identifying Slow Collective Variables in Biomolecular Dynamics

## Amusiet-tica: 一种基于张量的方法，用于识别生物分子动力学中的慢集体变量

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-x8vwp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Xuhui, Huang

Elucidating Collective Variables (CVs) for biomolecular dynamics is crucial for understanding numerous biological processes. By leveraging the tensor-train data structure, a multilinear version of the AMUSE (Algorithm for Multiple Unknown Signals) algorithm for Koopman approximation (AMUSEt) was recently developed to identify CVs for biomolecular dynamics. To find slow CVs, AMUSEt transforms input features (e.g., pairwise atomic distances) into nonlinear basis functions (e.g., Gaussian functions) and encodes nonlinear basis functions within a tensor-train structure via the time-lagged correlation functions. Due to the need to fit these tensor-train data structures into computer memory, AMUSEt can handle only a limited number of input features. Consequently, AMUSEt relies on manually selecting and ranking features based on physical intuition to fully capture the slow dynamics. However, when applied to complex biological systems with numerous features, this selection and ranking process becomes increasingly challenging. To address this challenge, here we present AMUSET-TICA (AMUSEt-based Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis), a CV-identification method using time-structure-independent components (tICs) as the input features for AMUSEt. The key insight of AMUSET-TICA lies in its highly effective embedding of high-dimensional atomistic protein conformations, achieved by expanding orthogonal tICs into overlapping Gaussian basis functions through a tensor-product data structure. This eliminates the need for manually selecting and ranking input features for a wide range of biomolecular systems. We demonstrate that AMUSET-TICA consistently and significantly outperforms AMUSEt and tICA in identifying slow CVs for three different biomolecular systems: alanine dipeptide, the N-terminal domain of L9 (NTL9), and the FIP35 WW domain. For all these systems, the CVs generated by AMUSET-TICA accurately describe the slowest dynamical modes underlying these biological conformational changes. Furthermore, we show that AMUSET-TICA achieves performance comparable to deep-learning approaches like VAMPnets in identifying the slowest dynamical modes, while being significantly more computationally efficient in terms of CPU time. In addition, the CVs yielded by AMUSET-TICA provide insights into the folding mechanisms of NTL9 and the FIP35 WW domain, including CV3 and CV4 of the WW domain, which capture its two parallel folding pathways. We expect AMUSET-TICA can be widely applied to facilitate the investigation of biomolecular dynamics.

**Authors:** Mengyang, Gu

Block copolymers play a vital role in materials science due to their diverse self-assembly behavior. Traditionally, exploring the phase space of block copolymer self-assembly and associated structure-property re- lationships involves iterative synthesis, characterization, and theory, which is labor-intensive both experimentally and computationally. Here, we intro- duce a versatile, high-throughput workflow towards materials discovery that integrates controlled polymerization and automated chromatographic separa- tion with a novel physics-informed machine learning algorithm for the rapid analysis of small-angle X-ray scattering data. Leveraging the expansive and high-quality experimental datasets generated by fractionating polymers using automated chromatography, this machine learning method effectively reduces data dimensionality by extracting chemical-independent features from SAXS data. This new approach allows for the rapid and accurate prediction of mor- phologies without repetitive and time-consuming manual analysis, achieving out-of-sample predictive accuracy of around 95% for both novel and existing materials in the training dataset. By focusing on a subset of samples with large predictive uncertainty, only a small fraction of the samples needs to be inspected to further improve accuracy. Collectively, the synergistic combi- nation of controlled synthesis, automated chromatography, and data-driven analysis creates a powerful workflow that markedly expedites the discovery of structure-property relationships in advanced soft materials.

# Prognostic Model Identification of Ribosome Biogenesis-Related Genes in Pancreatic Cancer Based on Multiple Machine Learning Analyses

## 基于多重机器学习分析的胰腺癌核糖体生物合成相关基因预后模型识别

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5742961/latest

Background Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies within the digestive system, characterized by an extremely low five-year survival rate and formidable treatment challenges. Ribosome biogenesis is a core process in protein synthesis, essential for cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Tumors typically exhibit abnormally high proliferation rates, with ribosome biogenesis often being excessively activated in cancer cells to synthesize a significant quantity of proteins required for tumor development. In pancreatic cancer, enhanced ribosome biogenesis may be associated with tumor drug resistance and malignant phenotypes, presenting it as a potential therapeutic target. Therefore, exploring the molecular mechanisms of ribosome biogenesis in pancreatic cancer may uncover new biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets, facilitating the development of personalized treatment strategies.Methods Ribosome biogenesis-related gene signatures were obtained from the TCGA database and Gene Cards. Multiple machine learning methods were employed to screen prognostic gene sets closely related to survival, followed by the construction of a risk model. The GEO database was utilized for external validation of the model. The GSE155698 single-cell RNA sequencing dataset was analyzed to evaluate gene expression profiles and associated module scores.Results A total of 60 ribosome biogenesis-related prognostic genes in pancreatic cancer were identified. Through univariate Cox regression and various machine learning techniques, nine key prognostic genes (ECT2, CKB, HMGA2, TPX2, ERBB3, SLC2A1, KRT13, PRSS3, CRABP2) were selected as highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of PAAD patients. These genes demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. The risk score feature constructed based on machine learning was found to be an independent factor associated with high mortality, advanced clinical pathological features, and chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, this feature was closely related to cell proliferation and cancer progression-related pathways, suggesting its potential role in promoting pancreatic cancer development through enhanced ribosomal division, mitosis-related processes, and microtubule cytoskeleton organization. Furthermore, the feature was closely associated with immunosuppressive cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, indicating its role as a key immunosuppressive factor within the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed higher expression of CKB, SLC2A1, ERBB3, CRABP2, and PRSS3 in pancreatic ductal epithelial cells.Conclusions This study provides insights into the potential connections between ribosome biogenesis-related molecular characteristics and clinical features, the tumor microenvironment, and clinical drug responses. The research underscores the critical role of ribosome biogenesis in the progression and treatment resistance of pancreatic cancer, offering valuable new perspectives for prognostic evaluation and therapeutic response prediction in pancreatic cancer.

# Diet-SRNet: A Novel DieT Transformer-Based Model for Accurate Uterine Neoplasm Classification

## Diet-SRNet: 一种新的基于DieT Transformer的精确子宫肿瘤分类模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5820080/latest

Uterine tumors are atypical cell proliferations within the uterus. These tumors can be classified as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Rapid and accurate diagnosis and classification of uterine malignancies are essential for improving patient care and formulating successful treatment protocols. Medical imaging methods are critical for identifying uterine malignancies. However, achieving accurate diagnosis remains a hurdle. This study presents three uterine tumor CT image datasets (KAUH-UCCTD, KAHU-BUD, and KAUH-MUTD) collected at King Abdullah University Hospital in Jordan. The images were inspected and clustered by medical professionals. A novel image classification architecture called Diet-SRNet was developed. This model integrates advanced mechanisms based on transformers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to address the limitations of current methods. The infrastructure is designed to efficiently process CT scan data, incorporating self-attention mechanisms for global feature interactions and residual convolutional blocks (RCBs) to extract visual data and transform representations efficiently. The residual blocks include multiple convolutional layers, which enhance the model&amp;rsquo;s ability to capture local spatial relationships and improve the representation of hierarchical features. The self-attention mechanisms within the Diet-SRNet model play a pivotal role in enabling global feature pooling, which is essential for processing high-dimensional image data. These mechanisms compute the relationships between different image regions, allowing the model to focus on critical tumor features. Meanwhile, the residual convolutional blocks efficiently process low-level and mid-level features, enabling robust transformations that lead to more accurate classification of benign, malignant, and normal tumors. The Diet-SRNet architecture is further enhanced by local embedding layers, which enhance spatial representation, and a hybrid attention mechanism, which combines self-attention and residual connections. The developed model, named Diet-SRNet, demonstrated superior performance compared to eight pre-trained models DieT Transformer and ViT Transformer. Diet-SRNet achieved an accuracy of 88.10% on the uterine cancer CT dataset (KAUH-UCCTD), 91.72% on the benign uterine pathology dataset (KAUH-BUD), and 97.11% on the malignant uterine tumor dataset (KAUH-MUTD), outperforming all other trained models, confirming its effectiveness in staging uterine tumors on CT. The proposed strategy reduces the time required for manual diagnosis by helping clinicians quickly and accurately detect benign and malignant uterine tumors using CT data. In oncology, this is critical as it facilitates early intervention. Integrating Diet-SRNet into the clinical workflow can enhance radiologists' work's diagnostic efficiency and consistency.

In cognitive radio network, if cognitive user conflicts with primary user during the spectrum sensing, it should concede avoiding the effect of communication with primary user. The paper initiates a new sensing method using scatter information around mobile users to locate primary user. The multi-group TOA (Time of Arrival) and AOA (Angle of Arrival) provided by two base stations are measured based on the single reflect statistics channel model under NLOS environment. An innovative location algorithm, proposed in this paper, which combines neural network with the weighted centroid algorithm to achieve primary user&amp;rsquo;s location. The proposed algorithm can make great improvement on the location accuracy by effectively mitigating NLOS error in cognitive radio networks. Another contribution of the proposed algorithm is the benefit to the cognitive performance which can be characterized by the probability of spectrum coexistence. The results under different simulation circumstances illustrate that the current location algorithm improves detection performance and location performance to obtain more exact probability of spectrum coexistence.

# Advanced Sign Language Recognition Using Deep Learning: A Study on Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) with VGGNet and ResNet50 Models

## 使用深度学习的高级手语识别: 基于VGGNet和ResNet50模型的阿拉伯手语 (ArSL) 研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5822261/latest

Sign language is a vital communication tool for individuals with hearing impairments and those who do not speak the language of the host country. Despite its importance, sign language is not widely known and lacks universal patterns, with each country having its own unique set of signs influenced by local customs and traditions. This complexity presents significant challenges for computer vision-based recognition systems.

Currently, extensive research is being conducted to address the issues of sign language translation using advanced technologies. This paper introduces two novel datasets comprising 54,049 images of the ArSL-2018 (Arabic Sign Language) alphabet captured by over 40 contributors, alongside 15,200 images from proprietary datasets and digits sign language datasets. The images are meticulously categorized into 32 classes representing standard Arabic characters and processed through classification, normalization, and detection procedures using VGGNet model and ResNet50, designed to enhance the accurate recognition of hand gestures in real-time, even under complex background conditions. By leveraging deep learning and artificial intelligence, this system aims to bridge the communication gap between deaf and hearing individuals. The investigation delves into the comparison of the outcomes derived from two distinct training and testing regimes, one without fine-tuning and the other incorporating fine-tuning enhancements.


The remarkable levels of precision attained in contrast to prior research affirm the efficacy of this methodology. Particularly, the dataset encompassing ArSL alphabets exhibited accuracy rates of 99.05\%, 99.99\%, and 98.50\% when employing VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 Models, respectively, thus underscoring the efficiency of the proposed approach for hand gesture recognition tasks.

The non-university academic regulations for Basic Education establish reading aloud within the realm of language and literature as one of several activities that serve to create texts with a playful, artistic, and creative goal, as reading aloud texts forms the foundation for comprehensible and meaningful learning. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to research the competence of primary education teachers. The main objective of this work is to describe pauses and pitch changes as mechanisms for turn-taking. For that purpose, 150 bilingual Basque university students have been recorded and analysed reading aloud a brief narrative text. The results of the study demonstrate that they indeed use pauses as a strategy for role or turn changes, and in the statistical analysis, significant differences are observed, both in terms of frequency and in terms of duration, between orthographically marked pauses (T-pauses) and those that allow a role shift (P-pauses). Comparing the results of the present study with those of Bosch et al. (2005) the observations about reading aloud do not match, since this research shows that P-pauses are significantly longer than T-pauses. This elongation coincides with the role shift represented by the pauses. As a summary of what has been said, this study identifies the following sequences as the most common when reading aloud in Basque: HL[P]HL and H[T]H.

# HazeAway: A Convolutional Approach to Single-Image Haze Removal

## HazeAway: 一种单幅图像去雾的卷积方法

The existence of particles in the air cause haze, and this haze or fog cause degraded visibility in the captured shot from the camera. The non-uniform distribution of these particles, along with smoke, low light and pollution in the atmosphere, makes haze removal difficult in the real world images. The core computer vision tasks struggle with hazy images due to the lack of detail and poor visibility. The existing method relies on a transmission map in amalgamation with the atmospheric scattering input images to reconstruct a haze-free depiction. We suggested a single-image convolutions neural network that removes the haze present in the image and improves the perceptual quality by enhancing visibility. We used U-Net-like architecture with an encoder, bottleneck and decoder coupled with skip connections. In our experiment, we demonstrated the results on various benchmark dataset and compared our results with existing approaches. Additionally we compared the results from our network training on different image representations RGB verses YCbCr. The proposed method is straightforward and miniature yet still gives near state-of-the-art results.

# Neural Networks for Structured Grid Generation

Numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) on regular domains provide simplicity as we can rely on the structure of the space. We investigate a novel neural network (NN) - based approach to generate 2-dimensional body-fitted curvilinear coordinate systems (BFCs) that allow to stay on regular grids even when the complex geometry is considered. We describe a feed-forward neural network (FNN) as a geometric transformation that can represent a diffeomorphism under certain constraints and approximations, followed by the ways of training it to create BFCs. We show that the optimization system is similar to a physics informed neural network (PINN) based solution of Winslow equations. Unlike in classical BFC generation, FNN provides a differentiable mapping between spaces, and all the Jacobian matrices may be obtained exactly at any given point. Also, it allows to change an interior nodes distribution without the need of recreating the whole mapping.

# TrimNN: Characterizing cellular community motifs for studying multicellular topological organization in complex tissues

## TrimNN: 表征细胞群落基序以研究复杂组织中的多细胞拓扑组织

The spatial arrangement of cells plays a pivotal role in shaping tissue functions in various biological systems and diseased microenvironments. However, it is still under-investigated of the topological coordinating rules among different cell types as tissue spatial patterns. Here, we introduce the Triangulation cellular community motif Neural Network (TrimNN), a bottom-up approach to estimate the prevalence of sizeable conservative cell organization patterns as Cellular Community (CC) motifs in spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. Different from clustering cell type composition from classical top-down analysis, TrimNN differentiates cellular niches as countable topological blocks in recurring interconnections of various types, representing multicellular neighborhoods with interpretability and generalizability. This graph-based deep learning framework adopts inductive bias in CCs and uses a semi-divide and conquer approach in the triangulated space. In spatial omics studies, various sizes of CC motifs identified by TrimNN robustly reveal relations between spatially distributed cell-type patterns and diverse phenotypical biological functions.

# A physics informed neural network approach to quantify antigen presentation activities at single cell level using omics data

## 使用组学数据在单细胞水平上量化抗原呈递活动的物理通知神经网络方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5629379/latest

Antigen processing and presentation via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are central to immune surveillance. Yet, quantifying the dynamic activity of MHC class I and II antigen presentation remains a critical challenge, particularly in diseases like cancer, infection and autoimmunity where these pathways are often disrupted. Current methods fall short in providing precise, sample-specific insights into antigen presentation, limiting our understanding of immune evasion and therapeutic responses. Here, we present PSAA (PINN-empowered Systems Biology Analysis of Antigen Presentation Activity), which is designed to estimate sample-wise MHC class I and class II antigen presentation activity using bulk, single-cell, and spatially resolved transcriptomics or proteomics data. By reconstructing MHC pathways and employing pathway flux estimation, PSAA offers a detailed, stepwise quantification of MHC pathway activity, enabling predictions of gene-specific impacts and their downstream effects on immune interactions. Benchmarked across diverse omics datasets and experimental validations, PSAA demonstrates a robust prediction accuracy and utility across various disease contexts. In conclusion, PSAA and its downstream functions provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing the dynamics of MHC antigen presentation using omics data. By linking antigen presentation to immune cell activity and clinical outcomes, PSAA both elucidates key mechanisms driving disease progression and uncovers potential therapeutic targets.

# A histomorphological atlas of resected mesothelioma discovered by self-supervised learning from 3446 whole-slide images

## 通过自监督学习从3446的全幻灯片图像中发现的切除间皮瘤的组织形态学图谱

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5678715/latest

Mesothelioma is a highly lethal and poorly biologically understood disease which presents diagnostic challenges due to its morphological complexity. This study uses self-supervised AI (Artificial Intelligence) to map the histomorphological landscape of the disease. The resulting atlas consists of recurrent patterns identified from 3446 Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained images scanned from resected tumour slides. These patterns generate highly interpretable predictions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 0.65 concordance index (c-index) for outcomes and 85% AUC in subtyping. Their clinical relevance is endorsed by comprehensive human pathological assessment. Furthermore, we characterise the molecular underpinnings of these diverse, meaningful, predictive patterns. Our approach both improves diagnosis and deepens our understanding of mesothelioma biology, highlighting the power of this self-learning method in clinical applications and scientific discovery.

# Predicting Student Satisfaction in Career Choices Using Machine Learning: A Case Study

## 使用机器学习预测学生对职业选择的满意度: 案例研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5841034/latest

Student satisfaction is crucial for making successful educational and career choices. This study explores how artificial intelligence, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, can help predict student satisfaction with their university choices by considering socio-economic, environmental, and cultural factors. We analyzed data from 125 students at a technology university through three main steps: first, we assessed the reliability of a satisfaction measurement tool; second, we identified key factors influencing satisfaction through statistical analysis; and third, we applied an SVM model to predict satisfaction, using 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. Our results revealed significant positive correlations between student background, social support, prior knowledge, and their preference for group work with their overall satisfaction. The SVM model was able to predict satisfaction with an accuracy of 89%. These findings highlight the value of AI in educational guidance and suggest that the SVM model can effectively predict student satisfaction, as well as other factors critical to academic and career success.
