# DSMC: A Statistical Mechanics Perspective

## DSMC: 统计力学视角

**Authors:** Alejandro L. Garcia

arXiv:2501.07785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a perspective in which Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) is viewed not in its traditional role as an algorithm for solving the Boltzmann equation but as a numerical method for statistical mechanics. First, analytical techniques such as the collision virial and Green-Kubo relations, commonly used in molecular dynamics, are used to study the numerical properties of the DSMC algorithm. The stochastic aspect of DSMC, which is often viewed as unwanted numerical noise, is shown to be a useful feature for problems in statistical physics, such as Brownian motion and thermodynamic fluctuations. Finally, it is argued that fundamental results from statistical mechanics can provide guardrails when applying machine learning to DSMC.

Abstract: The pursuit of automated scientific discovery has fueled progress from symbolic logic to modern AI, forging new frontiers in reasoning and pattern recognition. Transformers function as potential systems, where every possible relationship remains latent potentiality until tasks impose constraints, akin to measurement. Yet, refining their sampling requires more than probabilistic selection: solutions must conform to specific structures or rules, ensuring consistency and the invocation of general principles. We present Graph-PReFLexOR (Graph-based Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning), a framework that combines graph reasoning with symbolic abstraction to dynamically expand domain knowledge. Inspired by reinforcement learning, Graph-PReFLexOR defines reasoning as a structured mapping, where tasks yield knowledge graphs, abstract patterns, and ultimately, final answers. Inspired by category theory, it encodes concepts as nodes and their relationships as edges, supporting hierarchical inference and adaptive learning through isomorphic representations. Demonstrations include hypothesis generation, materials design, and creative reasoning, such as discovering relationships between mythological concepts like 'thin places' with materials science. We propose a 'knowledge garden growth' strategy that integrates insights across domains, promoting interdisciplinary connections. Results with a 3-billion-parameter Graph-PReFLexOR model show superior reasoning depth and adaptability, underscoring the potential for transparent, multidisciplinary AI-driven discovery. It lays the groundwork for general autonomous reasoning solutions.

Abstract: High-entropy materials shift the traditional materials discovery paradigm to one that leverages disorder, enabling access to unique chemistries unreachable through enthalpy alone. We present a self-consistent approach integrating computation and experiment to understand and explore single-phase rock salt high-entropy oxides. By leveraging a machine-learning interatomic potential, we rapidly and accurately map high-entropy composition space using our two descriptors: bond length distribution and mixing enthalpy. The single-phase stabilities for all experimentally stabilized rock salt compositions are correctly resolved, with dozens more compositions awaiting discovery.

arXiv:2501.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to train ever-larger neural networks brings artificial intelligence to the forefront of scientific and technical discoveries. However, their exponentially increasing size creates a proportionally greater demand for energy and computational hardware. Incorporating complex physical events in networks as fixed, efficient computation modules can address this demand by decreasing the complexity of trainable layers. Here, we utilize ultrashort pulse propagation in multimode fibers, which perform large-scale nonlinear transformations, for this purpose. Training the hybrid architecture is achieved through a neural model that differentiably approximates the optical system. The training algorithm updates the neural simulator and backpropagates the error signal over this proxy to optimize layers preceding the optical one. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art image classification accuracies and simulation fidelity. Moreover, the framework demonstrates exceptional resilience to experimental drifts. By integrating low-energy physical systems into neural networks, this approach enables scalable, energy-efficient AI models with significantly reduced computational demands.

arXiv:2501.07765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding governing equations and boundary/initial conditions into the loss function. However, enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions accurately remains challenging, often leading to soft enforcement that compromises convergence and reliability in complex domains. We propose a hybrid approach, PINN-FEM, which combines PINNs with finite element methods (FEM) to impose strong Dirichlet boundary conditions via domain decomposition. This method incorporates FEM-based representations near the boundary, ensuring exact enforcement without compromising convergence. Through six experiments of increasing complexity, PINN-FEM outperforms standard PINN models, showcasing superior accuracy and robustness. While distance functions and similar techniques have been proposed for boundary condition enforcement, they lack generality for real-world applications. PINN-FEM bridges this gap by leveraging FEM near boundaries, making it well-suited for industrial and scientific problems.

# Is genuine nonlocality in the triangle network exclusive to pure states?

## 三角形网络中的真正非局部性是纯状态所独有的吗？

**Authors:** Anantha Krishnan Sunilkumar, Anil Shaji, Debashis Saha

arXiv:2501.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genuine network non-locality (GNN) refers to the existence of quantum correlations in a network with independent sources that cannot be explained by local hidden-variables (LHV) models. Even in the simplest scenario, determining whether these quantum correlations remain genuinely network non-local when derived from entangled states that deviate from their ideal forms is highly challenging due to the non-convex nature of local correlations. Understanding the boundary of these correlations thus becomes a hard problem, but one that raises academic interest specifically its robustness to noise. To address this problem, we introduce a causal domain-informed learning algorithm called the LHV k-rank neural network, which assesses the rank parameter of the non-ideal combined state produced by sources. Applied to the triangle network scenario with the three sources generating a class of quantum states known as X states, the neural network reveals that non-locality persists only if the states remain pure. Remarkably, we find that even slight deviations from ideal Bell states due to noise cause GNN to vanish, exhibiting a discrete behavior that hasn't been witnessed in the standard bell scenario. This finding thus raises a fundamental question as to whether GNN in the triangle network is exclusive to pure states or not. Additionally, we explore the case of the three sources producing dissimilar states, indicating that GNN requires all its sources to send pure entangled states with joint entangled measurements as resources. Apart from these results, this work succeeds in showing that machine learning approaches with domain-specific constraints can greatly benefit the field of quantum foundations.

Abstract: Based on machine learning techniques, we propose a novel method to estimate flow fields using only floating sensor locations. This method does not require either ground-truth velocity fields or governing equations for fluid flows, which is attractive for practical applications. The machine learning model in this method is supposed to generate accurate velocity fields so that the time variation of sensor motion is consistent with the given data of sensor locations. To validate the method, the estimation performance, the dependence on the number of sensors, and the robustness to noise are investigated using the two-dimensional forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence and the two-dimensional ocean currents. These investigations demonstrate the accuracy and the practicality of this method. Moreover, we observe that the present method can estimate the major structures, such as coherent structures in the forced turbulence and stable ocean currents, with only a few sensors. We believe the present method can provide effective utilisations of floating sensor observations in various fields.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.

Abstract: Tuning particle accelerators is a challenging and time-consuming task that can be automated and carried out efficiently using suitable optimization algorithms, such as model-based Bayesian optimization techniques. One of the major advantages of Bayesian algorithms is the ability to incorporate prior information about beam physics and historical behavior into the model used to make control decisions. In this work, we examine incorporating prior accelerator physics information into Bayesian optimization algorithms by utilizing fast executing, neural network models trained on simulated or historical datasets as prior mean functions in Gaussian process models. We show that in ideal cases, this technique substantially increases convergence speed to optimal solutions in high-dimensional tuning parameter spaces. Additionally, we demonstrate that even in non-ideal cases, where prior models of beam dynamics do not exactly match experimental conditions, the use of this technique can still enhance convergence speed. Finally, we demonstrate how these methods can be used to improve optimization in practical applications, such as transferring information gained from beam dynamics simulations to online control of the LCLS injector, and transferring knowledge gained from experimental measurements across different operating modes, such as accelerating different ion species at the ATLAS heavy ion accelerator.

Abstract: The global demand for unconventional energy sources such as geothermal energy and white hydrogen requires new exploration techniques for precise subsurface structure characterization and potential reservoir identification. The Magnetotelluric (MT) method is crucial for these tasks, providing critical information on the distribution of subsurface electrical resistivity at depths ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters. However, traditional iterative algorithm-based inversion methods require the adjustment of multiple parameters, demanding time-consuming and exhaustive tuning processes to achieve proper cost function minimization. Recent advances have incorporated deep learning algorithms for MT inversion, primarily based on supervised learning, and large labeled datasets are needed for training. This work utilizes TensorFlow operations to create a differentiable forward MT operator, leveraging its automatic differentiation capability. Moreover, instead of solving for the subsurface model directly, as classical algorithms perform, this paper presents a new deep unsupervised inversion algorithm guided by physics to estimate 1D MT models. Instead of using datasets with the observed data and their respective model as labels during training, our method employs a differentiable modeling operator that physically guides the cost function minimization, making the proposed method solely dependent on observed data. Therefore, the optimization algorithm updates the network weights to minimize the data misfit. We test the proposed method with field and synthetic data at different acquisition frequencies, demonstrating that the resistivity models obtained are more accurate than those calculated using other techniques.

Abstract: Jets clustered from heavy ion collision measurements combine a dense background of particles with those actually resulting from a hard partonic scattering. The background contribution to jet transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) may be corrected by subtracting the collision average background; however, the background inhomogeneity limits the resolution of this correction. Many recent studies have embedded jets into heavy ion backgrounds and demonstrated a markedly improved background correction is achievable by using neural networks (NNs) trained with aspects of jet substructure which are used to map measured jet $p_\mathrm{T}$ to the embedded truth jet $p_\mathrm{T}$. However, jet quenching in heavy ion collisions modifies jet substructure, and correspondingly biases the NNs' background corrections. This study investigates those biases by using simulations of jet quenching in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200\;\mathrm{GeV}/c$ with hydrodynamically modeled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) evolution. To demonstrate the magnitude of the effect of such biases in measurement, a leading jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) is calculated and reported using the NN background correction on jets quenched utilizing a brick of QGP.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient circuit models are necessary to control the power electronic circuits found on plasma physics experiments. Tuning and controlling the behavior of these circuits is inextricably linked to plasma performance. Linear models are greatly preferred for control applications due to their well-established performance guarantees, but they typically fail to capture nonlinear dynamics and changes in experimental parameters. Data-driven system identification can help mitigate these shortcomings by learning interpretable and accurate reduced-order models of a complex system, in this case the injector circuits of the Helicity Injected Torus - Steady Inductive Upgrade (HIT-SIU) experiment. Specifically, the Bagging Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition (BOP-DMD), is leveraged to learn stable, reduced order models of the interaction between the spheromak plasma formed in the confinement volume, and the injector circuits of the device. BOP-DMD is trained and evaluated on an analytic model of the vacuum dynamics of the injector circuits of HIT-SIU, as well as an analytic linear reduced-order model for the injector dynamics when a plasma is present. BOP-DMD is then fit on experimental data, both on shots with and without a plasma in the confinement volume. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of data-driven methods to produce stable, linear models for control and uncertainty quantification in plasma experiments.

arXiv:2405.18731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance.In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.

Background:Bone tumors (BT) are neoplasms that occur in the skeletal system or its affiliated tissues and can be categorized into primary and secondary malignant tumors. Currently, malignant bone tumors are associated with poor prognosis and high mortality rates. The central motivation for this scholarly research was to construct a mortality risk prediction model for BT patients.
Methods: In this study, data on BT patients traceable to Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) were utilized to predict the mortality risk of BT patients. A total of 3,061 adults participated in the study, and through ICD-9 and ICD-10, they were categorized into two groups. In order to assess the impact of potential confounders on outcome BT, This study selected some important variables as covariates. Then, identified through the proportional hazards (PH) assumption test, univariate Cox analysis, and machine learning. Subsequently, a nomogram was constructed and assessed.
Results: In this study, the subjects included 303 survivors and 82 deceased. An analysis of the two groups of subjects found that there were significant differences in 7 covariates, such as hemoglobin, sodium, and prothrombin time (PT). Further laboratory - index tests showed that there were significant differences in 11 covariates between the outcome - variable groups, among which were bicarbonate and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) scores. The results of the independent prognostic tests indicated that race, Simplified Acute Physiology II (SAPS II), platelets, blood sodium, and PT could serve as independent prognostic indicators for BT patients. Finally, based on these five independent prognostic factors, a nomogram with good predictive ability was constructed.
Conclusion: Based on five independent prognostic factors (race, Simplified Acute Physiology II (SAPS II), platelets, blood sodium, and PT), this study successfully constructed a nomogram with good predictive ability. It provided a valuable new perspective for understanding the model of predicting the in - hospital death risk of BT patients.

# A New Chapter after a Century of Journey: The Instructional Process and Community Involvement in Preprimary Schools

## 一个世纪的旅程后的新篇章: 学前教育的教学过程和社区参与

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5802993/latest

Preprimary education has become a primary focus of the Ethiopian education system. However, there is limited research on the implementation of government preprimary schools (O-Class), particularly regarding the teaching and learning processes and community participation. This study aims to investigate the instructional processes and community involvement in public preprimary schools within the Amhara National Regional State of Ethiopia. To achieve this objective, a convergent parallel mixed-method research design was employed. Data were collected from teachers, school principals, and district education officers through questionnaires, interviews, and observations. The results indicate that teachers employed various teaching strategies. Nonetheless, the findings highlighted common challenges in preprimary schools, including inadequate teaching and learning resources (both indoor and outdoor), an unfavorable learning environment, and insufficient community and parental involvement. The implementation of diverse teaching strategies amidst these challenges may be attributed to the presence of relatively qualified teachers. Based on the main findings of the study, it is recommended to place greater emphasis on the quality of preprimary education. This can be achieved through strong collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including communities (parents), local governments, and NGOs, to enhance access to teaching and learning resources and facilities and to create a conducive physical learning environment for children.

Background Renal dysfunction is a frequent complication after kidney transplantation, leading to poor prognosis and increased mortality. Abnormal blood lipids are closely related to renal dysfunction, yet their associations and mechanisms among renal transplant recipients remain unclear. This study aimed to establish an effective risk prediction model for renal dysfunction among RTRs based on abnormal lipid profiles using machine learning.Methods This retrospective cohort study recruited a cohort of 345 RTRs and followed up for one year after renal transplantation. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, including blood lipids, were retrieved from the electronic medical record system and analyzed using machine learning. Renal dysfunction was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;60 mL/min /1.73 m2. The cohort was randomly split into training (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;276) and validation (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;69) groups at a 4:1 ratio. Predictors of renal dysfunction were determined using three ML models: RandomForest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.Results During the one-year follow-up, 193 (55.9%) patients had renal dysfunction. A total of 20 demographic and clinical variables were selected to screen for significant predictors of renal dysfunction, and five were retained, including age, gender, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, and LDL-C, based on which a nomogram was developed. The nomogram showed good diagnostic performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 in the training group and 0.81 in the validation group.Conclusions Our study showed that preoperative lipid profiles predicted postoperative renal function among RTRs, based on which we developed a risk prediction model. The model can quickly identify high-risk RTRs with renal dysfunction, which is crucial for optimizing patient management and improving the prognosis.

# Document-level causal event extraction enhanced by temporal relation using dual-channel neural network

## 时间关系增强的双通道神经网络文档级因果事件提取

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5802602/latest

Event-event causal relation extraction (ECRE) represents a critical yet challenging task in natural language processing. Existing studies primarily focus on extracting causal sentences and events, despite the use of joint extraction methods for both tasks. However, both pipeline methods and joint extraction approaches often overlook the impact of document-level event temporal sequences on causal relationships. To address this limitation, we propose a model that incorporates document-level event temporal order information to enhance the extraction of implicit event causal relations. The proposed model comprises two channels: Event-event causal relation extraction channel (ECC) and event-event temporal relation extraction channel (ETC). Temporal features provide critical support for modeling node weights in the causal graph, thereby improving the accuracy of causal reasoning. Association link network (ALN) is introduced to construct event causality graph (ECG), incorporating an innovative design that computes node weights using Kullback-Leibler divergence and Gaussian kernels. Experimental results indicate that our model significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy and weighted average F1 scores.

# Proactive Detection of Cyber-Physical Grid Attacks: A Pre-Attack Phase Identification and Analysis Using Anomaly-Based Machine Learning Models

## 网络物理网格攻击的主动检测: 使用基于异常的机器学习模型的攻击前阶段识别和分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5828184/latest

Cyber-physical power systems (CPPS), such as smart grids, are increasingly vital to modern infrastructure but are also highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-attacks. Traditional security measures often detect these attacks only after significant damage has occurred, highlighting the need for proactive approaches that can identify potential threats before they fully manifest. This research presents a comprehensive investigation into the use of machine learning models for the early detection of cyber-attacks in a smart grid environment, with a particular focus on identifying pre-attack phases. We employed several unsupervised learning algorithms, including Isolation Forest, K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, and One-Class SVM, to analyze a time series dataset that simulates normal operations and various attack scenarios. Among these models, Isolation Forest demonstrated superior performance, achieving an Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 1.0, accuracy of 100%, and a sensitivity of 100% in detecting anomalies. DBSCAN also performed well, with an AUC of 0.79 and accuracy of 97.3%, although it exhibited a slightly higher false positive rate compared to Isolation Forest. To detect pre-attack phases, we focused on the anomaly scores generated by the Isolation Forest model. By adjusting the sensitivity threshold, we identified periods of abnormal behavior that precede actual attacks. A threshold of 0.3 for anomaly scores provided a balanced detection, revealing multiple pre-attack phases while maintaining a low false positive rate. However, a higher threshold of 0.97, while reducing false positives, resulted in the detection of fewer pre-attack phases, indicating that the attacks may occur more abruptly without significant pre-attack indicators. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning models in enhancing the security of cyber-physical systems by not only detecting attacks but also providing early warnings through the identification of pre-attack phases. This proactive approach could significantly mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure, offering a valuable tool for cybersecurity professionals in safeguarding these systems.

# SuperSalt: Equivariant Neural Network Force Fields for Multicomponent Molten Salts System

## SuperSalt: 多组分熔盐系统的等变神经网络力场

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5664807/latest

Molten salts are crucial for clean energy applications, yet exploring their thermophysical properties across diverse chemical spaces remains challenging. We present the development of a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) called SuperSalt, which targets 11-cation chloride melts and captures the essential physics of molten salts with near-DFT accuracy. Using an efficient workflow that integrates systems of one, two, and 11 components, the SuperSalt potential can accurately predict thermophysical properties such as density, bulk modulus, thermal expansion, and heat capacity. Our model is validated across a broad chemical space, demonstrating excellent transferability. We further illustrate how Bayesian optimization combined with SuperSalt can accelerate the discovery of optimal salt compositions with desired properties. This work provides a foundation for future studies that allows easy extensions to more complex systems, such as those containing additional elements. SuperSalt represents a shift towards a more universal, efficient, and accurate modeling of molten salts for advanced energy applications.

# IRMA: Machine learning-based harmonization of 18F-FDG PET brain scans in multi-center studies

## IRMA: 多中心研究中基于机器学习的18F-FDG PET脑扫描的协调

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5825843/latest

Purpose: Center-specific effects in PET brain scans arise due to differences in technical and procedural aspects. &amp;nbsp;This restricts the merging of data between centers and introduces source-specific bias. Methods: We demonstrate the use of the recently proposed machine learning method Iterated Relevance Matrix Analysis (IRMA) for harmonization of center-specific effects in brain 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET scans. The center difference is learned by applying IRMA on PCA-based feature vectors of healthy controls (HC), resulting in a subspace V, representing information not comparable between centers, and the remaining subspace U, where no center differences are present. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the properties of the method using data from four centers. After center-harmonization, a Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ) model was trained &amp;nbsp;to discriminate between Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Results: At the initial IRMA iteration, the system was able to determine the center origin of the four HC cohorts almost perfectly. The method required six iterations, corresponding to a six-dimensional subspace V, to determine the entire center difference. An uncorrected disease classification model was highly biased to center-specific effects, creating a falsely inflated performance when applying internal (cross-) validation. The cross-validation performance of the center-harmonized model remained high, while it generalized significantly better to unseen test cohorts. Furthermore, the framework is highly transparent, providing analytic reconstructions of the correction and visualizations &amp;nbsp;of the data in voxel space. Conclusion: IRMA can be used to learn and disregard center-specific information in features extracted from brain 18F-FDG PET scans, while retaining disease-specific information.

# GraphVelo allows for accurate inference of multimodal omics velocities and molecular mechanisms for single cells

## GraphVelo可以准确推断单细胞的多模态组学速度和分子机制

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5613372/latest

RNA velocities and generalizations emerge as powerful approaches for extracting time-resolved information from high-throughput snapshot single-cell data. Yet, several inherent limitations restrict applying the approaches to genes not suitable for RNA velocity inference due to complex transcriptional dynamics, low expression, or lacking splicing dynamics, or data of non-transcriptomic modality. Here, we present GraphVelo, a graph-based machine learning procedure that uses as input the RNA velocities inferred from existing methods and infers velocity vectors lying in the tangent space of the low-dimensional manifold formed by the single cell data. GraphVelo preserves vector magnitude and direction information during transformations across different data representations. Tests on multiple synthetic and experimental scRNA-seq data including viral-host interactome and multi-omics datasets demonstrate that GraphVelo, together with downstream generalized dynamo analyses, extends RNA velocities to multi-modal data and reveals quantitative nonlinear regulation relations between genes, virus and host cells, and different layers of gene regulation.

Credit card fraud has emerged as a pervasive threat, &amp;nbsp;impacting financial institutions and individuals as online &amp;nbsp;banking and payment methods become increasingly integral to &amp;nbsp;daily life. Despite efforts to mitigate this problem through &amp;nbsp;measures like passwords and two-factor authentication, &amp;nbsp;financial institutions continue to suffer substantial losses, often &amp;nbsp;amounting to millions of dollars. Traditional machine learning &amp;nbsp;solutions, developed and trained as supervised learning &amp;nbsp;models, have failed to address this issue effectively. In anomaly &amp;nbsp;detection, such as credit card fraud detection, the available &amp;nbsp;training datasets are vast but inherently imbalanced, posing a &amp;nbsp;formidable obstacle for supervised learning models in &amp;nbsp;developing accurate hypothesis functions during model &amp;nbsp;training. In response to this challenge, we propose an &amp;nbsp;alternative approach using unsupervised machine learning &amp;nbsp;models, specifically the Variational Autoencoder. In our study, &amp;nbsp;we constructed the Encoder and Decoder components of our &amp;nbsp;VAE using deep neural networks, implemented and trained &amp;nbsp;with pre-processed data using the TensorFlow and Keras &amp;nbsp;libraries. Our model's effectiveness was assessed using the &amp;nbsp;AUC-PR score, yielding a robust score of 88%. Additionally, &amp;nbsp;we subjected our model to an accuracy test on a test dataset, &amp;nbsp;achieving a commendable accuracy score of 78%. The results &amp;nbsp;of our study underscore the viability of unsupervised learning &amp;nbsp;models, particularly VAE, for credit card fraud detection, &amp;nbsp;demonstrating their potential as a machine learning solution to &amp;nbsp;mitigate credit card fraud. This research offers a promising &amp;nbsp;avenue for bolstering security measures in financial &amp;nbsp;transactions and reducing the impact of fraudulent activities.

The integration of deep learning in medical imaging has shown great promise for enhancing diagnostic, therapeutic, and research outcomes. However, applying universal models across multiple modalities remains challenging due to the inherent variability in data characteristics. This study aims to introduce and evaluate a Modality Projection Universal Model (MPUM). MPUM employs a novel modality-projection strategy, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its parameters to optimize performance across different imaging modalities. The MPUM demonstrated superior accuracy in identifying anatomical structures, enabling precise quantification for improved clinical decision-making. It also identifies metabolic associations within the brain-body axis, advancing research on brain-body physiological correlations. Furthermore, MPUM's unique controller-based convolution layer enables visualization of saliency maps across all network layers, significantly enhancing the model&rsquo;s interpretability.
