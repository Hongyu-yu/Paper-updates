# Revealing reaction kinetics in ammonium perchlorate (AP) combustion using an EM-HyChem approach

## 使用em-hychem方法揭示高氯酸铵 (AP) 燃烧中的反应动力学

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bb8dr?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Dongping, Chen

AP combustion is critical in the propulsion as its great ability to act as oxidizers in solid propellants. However, the reaction kinetics of AP remains under debate owing to the complex decomposition mechanism in solid phase. In this study, the reaction kinetics of AP is resolved by decoupling the complex combustion process into two sub-processes: solid-phase pyrolysis and gas-phase oxidation, which is recently proposed as EM-HyChem approach. In this approach, key pyrolysis products and reaction mechanisms are identified through molecular dynamics simulations. The chemical reaction neural network model is then employed to extract the rate parameters in pyrolysis model from thermogravimetric experiments. Subsequently, the pyrolysis model is coupled with an oxidation model for the pyrolysis products to build a kinetic model for AP. The kinetic model is used to simulate AP laminar flame via a one-dimensional method. Predicted burning rates, surface temperatures, and species profiles show good agreement with results from other experimental measurements and models. Sensitivity analysis of kinetic parameters provides insights into the factors contributing to the N-shaped curve of the AP burning rate.

# Emergence of molecular structures from repository-scale self-supervised learning on tandem mass spectra

## 从串联质谱上的库规模自监督学习中出现分子结构

**Authors:** Corinna, Brungs

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the primary method for characterizing biological and environmental samples at a molecular level. Despite this, the interpretation of tandem mass spectra from untargeted metabolomics experiments remains a challenge. Existing computational methods for predictions from mass spectra heavily rely on limited spectral libraries and on hard-coded human expertise. Here we introduce a transformer-based neural network pre-trained in a self-supervised way on millions of unannotated tandem mass spectra from our new GeMS (GNPS Experimental Mass Spectra) dataset mined from the MassIVE GNPS repository. We show that pre-training our model to predict masked spectral peaks and chromatographic retention orders leads to the emergence of rich representations of molecular structures, which we name DreaMS (Deep Representations Empowering the Annotation of Mass Spectra). Fine-tuning the pre-trained neural network to predict spectral similarity, molecular fingerprints, chemical properties, and the presence of fluorine from tandem mass spectra yields state-of-the-art performance across all the tasks. This underscores the practical utility of DreaMS across diverse mass spectrum interpretation tasks and establishes it as a stepping stone for future advances in the field. We make our new dataset and pre-trained models available to the community and release the DreaMS Atlas -- a molecular network of 201 million MS/MS spectra constructed using DreaMS annotations.

# Using Yield Fingerprints to Study Reaction Mechanism

Understanding reaction mechanisms can help to optimize efficiency, which allows industrially important molecules to be synthesized less expensively and more sustainably.  Determining mechanisms, however, can be time consuming and resource-intensive.  In this work, we outline an expeditious method to differentiate reaction mechanisms by means of unsupervised learning.  With this technique, reaction “fingerprints” are created from the yields of a set of substrates subjected to several different reaction conditions.  The resultant fingerprints are clustered by similarity to reveal mechanistic relationships.  We have benchmarked this method with elimination reaction mechanisms, and used it to explore mechanistic relationships among C–H activation, phenol cross coupling, and amination catalysts.  We determined that our method successfully categorizes elimination reaction mechanisms, as well as C–H activation reaction mechanisms between eCMD, CMD, and SEAr.  Additionally, we found that due to the swift progress and discovery of new mechanisms in the C–H activation field, much of the C–H activation literature contains outdated mechanistic labels.  Our method was able to correct these labels, and can be used to quickly hypothesize a mechanism for new C–H activation or amination catalysts with only 4-6 experiments.  We also predicted potential similarities in phenol oxidative cross coupling catalysts that are mechanistically not well understood.  Overall, this method has the potential to simplify the study of reaction mechanism for many types of reactions.

# Understanding the Mechanism of Nanocluster Formation from Machine-Learned Potential-based Simulations

## 从基于机器学习的电位模拟中理解纳米团簇形成的机制

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rkv0g?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Vikas, Tiwari

Understanding the mechanism for the formation of metal nanoclusters is an open challenge in the nanoscience field. Computational modeling can provide molecular details of nanocluster formation that are otherwise inaccessible. However, even with advanced computational resources, simulating the nucleation of a nanocluster in solution presents significant challenges, including inaccurate energy predictions and limitations on system size and timescale. This work addresses these challenges by integrating deep neural networks (DNN) with well-tempered metadynamics (WT-Metad) to model the nucleation of an Ag$_6$(SCNH$_2$)$_6$ (a prototypical example) in solution. An unbiased neural network potential (NNP)--based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation captured the cluster's dynamic behavior, while WT-Metad simulations revealed an almost barrierless downhill transition from dispersed precursors to a nucleated state. Scaling up the system to 30 randomly distributed precursors demonstrated spontaneous nucleation at multiple sites, underscoring the method's robustness. This study presents the first successful DNN model of nanocluster formation in solution with DFT-level accuracy, paving the way for advancements in the field.

# Optimizing EMS Response Times with Machine Learning: A Multivariate Analysis for Enhanced Resource Allocation

## 使用机器学习优化EMS响应时间: 增强资源分配的多变量分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5237650/latest

Background
This study examines the multifaceted determinants of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) response times through a machine learning approach. Using data from over one million EMS missions spanning 2017 to 2022, this research aims to understand and predict factors influencing response times, highlighting the role of machine learning in optimizing emergency services.
Methods
Advanced machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting models, were employed to analyze response times across various emergency scenarios. The data set was carefully curated to consider numerous factors such as urgency levels, call handling times, travel times, and geographical and temporal variables.
Results
The analysis confirms significant variability in response times influenced by factors such as the urgency of calls, weather conditions. Adverse weather and extreme temperatures were found to exacerbate response times significantly. Central urban areas showed faster response times compared to remote regions. The machine learning models effectively identified and quantified these impacts, offering a nuanced understanding that can inform more targeted EMS deployment strategies.
Conclusions
The findings advocate for the integration of real-time data on traffic, weather, and incident specifics into EMS resource allocation strategies to optimize response times dynamically. This approach underscores the importance of leveraging predictive analytics in emergency response planning, enhancing service delivery and patient outcomes. The study not only contributes to academic knowledge but also provides practical insights for emergency service administrators aiming to improve operational efficiency and response effectiveness.
