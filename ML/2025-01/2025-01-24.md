# Deep unsupervised clustering for prostate auto-segmentation with and without hydrogel spacer

## 用于具有和不具有水凝胶间隔物的前列腺自动分割的深度无监督聚类

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ada8f3

**Authors:** Hengrui Zhao, Biling Wang, Michael Dohopolski, Ti Bai, Steve Jiang and Dan Nguyen

Introduction. Clinical datasets for training deep learning (DL) models often exhibit high levels of heterogeneity due to differences such as patient characteristics, new medical techniques, and physician preferences. In recent years, hydrogel spacers have been used in some prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy to separate the prostate and the rectum to better spare the rectum while achieving adequate dose coverage on the prostate. However, this substantially affects the computed tomography image appearance, which downstream reduced the contouring accuracy of auto-segmentation algorithms. This leads to highly heterogeneous dataset. Methods. To address this issue, we propose to identify underlying clusters within the dataset and use the cluster labels for segmentation. We collected a clinical dataset of 909 patients, including those with two types of hydrogel spacers and those without. First, we trained a DL model to locate the prostate and limit our field of view to the local area surrounding the prostate and rectum. We then used Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and employed k-means clustering to assign each patient to a cluster. To leverage this clustered data, we propose a text-guided segmentation model, contrastive language and image pre-training (CLIP)-UNet, which encodes the cluster information using a text encoder and combines the encoded text information with image features for segmentation. Results. The UMAP results indicated up to three clusters within the dataset. CLIP-UNet with cluster information achieved a Dice score of 86.2% compared to 84.4% from the baseline UNet. Additionally, CLIP-UNet outperforms other state-of-the-art models with or without cluster information. Conclusion. Automatic clustering assisted by DL can reveal hidden data clusters in clinical datasets, and CLIP-UNet effectively utilizes clustered labels and achieves higher performance.

**Authors:** Ting Bao, Ning Mao, Wenhui Duan, Yong Xu, Adrian Del Maestro, Yang Zhang

arXiv:2501.12452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of density functional theory (DFT) with machine learning enables efficient \textit{ab initio} electronic structure calculations for ultra-large systems. In this work, we develop a transfer learning framework tailored for long-wavelength moir\'e systems. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we adopt a two-step transfer learning strategy: (1) the model is pre-trained on a large dataset of computationally inexpensive non-twisted structures until convergence, and (2) the network is then fine-tuned using a small set of computationally expensive twisted structures. Applying this method to twisted MoTe$_2$, the neural network model generates the resulting Hamiltonian for a 1000-atom system in 200 seconds, achieving a mean absolute error below 0.1 meV. To demonstrate $O(N)$ scalability, we model nanoribbon systems with up to 0.25 million atoms ($\sim9$ million orbitals), accurately capturing edge states consistent with predicted Chern numbers. This approach addresses the challenges of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, offering a viable alternative to conventional DFT and enabling the exploration of electronic topology in large scale moir\'e systems towards simulating realistic device architectures.

# Tensor cross interpolation approach for quantum impurity problems based on the weak-coupling expansion

**Authors:** Shuta Matsuura, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Philipp Werner, Naoto Tsuji

arXiv:2501.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm to solve equilibrium quantum impurity problems with high precision based on the weak-coupling expansion. The TCI algorithm, a kind of active learning method, factorizes high-dimensional integrals that appear in the perturbative expansion into a product of low-dimensional ones, enabling us to evaluate higher-order terms efficiently. This method is free from the sign problem which quantum Monte Carlo methods sometimes suffer from, and allows one to directly calculate the free energy. We benchmark the TCI impurity solver on an exactly solvable impurity model, and find good agreement with the exact solutions. We also incorporate the TCI impurity solver into the dynamical mean-field theory to solve the Hubbard model, and show that the metal-to-Mott insulator transition is correctly described with comparable accuracy to the Monte Carlo methods. Behind the effectiveness of the TCI approach for quantum impurity problems lies the fact that the integrands in the weak-coupling expansion naturally have a low-rank structure in the tensor-train representation.

arXiv:2501.12936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a universal and precise design framework is crucial to search high-performance catalysts, but it remains a giant challenge due to the diverse structures and sites across various types of catalysts. To address this challenge, herein, we developed a novel framework by the refined local atomic environment descriptors (i.e., weighted Atomic Center Symmetry Function, wACSF) combined with machine learning (ML), microkinetic modeling, and computational high-throughput screening. This framework is successfully integrated into the Digital Catalysis Database (DigCat), enabling efficient screening for 2e- water oxidation reaction (2e- WOR) catalysts across four material categories (i.e., metal alloys, metal oxides and perovskites, and single-atom catalysts) within a ML model. The proposed wACSF descriptors integrating both geometric and chemical features are proven effective in predicting the adsorption free energies with ML. Excitingly, based on the wACSF descriptors, the ML models accurately predict the adsorption free energies of hydroxyl ({\Delta}GOH*) and oxygen ({\Delta}GO*) for such a wide range of catalysts, achieving R2 values of 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Through density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling, a universal 2e- WOR microkinetic volcano model was derived with excellent agreement with experimental observations reported to date, which was further used to rapidly screen high-performance catalysts with the input of ML-predicted {\Delta}GOH*. Most importantly, this universal framework can significantly improve the efficiency of catalyst design by considering multiple types of materials at the same time, which can dramatically accelerate the screening of high-performance catalysts.

Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.

Abstract: We explore the interplay of quantum computing and machine learning to advance experimental protocols for observing measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in quantum devices. In particular, we focus on trapped ion monitored circuits and apply the cross entropy benchmark recently introduced by [Li et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 220404 (2023)], which can mitigate the post-selection problem. By doing so, we reduce the number of projective measurements -- the sample complexity -- required per random circuit realization, which is a critical limiting resource in real devices. Since these projective measurement outcomes form a classical probability distribution, they are suitable for learning with a standard machine learning generative model. In this paper, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn a representation of the measurement record for a native trapped-ion MIPT, and show that using this generative model can substantially reduce the number of measurements required to accurately estimate the cross entropy. This illustrates the potential of combining quantum computing and machine learning to overcome practical challenges in realizing quantum experiments.

Abstract: Although real-world complex systems typically interact through sparse and heterogeneous networks, analytic solutions of their dynamics are limited to models with all-to-all interactions. Here, we solve the dynamics of a broad range of nonlinear models of complex systems on sparse directed networks with a random structure. By generalizing dynamical mean-field theory to sparse systems, we derive an exact equation for the path-probability describing the effective dynamics of a single degree of freedom. Our general solution applies to key models in the study of neural networks, ecosystems, epidemic spreading, and synchronization. Using the population dynamics algorithm, we solve the path-probability equation to determine the phase diagram of a seminal neural network model in the sparse regime, showing that this model undergoes a transition from a fixed-point phase to chaos as a function of the network topology.

Abstract: We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.

Abstract: Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries, thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates l = 1 equivariant many-body interactions to enhance directional symmetric information in the message passing scheme. We provided a mathematical analysis demonstrating the necessity of incorporating many-body equivariant interactions and generalized the formulation to $N$-body interactions. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar and tensorial quantum chemical properties.

Abstract: Data assimilation plays a pivotal role in understanding and predicting turbulent systems within geoscience and weather forecasting, where data assimilation is used to address three fundamental challenges, i.e., high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, and partial observations. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based data assimilation methods have demonstrated encouraging results. In this work, we develop an ensemble score filter (EnSF) that integrates image inpainting to solve the data assimilation problems with partial observations. The EnSF method exploits an exclusively designed training-free diffusion models to solve high-dimensional nonlinear data assimilation problems. Its performance has been successfully demonstrated in the context of having full observations, i.e., all the state variables are directly or indirectly observed. However, because the EnSF does not use a covariance matrix to capture the dependence between the observed and unobserved state variables, it is nontrivial to extend the original EnSF method to the partial observation scenario. In this work, we incorporate various image inpainting techniques into the EnSF to predict the unobserved states during data assimilation. At each filtering step, we first use the diffusion model to estimate the observed states by integrating the likelihood information into the score function. Then, we use image inpainting methods to predict the unobserved state variables. We demonstrate the performance of the EnSF with inpainting by tracking the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) model dynamics under a variety of scenarios. The successful proof of concept paves the way to more in-depth investigations on exploiting modern image inpainting techniques to advance data assimilation methodology for practical geoscience and weather forecasting problems.

Abstract: Molecular orbital (MO) is one of the most fundamental concepts for molecules, relating to all branches of chemistry, while scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been widely recognized for its potential to measure the spatial distribution of MOs. However, the precise characterization of MO with high resolution in real space is a long-standing challenge owing to the inevitable interference of high-angular-momentum contributions from functionalized tips in STM. Here, leveraging advances in artificial intelligence for image recognition, we establish a physics-driven deep-learning network, named STM-Net, to reconstruct MOs from high-resolution STM images with a functionalized tip, taking advantage of the separable characteristics of different angular momentum contributions. We demonstrate that STM-Net can be directly applied to a variety of experimental observations, successfully reconstructing pristine MO features for molecules under diverse conditions. Moreover, STM-Net can adapt to various states of the functionalized tip and the substrate, illustrating the broad applicability of our physics-driven framework. These results pave the way for accurate characterization of MO with high resolution, potentially leading to new insights and applications for this fundamental concept in chemistry.

# An Implicit Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator for Long-term Predictions of Three-dimensional Turbulence

**Authors:** Yuchi Jiang, Zhijie Li, Yunpeng Wang, Huiyu Yang, Jianchun Wang

arXiv:2501.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term prediction of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows is one of the most challenging problems for machine learning approaches. Although some existing machine learning approaches such as implicit U-net enhanced Fourier neural operator (IUFNO) have been proven to be capable of achieving stable long-term predictions for turbulent flows, their computational costs are usually high. In this paper, we extend the adaptive Fourier neural operator (AFNO) from two-dimensional space to 3D space. Furthermore, we employ the implicit iteration to the AFNO and propose the implicit adaptive Fourier neural operator (IAFNO). IAFNO is systematically tested in three types of 3D turbulence, including forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), temporally evolving turbulent mixing layer and turbulent channel flow. The numerical results demonstrate that IAFNO is more accurate and stable than IUFNO and the traditional large-eddy simulation using dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM). Meanwhile, the AFNO model exhibits instability in numerical simulations. Moreover, the training efficiency of IAFNO is 4 times higher than that of IUFNO, and the number of parameters and GPU memory occupation of IAFNO are only 1/80 and 1/3 of IUFNO, respectively in HIT. In other tests, the improvements are slightly lower but still considerable. These improvements mainly come from patching and self-attention in 3D space. Besides, the well-trained IAFNO is significantly faster than the DSM.

arXiv:2501.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knotted molecules occur naturally and are designed by scientists to gain special biological and material properties. Understanding and utilizing knotting require efficient methods to recognize and generate knotted structures, which are unsolved problems in mathematics and physics. Here, we solve these two problems using machine learning. First, our Transformer-based neural network (NN) can recognize the knot types of given chain conformations with an accuracy of $>99\%$. We can use a single NN model to recognize knots with different chain lengths, and our computational speed is about 4500 times faster than the most popular mathematical method for knot recognition: the Alexander polynomials. Second, we for the first time design a diffusion-based NN model to generate conformations for given knot types. The generated conformations satisfy not only the desired knot types, but also the correct physical distributions of the radii of gyration and knot sizes. The results have several implications. First, the Transformer is suitable for handling knotting tasks, probably because of its strength in processing sequence information, a key component in knotting. Second, our NN can replace mathematical methods of knot recognition for faster speed on many occasions. Third, our models can facilitate the design of knotted protein structures. Lastly, analyzing how NN recognizes knot types can provide insight into the principle behind knots, an unsolved problem in mathematics. We provide an online website (http://144.214.24.236) for using our models.

Abstract: Low-frequency data are essential to constrain the low-wavenumber model components in seismic full-waveform inversion (FWI). However, due to acquisition limitations and ambient noise it is often unavailable. Deep learning (DL) can learn to map from high frequency model updates of elastic FWI to a low-wavenumber model update, producing an initial model estimation as if it was available from low-frequency data. We train a FusionNET-based convolutional neural network (CNN) on a synthetic dataset to produce an initial low-wavenumber model from a set of model updates produced by FWI on the data with missing low frequencies. We validate this DL-fused approach using a synthetic benchmark with data generated in an unrelated model to the training dataset. Finally, applying our trained network to estimate an initial low-wavenumber model based on field data, we see that elastic FWI starting from such a 'DL-fused' model update shows improved convergence on real-world marine streamer data.

arXiv:2501.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) band has recently garnered significant attention due to its exceptional capabilities in non-invasive, non-destructive sensing, and imaging applications. However, current THz imaging systems encounter substantial challenges owing to hardware limitations, which result in information loss and restricted imaging throughput during data digitization and information extraction processes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid compressive optical-digital neural network designed to facilitate both real-time THz imaging and precise object information extraction. This approach utilizes a physical encoder, an optical neural network (ONN), to transform and reduce the dimensionality of physical signals, effectively compressing them to fit the physical constraints of THz sensor arrays. After the compressed signals are captured and digitized by the THz sensor array, a jointly trained digital neural network (DNN) reconstructs the signals into their desired or original form. Our proposed THz ONN-DNN computational imaging system demonstrates enhanced imaging quality, an expanded field of view with a lens-free system, diffraction-free imaging capability, and real-time THz video capture at a rate of two frames per second.

Abstract: The unprecedented advancement of artificial intelligence has placed immense demands on computing hardware, but traditional silicon-based semiconductor technologies are approaching their physical and economic limit, prompting the exploration of novel computing paradigms. Memristor offers a promising solution, enabling in-memory analog computation and massive parallelism, which leads to low latency and power consumption. This manuscript reviews the current status of memristor-based machine learning accelerators, highlighting the milestones achieved in developing prototype chips, that not only accelerate neural networks inference but also tackle other machine learning tasks. More importantly, it discusses our opinion on current key challenges that remain in this field, such as device variation, the need for efficient peripheral circuitry, and systematic co-design and optimization. We also share our perspective on potential future directions, some of which address existing challenges while others explore untouched territories. By addressing these challenges through interdisciplinary efforts spanning device engineering, circuit design, and systems architecture, memristor-based accelerators could significantly advance the capabilities of AI hardware, particularly for edge applications where power efficiency is paramount.

Most importantly, this universal framework can significantly improve the efficiency of catalyst design by considering multiple types of materials at the same time, which can dramatically accelerate the screening of high-performance catalysts.

Such methods are well suited to help us learn about systems with unpredictable evolution or systems with ambiguous governing dynamics given our current understanding. Many plasma problems of interest fall into these categories as there are a wide range of models that exist, however each model is only useful in a certain regime and often limited by computational complexity. To ensure data-driven methods align with theory, they must be consistent and predictable when acting on data whose governing dynamics are known. Weak Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) is a recently developed data-driven method that has shown promise in learning governing dynamics from data with high noise levels [1]. This work examines how WSINDy acts on ideal MHD test problems as the initial conditions are varied and specifies limiting requirements for successful equation identification. It is hard to recover the governing dynamics from data that emphasize a single dominant behavior. In these low information cases, Shannon information entropy is able to pick up on the redundancies in the data that affect recoverability.

Abstract: To accelerate the scale-up of gaseous CO2 fermentation reactors, computational models need to predict gas-to-liquid mass transfer which requires capturing the bubble size dynamics, i.e. bubble breakup and coalescence. However, the applicability of existing models beyond air-water mixtures remains to be established. Here, an inverse modeling approach, accelerated with a neural network surrogate, calibrates the breakup and coalescence closure models, that are used in class methods for population balance modeling (PBM). The calibration is performed based on experimental results obtained in a CO2-air-water-coflowing bubble column reactor. Bayesian inference is used to account for noise in the experimental dataset and bias in the simulation results. To accurately capture gas holdup and interphase mass transfer, the results show that the breakage rate needs to be increased by one order of magnitude. The inferred model parameters are then used on a separate configuration and shown to also improve bubble size distribution predictions.

Abstract: Objective: Long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) positron emission tomography (PET) systems allow higher sensitivity, with an increased number of detected lines of response induced by a larger angle of acceptance. However this extend angle increase the number of multiple scatters and the scatter contribution within oblique planes. As scattering affects both quality and quantification of the reconstructed image, it is crucial to correct this effect with more accurate methods than the state-of-the-art single scatter simulation (SSS) that can reach its limits with such an extended field-of-view (FOV). In this work, which is an extension of our previous assessment of deep learning-based scatter estimation (DLSE) carried out on a conventional PET system, we aim to evaluate the DLSE method performance on LAFOV total-body PET.
  Approach: The proposed DLSE method based on an convolutional neural network (CNN) U-Net architecture uses emission and attenuation sinograms to estimate scatter sinogram. The network was trained from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of XCAT phantoms [18F]-FDG PET acquisitions using a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra scanner model, with multiple morphologies and dose distributions. We firstly evaluated the method performance on simulated data in both sinogram and image domain by comparing it to the MC ground truth and SSS scatter sinograms. We then tested the method on 7 [18F]-FDG and 7 [18F]-PSMA clinical datasets, and compare it to SSS estimations.
  Results: DLSE showed superior accuracy on phantom data, greater robustness to patient size and dose variations compared to SSS, and better lesion contrast recovery. It also yielded promising clinical results, improving lesion contrasts in [18 F]-FDG datasets and performing consistently with [18F]-PSMA datasets despite no training with [18F]-PSMA.

Abstract: In the present work, we collect solar irradiance and atmospheric condition data from several products, obtained from both numerical models (ERA5 and NORA3) and satellite observations (CMSAF-SARAH3). We then train simple supervised Machine Learning (ML) data fusion models, using these products as predictors and direct in-situ Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) measurements over Norway as ground-truth. We show that combining these products by applying our trained ML models provides a GHI estimate that is significantly more accurate than that obtained from any product taken individually. Using the trained models, we generate a 30-year ML-corrected map of GHI over Norway, which we release as a new open data product. Our ML-based data fusion methodology could be applied, after suitable training and input data selection, to any geographic area on Earth.

Abstract: Optimizing charged-particle track reconstruction algorithms is crucial for efficient event reconstruction in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments due to their significant computational demands. Existing track reconstruction algorithms have been adapted to run on massively parallel coprocessors, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), to reduce processing time. Nevertheless, challenges remain in fully harnessing the computational capacity of coprocessors in a scalable and non-disruptive manner. This paper proposes an inference-as-a-service approach for particle tracking in high energy physics experiments. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, two distinct tracking algorithms are tested: Patatrack, a rule-based algorithm, and Exa$.$TrkX, a machine learning-based algorithm. The as-a-service implementations show enhanced GPU utilization and can process requests from multiple CPU cores concurrently without increasing per-request latency. The impact of data transfer is minimal and insignificant compared to running on local coprocessors. This approach greatly improves the computational efficiency of charged particle tracking, providing a solution to the computing challenges anticipated in the High-Luminosity LHC era.

Abstract: The atomic spectra and structure of the open d- and f-shell elements are extremely complex, where tens of thousands of transitions between fine structure energy levels can be observed as spectral lines across the infrared and UV per species. Energy level quantum properties and transition wavenumbers of these elements underpins almost all spectroscopic plasma diagnostic investigations, with prominent demands from astronomy and fusion research. Despite their importance, these fundamental data are incomplete for many species. A major limitation for the analyses of emission spectra of the open d- and f-shell elements is the amount of time and human resource required to extract transition wavenumbers and intensities from the spectra. Here, the spectral line detection problem is approached by encoding the spectrum point-wise using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks, where transition wavenumber positions are decoded by a fully connected neural network. The model was trained using simulated atomic spectra and evaluated against experimental Fourier transform spectra of Ni ($Z=28$) covering 1800-70,000 cm$^{-1}$ (5555-143 nm) and Nd ($Z=60$) covering 25,369-32,485 cm$^{-1}$ (394-308 nm), measured under a variety of experimental set-ups. Improvements over conventional methods in line detection were evident, particularly for spectral lines that are noisy, blended, and/or distorted by instrumental spectral resolution-limited ringing. In evaluating model performance, a brief energy level analysis of Ni II using lines newly detected by the neural networks has led to the confident identification of two Ni II levels, $3\text{d}^8$$(^3\text{F}_4)6\text{f} [2]_{3/2}$ at 134,261.8946 $\pm$ 0.0081 cm$^{-1}$ and $3\text{d}^8$$(^3\text{F}_4)6\text{f} [1]_{3/2}$ at 134,249.5264 $\pm$ 0.0054 cm$^{-1}$, previously concluded to be unidentifiable using previously analysed Ni spectra.

Abstract: Trajectory adjustment decisions throughout the drilling process, called geosteering, affect subsequent choices and information gathering, thus resulting in a coupled sequential decision problem. Previous works on applying decision optimization methods in geosteering rely on greedy optimization or approximate dynamic programming (ADP). Either decision optimization method requires explicit uncertainty and objective function models, making developing decision optimization methods for complex and realistic geosteering environments challenging to impossible. We use the Deep Q-Network (DQN) method, a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method that learns directly from the decision environment, to optimize geosteering decisions. The expensive computations for RL are handled during the offline training stage. Evaluating DQN needed for real-time decision support takes milliseconds and is faster than the traditional alternatives. Moreover, for two previously published synthetic geosteering scenarios, our results show that RL achieves high-quality outcomes comparable to the quasi-optimal ADP. Yet, the model-free nature of RL means that by replacing the training environment, we can extend it to problems where the solution to ADP is prohibitively expensive to compute. This flexibility will allow applying it to more complex environments and make hybrid versions trained with real data in the future.

Abstract: Although real-world complex systems typically interact through sparse and heterogeneous networks, analytic solutions of their dynamics are limited to models with all-to-all interactions. Here, we solve the dynamics of a broad range of nonlinear models of complex systems on sparse directed networks with a random structure. By generalizing dynamical mean-field theory to sparse systems, we derive an exact equation for the path-probability describing the effective dynamics of a single degree of freedom. Our general solution applies to key models in the study of neural networks, ecosystems, epidemic spreading, and synchronization. Using the population dynamics algorithm, we solve the path-probability equation to determine the phase diagram of a seminal neural network model in the sparse regime, showing that this model undergoes a transition from a fixed-point phase to chaos as a function of the network topology.

Abstract: We develop a machine learning method for mapping data originating from both Standard Model processes and various theories beyond the Standard Model into a unified representation (latent) space while conserving information about the relationship between the underlying theories. We apply our method to three examples of new physics at the LHC of increasing complexity, showing that models can be clustered according to their LHC phenomenology: different models are mapped to distinct regions in latent space, while indistinguishable models are mapped to the same region. This opens interesting new avenues on several fronts, such as model discrimination, selection of representative benchmark scenarios, and identifying gaps in the coverage of model space.

# Deep Learning Framework for History Matching CO2 Storage with 4D Seismic and Monitoring Well Data

**Authors:** Nanzhe Wang, Louis J. Durlofsky

arXiv:2408.01575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geological carbon storage entails the injection of megatonnes of supercritical CO2 into subsurface formations. The properties of these formations are usually highly uncertain, which makes design and optimization of large-scale storage operations challenging. In this paper we introduce a history matching strategy that enables the calibration of formation properties based on early-time observations. Early-time assessments are essential to assure the operation is performing as planned. Our framework involves two fit-for-purpose deep learning surrogate models that provide predictions for in-situ monitoring well data and interpreted time-lapse (4D) seismic saturation data. These two types of data are at very different scales of resolution, so it is appropriate to construct separate, specialized deep learning networks for their prediction. This approach results in a workflow that is more straightforward to design and more efficient to train than a single surrogate that provides global high-fidelity predictions. The deep learning models are integrated into a hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) history matching procedure. History matching is performed on a synthetic case with and without 4D seismic data, which allows us to quantify the impact of 4D seismic on uncertainty reduction. The use of both data types is shown to provide substantial uncertainty reduction in key geomodel parameters and to enable accurate predictions of CO2 plume dynamics. The overall history matching framework developed in this study represents an efficient way to integrate multiple data types and to assess the impact of each on uncertainty reduction and performance predictions.

**Authors:** Da Bean, Han

Electronegativity can be considered a data-driven concept that is widely used since Pauling proposed
 this property. However, updating the electronegativity based on the vast amount of high quality
 experimental and computational data has been overlooked. Thus, advances in artificial intelligence
 (AI), with its ability to manage large datasets and identify underlying patterns, necessitate reconsid
ering data-driven concepts such as electronegativity. In this work, we present a data-driven method
 to generate more informative multidimensional electronegativity of organic molecules using graph
 neural networks. Focusing on two-dimensional electronegativity, we were able to do a more detailed
 classification of the atoms and their covalent bonds. By replacing the conventional electronegativity
 with the newly proposed one, we demonstrated the performance improvement in molecular machine
 learning tasks. We believe that our findings will be useful in understanding of electronegativity and
 chemical bonds by judiciously applying AI-driven methods to chemical studies.

**Authors:** Gisbert, Schneider

The rapid and economical synthesis of novel bioactive compounds remains a significant hurdle in drug discovery efforts. This study demonstrates an integrated medicinal chemistry workflow that effectively diversifies hit and lead structures, enabling an efficient acceleration of the critical hit-to-lead optimization phase. Employing high-throughput experimentation (HTE), we generated a comprehensive data set encompassing 13,490 novel Minisci-type C-H alkylation reactions. This data set served as the foundation for training deep graph neural networks to accurately predict reaction outcomes. Scaffold-based enumeration of potential Minisci reaction products, starting from moderate inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), yielded a virtual library containing 26,375 molecules. This virtual chemical library was evaluated using reaction prediction, physicochemical property assessment, and structure-based scoring, identifying 212 potential MAGL inhibitor candidates. Of these, 14 ligands were synthesized and exhibited subnanomolar activity, representing a potency improvement of up to 4500 times over the original hit compound. These compounds also displayed favorable pharmacological profiles. Co-crystallization of three computationally designed ligands with the MAGL protein provided valuable structural insights into their preferred binding poses. This study demonstrates the potential of combining miniaturized HTE with deep learning and molecular property optimization to reduce cycle times in drug discovery.

**Authors:** Edward C., Sherer

The design-make-test cycle for drug discovery is highly dependent on the purification of synthesized compounds. Prior to evaluation of suitability, ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography is used for an initial standard analysis, where retention times of analytes are measured with a shorter standard gradient method and used to select the appropriate gradients for a final purification method. To circumvent this preliminary screening experiment for small molecule libraries, retention time prediction had been achieved previously by use of commercial modeling methods. However, these retention time prediction models can have limited applicability when built from smaller datasets and are less effective when constructed from disparate data collected under differing chromatography conditions. Having thousands of measured retention times from high-throughput physiochemical screening, we sought to leverage these data for the construction of predictive models for a standard preliminary method enabling high-throughput purification of macrocyclic peptide libraries. Utilizing 4549 analytes and their retention times from high-throughput physiochemical screening, a structure to retention time model was built using a graph invariant network, a form of artificial neural network architecture. Once fitted to high-throughput screening data, the model was re-trained with standard gradient method data, a technique known as transfer learning. Through transfer learning, a training set of 80 analytes yielded a neural network model, that when evaluated against a test set of 24 analytes, displays high performance metrics with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.82 and mean average error of 0.088 minutes, or 1.26% of the gradient time. This model has been deployed internally as a dash-app to help democratize the use of the developed models and is being used for selecting purification methods based on analyte structure.

**Authors:** Peter,  R. Schreiner

Multifidelity methods in machine learning (ML) have seen an increasing usage for the prediction of quantum chemical properties. These methods, such as ∆-ML and multifidelity ML, have been shown to significantly reduce the computational cost of generating training data. This work implements and analyzes several multifidelity methods including ∆-ML and multifidelity ML for the prediction of electronic molecular energies at DLPNO-CCSD(T) level, i.e., at the level of coupled cluster theory including single and double excitations and perturbative triples corrections. The models for small organic molecules are evaluated not only on the basis of accuracy of prediction, but also on efficiency in terms of the time-cost of generating training data. In addition, the models are evaluated for the prediction of energies for molecules sampled from a public dataset, in particular for atmospherically relevant molecules, isomeric compounds, and highly conjugated complex molecules.

**Authors:** Gemma C., Solomon

The properties and dynamics of gold nanowires have been studied for decades as an important testbed for several physical phenomena. Gold nanowires forming at contacts are an integral part of molecular junctions used to study the electronic and thermal properties of single molecules. However, the huge discrepancy in timescales between experiments and simulations, compounded by the limited accuracy of classical force fields, has posed a challenge in accurately simulating realistic junctions. Here we show that machine-learning force fields reveal new behaviors not captured by classical force fields when modeling Au-Au pulling junctions. Our simulations show a dependency of the average breaking distance on the pulling speed, highlighting a more complex behavior than previously thought. Our results demonstrate that the use of more accurate force fields to simulate metallic nanowires is essential to capture the complexity of their structural evolution in break junction experiments. Our developments advance the modeling accuracy of molecular junctions, bridging the gap between experimental and simulation timescales.

**Authors:** Jackson, Barnes

Cationic micelles, composed of amphiphilic block copolymers with polycationic coronas, offer a customizable platform for mRNA delivery. Here, we present a library of 30 cationic micelle nanoparticles (MNPs) formulated from diblock copolymers with reactive poly(pentafluorophenol acrylate) backbones modified with a diverse set of amines. This library systematically varies in nitrogen-based cationic functionalities, exhibiting a spectrum of properties that encompass varied degrees of alkyl substitution (A1-A5), piperazine (A6), oligoamine (A7), guanidinium (A8), hydroxylation (A9-A10) that vary in sidechain volume, substitution pattern, hydrophilicity, and pKa to assess parameter impact on mRNA delivery. In vitro delivery assays using GFP+ mRNA across multiple cell lines reveal that amine sidechain bulk and chemical structure critically affect performance. Using machine learning analysis via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) on 3,780 experimental data points, we mapped key relationships between amine chemistry and performance metrics, finding that amine-specific binding efficiency was a major determinant of mRNA delivery efficacy, cell viability, and GFP intensity. Micelles with stronger mRNA binding capabilities (A1 and A7) have higher cellular delivery performance, whereas those with intermediate binding tendencies deliver a higher amount of functional mRNA per cell (A2 and A10). This indicates that balancing the binding strength is crucial for performance. Micelles with hydrophobic and bulky pendant groups (A3, A4, and A5) tend to induce necrosis during cellular delivery, highlighting the significance of chemical optimization. A cationic amphiphile identified as A7 displaying a primary and secondary amine, consistently demonstrates the highest GFP expression across various cell types and in vivo achieving high delivery specificity to lung tissue upon intravenous administration. Moreover, we established a strong correlation between in vitro and in vivo performance using Multitask Gaussian Process models, linking amine properties directly to both delivery efficacy and biodistribution. This correlation underscores the predictive power of in vitro models for anticipating in vivo outcomes and highlights chemical amine-dependent optimization as crucial for advancing mRNA delivery vehicle development. Overall, this innovative study integrates advanced data science with experimental design demonstrating the pivotal role of chemical amine identity for targeted mRNA delivery to the lungs.

**Authors:** Eashaal , Mahmood

The ongoing threat of global warming necessitates a shift towards clean energy sources to meet rising demands while reducing carbon emissions. Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) represent a promising technology for both mobile and stationary applications but their poor operational lifetimes and frequent faults are barriers to their commercial ubiquity. Thus, detecting and addressing faults rapidly is crucial to extend PEFC lifetimes and enhance their viability for alternative electricity generation. White-box and black-box models are widely used to diagnose PEFC faults; this work introduces a novel black-box approach using multifrequency Walsh function perturbation signals to diagnose polymer electrolyte membrane PEFC faults. This method improves signal-to-noise ratios in the electrical response of the fuel cell, increasing measurement accuracies without causing cell damage from excessive perturbation amplitudes. Using the voltage response of the PEFC as the diagnostic variable, dense neural networks (DNNs), 1-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) were investigated for fault classification. Initial testing revealed that all models could accurately detect normal, drying, and starvation conditions in an individual PEFC, with the 1D-CNN and SVMs achieving 100% diagnostic accuracy. When tested on data from a different PEFC, the models exhibited poor generalisation abilities; nevertheless, combining data from multiple PEFCs significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, with the 1D-CNN displaying superior generalisation performance, particularly when trained with only a small portion of new data. The network’s convolutional architecture facilitates effective parameter sharing and local connectivity, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing errors. Thus, it emerges as the most suitable model for the diagnostic framework, capable of managing varying datasets from different PEFCs while maintaining high accuracies.

**Authors:** Rowan, Matney

Native ion mobility-mass spectrometry combined with collision-induced unfolding (CIU) is a powerful analytical  method for protein characterization, offering insights into structural stability, and enabling the differentiation of analytes of similar mass and mobility. A surface induced dissociation (SID) device was recently commercialized, enabling broader adoption of SID measurements and surface induced folding (SIU). This study evaluates SIU, benchmarking its reproducibility and performance against CIU on a Waters CyclicIMS ion mobility-mass spectrometer. Reproducibility studies were conducted on model proteins, including β-lactoglobulin (β-lac), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ). SIU and CIU exhibited comparable reproducibility, with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values averaging less than 4% across multiple charge states. Notably, SIU achieved unfolding transitions at lower activation thresholds, enhancing sensitivity to subtle structural differences and providing additional analytical information content such as unique high arrival time unfolding features and additional unfolding transitions. Furthermore, the differentiation of closely related protein subclasses, such as IgG1κ and IgG4κ, was improved with SIU, as evidenced by the f enhancement of supervised machine learning models for IgG subclass classifications. SIU-trained models outperformed or matched CIU-trained models, achieving high cross-validation accuracies (>90%) and robust classifications of biotherapeutics Adalimumab and Nivolumab. This work establishes SIU as a complementary and efficient alternative to CIU, offering improved sensitivity, and analytical depth without loss in reproducibility. This work highlights the benefits of including SIU in protein characterization workflows, particularly in high-throughput and machine learning-guided applications.

# Aboveground biomass estimation using multimodal remote sensing observations and machine learning in mixed temperate forest

## 基于多模态遥感观测和机器学习的温带混交林地上生物量估算

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5713585/latest

Plants sequester carbon in their aboveground components, making aboveground tree biomass a key metric for assessing forest carbon storage. Traditional methods of aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation via Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots lack sufficient sampling intensity to directly produce accurate estimates at fine granularities. Increasing the sampling intensity with additional FIA plots would be labor and time intensive, particularly for large-scale carbon studies. Utilizing remote sensing (RS) data, such as Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), aerial imagery, and satellite images can significantly enhance the efficiency of forest carbon monitoring efforts. The principal objective of this study is to utilize the random forest (RF) algorithm to build predictive AGB models. We utilized 67 explanatory variables, which were extracted from three RS sources resulting in nine RF models. Each RF model was subjected to variable selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The optimum model considered 28 explanatory variables, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 27.19 Mgha&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1 and R2 of 0.41. Combining LiDAR with image metrics increased the accuracy of prediction models, serving as a pivotal tool for large area biomass mapping and carbon related decision making.

# Prediction of intraoperative haemorrhage in oral cancer reconstruction: A retrospective cohort study

## 口腔癌重建术中出血的预测: 一项回顾性队列研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5215896/latest

Background Despite surgery is the recommended treatment for oral cancer patients, little is known about intraoperative blood loss in this population. This study sought to identify risk factors for intraoperative haemorrhage in oral cancer resection and free flap reconstruction surgery, and to develop a machine learning-based predictive model.Methods This retrospective cohort study included patients with oral cancer who underwent resection and fibular flap reconstruction at a tertiary hospital. Demographic and clinical parameters were selected using a Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm. The final model for further analysis was selected after considering precision, accuracy, and area under the curve.Results A total of 452 individuals who had surgery for oral cancer met the criteria, with 179 individuals (39.6%) experiencing intraoperative hemorrhage, which results in higher inpatient expenses and longer durations of stay. Subsequently, 11 of 47 variables were picked for machine learning model building. In comparison, Random Forest had the highest area under the curve (AUC) (0.835, 95% CI 0.773&amp;ndash;0.898), precision, and accuracy. Further feature importance evaluation and Shapley additive explanation analysis revealed that hemoglobin, surgical duration, total bilirubin, leucocyte count, tumor size, albumin, and Charlson comorbidity index score were significant risk factors for intraoperative bleeding. A nomogram algorithm utilizing the factors listed above was used to interpret and predict the possibility of operative hemorrhage Individualized for patients undergoing oral cancer resection and free flap reconstructive surgery.Conclusions Hemoglobin, surgical duration, total bilirubin, leucocyte count, tumor size, albumin, and Charlson comorbidity index score proved to be significant predictors of intraoperative hemorrhage, and Random Forest can be applied to predict the possibility of bleed loss in oral cancer resection and free flap reconstruction surgery. This study helped provide a more adequate preoperative evaluation, blood preparation for patients, and optimal blood resource utilization.

# Balancing Standardization and Flexibility in National Complex Intervention Scale-Up: A Qualitative Study of Leadership Experiences and Management in the Implementation of Proactive Health Support (PaHS) in Denmark

## 在国家复杂干预规模扩大中平衡标准化和灵活性: 丹麦实施主动健康支持 (PaHS) 的领导经验和管理的定性研究

Background Policymakers increasingly aim to expand small-scale healthcare interventions to a national level to maximize reach and impact. However, scaling complex interventions presents challenges, particularly in balancing national standardization with flexibility in local implementation across contexts. This study investigates how leaders experience and manage the national implementation of Proactive Health Support, a large-scale self-management support intervention in Denmark.Methods The study employed a single-case study design with embedded units to examine the national implementation of the Proactive Health support intervention. Data were collected through 10 semi-structured interviews with leaders from the five Danish regions, more than 25 hours of participant observations of leadership meetings and workshops, and document analysis of 468 pages of leadership meeting minutes and reports.Results Implementing Proactive Health Support required leaders to balance the tension between fidelity and adaptation within a standardized framework. While the national framework provided stability, leaders leveraged the flexibility of implementation strategies to preserve the core intervention components while enabling local adjustments to fit diverse contexts. Reflexive practices&amp;mdash;characterized by real-time adjustments and positive feedback loops&amp;mdash;were pivotal for balancing standardization with flexibility.  Vertical leadership mediated alignment between national and regional levels, while horizontal collaboration fostered shared learning across regions.Conclusion This study demonstrates the complexity of scaling healthcare interventions across diverse contexts, underscoring such processes' non-linear and dynamic nature and the significant ongoing, real-time leadership engagement required to navigate complexity and manage uncertainty. It highlights collaborative leadership as crucial for enabling real-time responsiveness, fostering alignment across levels, and balancing fidelity and adaptation in national implementations. The findings empirically demonstrate that fidelity and adaptation are not opposing forces but complementary in practice, with adaptation in implementation strategies supporting fidelity by allowing interventions to be applied meaningfully across diverse contexts.  The findings further suggest that successful national implementation relies not on strict adherence to standardized guidelines but on a co-adaptive process within a standardized yet flexible framework, where intervention and context are co-constructed through ongoing, leadership-driven negotiation.Trial registration: The implementation was studied as part of a multidisciplinary research program. The study is a follow-on study to a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03628469).

In the era of pervasive digital communication, SMS spam poses significant threats, including financial fraud and phishing attacks, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This paper introduces a novel hybrid model for SMS spam detection, leveraging advanced deep-learning techniques to capture diverse textual features comprehensively. The model integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local feature extraction, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for sequential dependencies, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for contextual embeddings. A parallel architecture combines these components to achieve a holistic representation of SMS content. Fused feature vectors undergo attention-based selection to enhance computational efficiency while preserving critical information. Evaluated on the UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy, the proposed model achieves a remarkable accuracy of 99.68%, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. This work addresses the limitations of traditional and hybrid methods, offering a highly reliable and adaptable solution to the evolving challenges of SMS spam detection.

# Dependency Tree-Integrator Method for Reducing Mislaid Data Errors in Water Demand Prediction

## 减少需水预测中错放数据错误的依赖树-积分器方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5327092/latest

The water supply demand has grown significantly high par with the increase in population, activities, manufacturing, etc. in recent years. A wide range of research on water demand forecasts based on the accumulated statistical data is formulated to ensure sufficient recommendations on required water supply. Considering these facts, the problem of mislaid water data statistics impacting prediction accuracy is addressed here. This article proposes a Dependency Tree-Integrator Method (DTIM) using linear XGBoost learning to address the aforementioned issue. The proposed method generates two linear dependency trees based on the increasing order of water utilization and equivalent demand from the daily data collected. The presence of mislaid data breaks the linearity of the dependency tree, where classification is performed. This classification differentiates the demand and utilization to regularize the demand. The regularized inputs are integrated to forecast the difference in previous and current utilizations as demands. The dependency tree and the classification processes form the integrity of the linear XGBoost learning. The dependency tree fails if the linearity is interrupted by the mislaid data input that is identified as an error and the differentiation occurs. Through real-time data and statistical analysis, the proposed method&amp;rsquo;s efficacy is verified using accuracy, precision, mean error, and complexity metrics. Thus proposed DTI method improves prediction precision and accuracy by 11.23% and 11.87% under the different quarters considered.

# Pose Scoring Model for Refining Multi-Person Poses

## 用于细化多人姿势的姿势评分模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5054149/latest

In multi-person pose estimation, the coordinates of body joints are estimated to predict the body poses of several people in an image. Although significant progress has been made in this area in recent years, the solutions still suffer from certain weaknesses. One weakness is the detection of a larger number of poses than the actual number of human instances in the image. To face this problem, the final poses are often selected by thresholding the detected human scores. This, however, is not optimal because a pose with a lower priority may be assigned a higher score and selected as the final pose. In this paper, we introduce a problem, explain the reason, and present a pose scoring model as a solution. This model predicts the confidence score for the pose based on the human image, the location and the confidence score of the joints and the structure between the joints of the body. We formulate the problem using Conditional Random Fields and introduce suitable potential functions. To infer the best pose score, we design a neural network whose inputs are a human image and an initial pose. To train the model, a lot of training data and corresponding labels should be provided. For this purpose, we introduce Monte Carlo and GAN-based data augmentation methods, and a scoring function to train the model. Also, we investigate the effect of the pose scores on the reliability and accuracy of multi-person pose estimation models. The proposed idea is implemented as a deep neural network and can be easily applied to other multi-person pose estimation models as a model-agnostic method. In addition to the usual pose estimation evaluation metrics, we consider the number of poses to compare the models in terms of reliability. Experiments show that the performance of the proposed model is higher than the state-of-the-art models. Conducting further research can help to simplify and reduce the complexity of the model.

# Stress prediction for slopes based on the VMD-DBO-GRU-A model

## 基于vmd-dbo-gru-a模型的边坡应力预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5846462/latest

The stability of open-pit mine slopes is a complex nonlinear system. Stress variation is a significant influencing factor in the occurrence of landslide disasters and is also a key research focus in landslide early warning and risk assessment.However, traditional methods are confronted with challenges, including low prediction accuracy and poor robustness when dealing with nonlinear time series data. In order to address the aforementioned issues, the present paper proposes an intelligent prediction model based on Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Dung Beetle Optimization (DBO), combined with an improved Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is hereby referred to as the VMD-DBO-GRU-A model.The preliminary preprocessing of open pit mine slope stress data using VMD can provide high decomposition accuracy and can effectively extract localized features in the stress; The method introduces Dung Beetle Optimization (DBO) to determine the number of hidden neuron layers and the optimal learning rate for the GRU. This reduces the uncertainty of model parameters and minimizes the time required for parameter tuning; Self-attention mechanism is also added to assign different weights to the input features, which reduces the dependence on external information and is more adept at capturing the internal relevance of the data or features. In order to verify the validity of the model, experiments are conducted on a self-constructed stress dataset in this paper. The experimental results show that the root-mean-square error of the VMD-DBO-GRU-A model has decreased by 77% and 84% compared with the LSTM and SVM models, respectively, and the coefficient of determination is 0.9978, which fully verifies that the VMD-DBO-GRU-A model has an excellent comprehensive performance and high prediction accuracy, which is of great value for the practical application of landslide early warning for open-pit mines&rsquo; slopes.
