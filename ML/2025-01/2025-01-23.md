# Characterizing out-of-distribution generalization of neural networks: application to the disordered Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model

## 表征神经网络的分布外泛化: 在无序su-schrieffer-heeger模型中的应用

Machine learning (ML) is a promising tool for the detection of phases of matter. However, ML models are also known for their black-box construction, which hinders understanding of what they learn from the data and makes their application to novel data risky. Moreover, the central challenge of ML is to ensure its good generalization abilities, i.e. good performance on data outside the training set. Here, we show how the informed use of an interpretability method called class activation mapping, and the analysis of the latent representation of the data with the principal component analysis can increase trust in predictions of a neural network (NN) trained to classify quantum phases. In particular, we show that we can ensure better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the complex classification problem by choosing such an NN that, in the simplified version of the problem, learns a known characteristic of the phase. We also discuss the characteristics of the data representation learned by a network that are predictors of its good OOD generalization. We show this on an example of the topological Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model with and without disorder, which turned out to be surprisingly challenging for NNs trained in a supervised way. This work is an example of how the systematic use of interpretability methods can improve the performance of NNs in scientific problems.

# Deep-learning-based canopy height model generation from sub-meter resolution panchromatic satellite imagery

## 基于深度学习的亚米分辨率全色卫星图像树冠高度模型生成

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ada47e

**Authors:** Charles J Abolt, Javier E Santos, Adam L Atchley, Lucas Wells, Daithi Martin, Russell A Parsons and Rodman R Linn

Canopy height models (CHMs) with sufficient resolution to distinguish individual trees are useful for a variety of applications. However, standard techniques to acquire such data, such as airborne lidar surveying, are often prohibitively expensive. Deep learning techniques for generating CHMs from high-resolution imagery are an attractive option to reduce costs. To date, success with these methods has been demonstrated using multichannel aerial photography and specialized satellite data products derived from multiple sensors, neither of which is commonly available at temporal resolutions finer than one year. Here we demonstrate a method to generate sub-meter resolution CHMs in three forests in California using a more abundant data source: sub-meter resolution, panchromatic satellite imagery from a single sensor. We show that phenology and species composition play important roles in model transferability; when trained using imagery from a single conifer forest in autumn, the model performs well on autumn imagery from a second conifer forest several hundred kilometers distant with no re-training. With modest additions to the training dataset, the same model generates minimally biased estimates of canopy height in both conifer and deciduous forests during multiple seasons. Because the model operates on satellite data with global coverage and a relatively short return interval, we propose its suitability to extrapolate tree-level canopy height data to remote regions and conduct high-temporal resolution monitoring of forest structure. We furthermore demonstrate the workflow’s applicability to fire modeling by conducting simulations in forests populated by trees measured using both this approach and airborne lidar surveying. We find minimal differences in fire behavior relative to a baseline case in which only statistical distributions of tree height and crown area are known. This result underscores the value of forest structural information derived from our workflow for improving the fidelity of wildland fire simulations, among other ecological applications.

# A reinforcement learning approach to the design of quantum chains for optimal energy and state transfer

## 用于优化能量和状态转移的量子链设计的强化学习方法

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ada71d

**Authors:** S Sgroi, G Zicari, A Imparato and M Paternostro

We propose a bottom–up approach, based on reinforcement learning, to the design of a chain achieving efficient excitation-transfer performances. We assume distance-dependent interactions among particles arranged in a chain under tight-binding conditions. Starting from two particles and a localised excitation, we gradually increase the number of constitutents of the system so as to improve the transfer probability. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal locations and numbers of particles as a Markov decision process: we use proximal policy optimization to find the optimal chain-building policies and the optimal chain configurations under different scenarios. We consider both the case in which the target is a sink connected to the end of the chain and the case in which the target is the right-most particle in the chain. We address the problem of disorder in the chain induced by particle positioning errors. We apply our methodology to a simplified model of a relevant physical platform, consisting of trapped ions. We are able to achieve extremely high excitation transfer in all cases, with different chain configurations and properties depending on the specific conditions.

arXiv:2501.11019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A current challenge in atomistic machine learning is that of efficiently predicting the response of the electron density under electric fields. We address this challenge with symmetry-adapted kernel functions that are specifically derived to account for the rotational symmetry of a three-dimensional vector field. We demonstrate the equivariance of the method on a set of rotated water molecules and show its high efficiency with respect to number of training configurations and features for liquid water and naphthalene crystals. We conclude showcasing applications for relaxed configurations of gold nanoparticles, reproducing the scaling law of the electronic polarizability with size, up to systems with more than 2000 atoms. By deriving a natural extension to equivariant learning models of the electron density, our method provides an accurate and inexpensive strategy to predict the electrostatic response of molecules and materials.

**Authors:** Zuoyong Zhang, Chuang Deng

arXiv:2501.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) segregation is a powerful approach for optimizing the thermal and mechanical properties of metal alloys. In this study, we report significant GB interstitial segregation in a representative substitutional binary alloy system (Al-Ni) through atomistic simulations, challenging prevailing assumptions in the literature. Our findings show that Ni atoms preferentially segregate to interstitial sites within numerous kite-like GB structures in the Al bicrystals. An intriguing interplanar interstitial segregation pattern was also observed and analyzed. Additionally, interstitial segregation can induce unexpected GB transitions, such as kite transitions and nano-faceting, due to the existence of small interstitial sites. Building upon these observations, we developed a robust method to systematically identify the interstitial candidate sites for accommodating solutes at GBs. This approach combines site detection with structural filtering to produce distributions of interstitial sites that closely match atomistic simulation results. Applied to nanocrystalline alloys, this method enabled the calculation of interstitial segregation energies, significantly improving GB segregation predictions for the Al-Ni system. Furthermore, machine learning models using smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptors successfully predicted per-site interstitial segregation energy. This study highlights the critical role of GB interstitial segregation in advancing our understanding of solute behavior and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation alloys.

arXiv:2501.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of surface states and their exchange gaps in magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) thin films is crucial for achieving robust topological Chern and Axion insulating phases where the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect and the Topological Magneto-electric Effect can be realized. Here, we focus on the rather unexplored issue of how surface reconstructions, which are likely to occur in experiments, influence these properties. Using first-principles calculations together with molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by machine learning force field, we demonstrate that interstitial-2H and peripheral-2H type atomic reconstructions are responsible for modifying the exchange gap and surface characteristics of MBT thin films, with important implications for the topological indices and the nature of quasi one-dimensional side-wall edge states dominating quantum transport. \textcolor{blue}{Specifically, the calculation of the energy landscape and barriers for the proposed surface reconstructions indicates that the interstitial-2H reconstruction is thermodynamically more stable than the peripheral-2H reconstruction. The latter case is also hypothesized as providing a plausible explanation for the Rashba surface states observed} in Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Our analysis provides a theoretical framework to elucidate the nature and effect of reconstructions in MBT thin films, with predictions for the experimental realization of different topological phases.

arXiv:2501.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images are often corrupted by noise, hindering their interpretation. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based approach using simulated images. Using density functional theory calculations with a set of pseudo-atomic orbital basis sets, we generate highly accurate ground truth images. We introduce four types of noise into these simulations to create realistic training datasets. Each type of noise is then used to train a separate convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our results show that these CNNs are effective in reducing noise, even when applied to images with different noise levels than those used during training. However, we observe limitations in some cases, particularly in preserving the integrity of circular shapes and avoiding visible artifacts between image patches. To overcome these challenges, we propose alternative training strategies and future research directions. This study provides a valuable framework for training deep learning models for TEM image denoising.

Abstract: Construction of transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials with a minimal number of parameters is important for their general applicability. Here, we present a machine-learning interatomic potential with the functional form of the bond-order potential for comprehensive exploration over the configuration space of carbon. The physics-based design of this potential enables robust and accurate description over a wide range of the potential energy surface with a small number of parameters. We demonstrate the versatility of this potential through validations across various tasks, including phonon dispersion calculations, global structure searches for clusters, phase diagram calculations, and enthalpy-volume mappings of local minima structures. We expect that this potential can contribute to the discovery of novel carbon materials.

arXiv:2501.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.

arXiv:2501.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-stuffed B-C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure have captured increasing attention due to their predicted exceptional superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure. However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing studies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweight system. Here, using state-of-the-art *ab initio* methods incorporating quantum effects and machine learning potentials, we revisit the properties of a series of $XY\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ clathrates where $X$ and $Y$ are metals. Our findings show that ionic quantum and anharmonic effects can harden the $E_g$ and $E_u$ vibrational modes, enabling the dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable in the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously unreported $(XY)^{1+}$ state, which is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high critical temperatures. Further calculations based on the isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation demonstrate that the $T_c$ values for $\text{KRbB}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ and $\text{RbB}_{3}\text{C}_{3}$ among these stabilized compounds are 87 and 98 K at 0 and 15 GPa, respectively, both being higher than $T_c$ of 77 K of $\text{KPbB}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ at the anharmonic level. These record-high $T_c$ values, surpassing liquid nitrogen temperatures, emphasize the importance of anharmonic effects in stabilizing B-C clathrates with large electron-phonon coupling strength and advancing the search for high-$T_c$ superconductivity at (near) ambient pressure.

arXiv:2501.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique properties of plastic crystals highlight their potential for use in solid-state refrigeration. However, their practical applications are limited by thermal hysteresis due to low thermal conductivity. In this study, the effect of compressive strain on the thermal transport properties of plastic crystal [(CH3)4N][FeCl4] was investigated using molecular dynamic simulation with a deep neural network potential. It is found that a 9% strain along [001] direction enhances thermal conductivity sixfold. The underlying mechanisms are analyzed through vibrational density of states, spectral energy densities, and mean square displacements. The enhancement in thermal conductivity is primarily due to increased group velocity and reduced phonon scattering, driven by volume compression within the 0-1 THz. These findings offer theoretical insights for the practical application of plastic crystals in thermal management systems.

The actor-critic is implemented using neural networks; a particular innovation in our method is the use of an additional neural policy for processing memory variables. We demonstrate results for current fluctuations in various memory-dependent models with special focus on semi-Markov systems where the dynamics is controlled by nonexponential interevent waiting time distributions.

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex material inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of mechanical behavior is investigated to evaluate the impact on the predictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To demonstrate this, stress-strain curves were used to predict key microstructural features of porous materials, and the performance of models trained with and without domain knowledge was compared using five deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forest. The results of the models with domain-specific characteristics consistently achieved higher $R^2$ values and improved learning efficiency compared to models without prior knowledge. When the models did not include domain knowledge, the model results revealed meaningful patterns were not recognized, while those enhanced with mechanical insights showed superior feature extraction and predictions. These findings underscore the critical role of domain knowledge in guiding deep learning models, highlighting the need to combine domain expertise with data-driven approaches to achieve reliable and accurate outcomes in materials science and related fields.

Abstract: We present MOFA, an open-source generative AI (GenAI) plus simulation workflow for high-throughput generation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) systems. MOFA addresses key challenges in integrating GPU-accelerated computing for GPU-intensive GenAI tasks, including distributed training and inference, alongside CPU- and GPU-optimized tasks for screening and filtering AI-generated MOFs using molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo simulations. These heterogeneous tasks are unified within an online learning framework that optimizes the utilization of available CPU and GPU resources across HPC systems. Performance metrics from a 450-node (14,400 AMD Zen 3 CPUs + 1800 NVIDIA A100 GPUs) supercomputer run demonstrate that MOFA achieves high-throughput generation of novel MOF structures, with CO$_2$ adsorption capacities ranking among the top 10 in the hypothetical MOF (hMOF) dataset. Furthermore, the production of high-quality MOFs exhibits a linear relationship with the number of nodes utilized. The modular architecture of MOFA will facilitate its integration into other scientific applications that dynamically combine GenAI with large-scale simulations.

Abstract: Class imbalance (CI) is a longstanding problem in machine learning, slowing down training and reducing performances. Although empirical remedies exist, it is often unclear which ones work best and when, due to the lack of an overarching theory. We address a common case of imbalance, that of anomaly (or outlier) detection. We provide a theoretical framework to analyze, interpret and address CI. It is based on an exact solution of the teacher-student perceptron model, through replica theory. Within this framework, one can distinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic, train or test imbalance. Our analysis reveals that the optimal train imbalance is generally different from 50%, with a non trivial dependence on the intrinsic imbalance, the abundance of data and on the noise in the learning. Moreover, there is a crossover between a small noise training regime where results are independent of the noise level to a high noise regime where performances quickly degrade with noise. Our results challenge some of the conventional wisdom on CI and offer practical guidelines to address it.

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is probably the most promising approach for quantum chemistry calculations considering its good balance between calculations precision and speed. In recent years, several neural network-based functionals have been developed for exchange-correlation energy approximation in DFT, DM21 developed by Google Deepmind being the most notable between them. This study focuses on evaluating the efficiency of DM21 functional in predicting molecular geometries, with a focus on the influence of oscillatory behavior in neural network exchange-correlation functionals. We implemented geometry optimization in PySCF for the DM21 functional in geometry optimization problem, compared its performance with traditional functionals, and tested it on various benchmarks. Our findings reveal both the potential and the current challenges of using neural network functionals for geometry optimization in DFT. We propose a solution extending the practical applicability of such functionals and allowing to model new substances with their help.

Abstract: While Bernal stacked bilayer graphene bears two distinct atom types in its lattice, there exists no analytical framework addressing the number of atomic environments that emerge in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices. Here, we computationally analyze 140 different twisted bilayer superlattices using descriptor functions to study the emergent local environments. Our study reveals that the number of atoms with unique local environments depend on the superlattice size linearly manifesting itself on two distinct lines in accordance with the respective space groups. We then introduce the use of local environments in the investigation of vibrational properties. Local phonon density of states of the atoms with unique local environments are calculated by molecular dynamics simulations and are used to train a machine learning model. This model is used to predict the phonon density of states of twisted bilayer structures. Performance of the trained model is cross validated and discussed thoroughly via different selection of training and test sets. It is shown that the model proves effective in predicting the vibrational properties of any given twisted bilayer structure. Since the generic method presented reaches far beyond twisted bilayer graphene the possible applications ranging from non-periodic structures to strain induced moir\'e superlattices are also discussed.

Abstract: Exploring the structural, chemical, and physical properties of matter on the nano- and atomic scales has become possible with the recent advances in aberration-corrected electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). However, the current paradigm of STEM-EELS relies on the classical rectangular grid sampling, in which all surface regions are assumed to be of equal a priori interest. This is typically not the case for real-world scenarios, where phenomena of interest are concentrated in a small number of spatial locations. One of foundational problems is the discovery of nanometer- or atomic scale structures having specific signatures in EELS spectra. Here we systematically explore the hyperparameters controlling deep kernel learning (DKL) discovery workflows for STEM-EELS and identify the role of the local structural descriptors and acquisition functions on the experiment progression. In agreement with actual experiment, we observe that for certain parameter combinations the experiment path can be trapped in the local minima. We demonstrate the approaches for monitoring automated experiment in the real and feature space of the system and monitor knowledge acquisition of the DKL model. Based on these, we construct intervention strategies, thus defining human-in the loop automated experiment (hAE). This approach can be further extended to other techniques including 4D STEM and other forms of spectroscopic imaging.

Abstract: Machine learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for improving noisy disordered devices in physics using automated algorithms. Through simulations that include disorder in physical devices, particularly quantum devices, there is potential to learn about disordered landscapes and subsequently tune devices based on those insights. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. This technique takes advantage of experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intra-site and inter-site Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy ($R^2>0.994$) and fewer parameter constraints, marking a significant improvement over previous methods that were focused only on analyzing on-site potentials at low coupling. Furthermore, our approach allows for the tuning of five or more quantum dots at a time, effectively addressing the often-overlooked issue of crosstalk. Not only does our method streamline the tuning process, potentially enabling fully automated adjustments, but it also introduces a "no trust" verification method to rigorously validate the neural network's predictions. Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for generalizing our method to tackle a broad spectrum of physical problems.

Abstract: Quantum nuclear effects and anharmonicity impact a wide range of functional materials and their properties. One of the most powerful techniques to model these effects is the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA). Unfortunately, the SSCHA is extremely computationally expensive, prohibiting its routine use. We propose a protocol that pairs machine learning interatomic potentials, which can be tailored for the system at hand via active learning, with the SSCHA. Our method leverages an upscaling procedure that allows for the treatment of supercells of up to thousands of atoms with practically minimal computational effort. The protocol is applied to PdCuH$_x$ ($x = 0-2$) compounds, chosen because previous experimental studies have reported superconducting critical temperatures, $T_\text{c}$s, as high as 17~K at ambient pressures in an unknown hydrogenated PdCu phase. We identify a $P4/mmm$ PdCuH$_2$ structure, which is shown to be dynamically stable only upon the inclusion of quantum fluctuations, as being a key contributor to the measured superconductivity. For this system, our methodology is able to reduce the computational expense for the SSCHA calculations by $\sim$96\%. The proposed protocol opens the door towards the routine inclusion of quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity in materials discovery.

Abstract: Additively manufactured (AM) aluminum alloys with high strength and thermal stability have broad applications in turbine engines, vacuum pumps, heat exchangers, and many other industrial systems. Employing precipitates with an L1$_2$ structure to block dislocation motions is a widespread strategy to strengthen aluminum. However, to achieve high strength, a high volume fraction of small precipitates is required, and these characteristics are generally mutually exclusive. Here, we show that for certain compositions of Al alloys, L1$_2$ phases initially precipitate as sub-micron metastable ternary phases under the rapid solidification conditions of powder bed AM, yet the subsequent L1$_2$ phases that precipitate during heat treatment of the sample remain at the nanoscale, imparting high strength. For strength to be retained at elevated temperature, these nanoprecipitates must have low coarsening rates. To inversely design the composition of an alloy to have these target microstructural features, we used hybrid calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD)-based integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) and Bayesian optimization techniques. We tested our approach by designing an Al-Er-Zr-Y-Yb-Ni model alloy, and the selected composition was manufactured in powder form as AM feedstock. The strength of specimens manufactured via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) from the designed composition is comparable to that of wrought Al 7075, yet without cracking that occurs upon LPBF of Al 7075. After high-temperature (400$^\circ$C) aging the designed alloy is 50% stronger than the strongest known benchmark printable Al alloy.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are machine learning models that use diffusion processes to learn the probability distribution of high-dimensional data. In recent years, they have become extremely successful in generating multimedia content. However, it is still unknown if such models can be used to generate high-quality datasets of physical models. In this work, we use a Landau-Ginzburg-like diffusion model to infer the distribution of a $2D$ bond-diluted Ising model. Our approach is simple and effective, and we show that the generated samples reproduce correctly the statistical and critical properties of the physical model.

# Unusual energy spectra of matrix product states

## 矩阵乘积态的异常能谱

**Authors:** J. Maxwell Silvester, Giuseppe Carleo, Steven R. White

arXiv:2408.13616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In approximate ground states obtained from imaginary-time evolution, the spectrum of the state -- its decomposition into exact energy eigenstates -- falls off exponentially with the energy. Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate matrix product ground states, such as those obtained with the density matrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states, contributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high energy, with an increase in the bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the extent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra appear to be a general feature of compressed wavefunctions, independent of boundary or dimensionality, and are also observed in neural network wavefunctions. The unusual spectra can have a strong effect on sampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. The energy variance, which can be used to extrapolate observables to eliminate truncation error, is subject to these large fluctuations when sampled. Nevertheless, we devise a sampling-based variance approach which gives excellent and efficient extrapolations.

# Transfer entropy and flow of information in two-skyrmion system

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the flow of information in an interacting two-skyrmion system confined in a box at finite temperature. Using numerical simulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the skyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting the system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Particularly, due to the chiral motion of skyrmion, we find asymmetric flow of information even in equilibrium, which is demonstrated by the violation of the detailed balance condition. We analyze this novel system using information-theoretical quantities including Shannon entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy. By the analyses, the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of flow of information, which has been overlooked in previous studies, is elucidated. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function of time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the two skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the characteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size divided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the information transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information and the time to write the information. Since the unusual asymmetric circulation of information is revealed in this two-skyrmion system, it can be a unique platform for future applications to natural computing using flow of information, including more efficient machine learning algorithm.

Abstract: We introduce a tensor network library designed for classical and quantum physics simulations called Cytnx (pronounced as sci-tens). This library provides almost an identical interface and syntax for both C++ and Python, allowing users to effortlessly switch between two languages. Aiming at a quick learning process for new users of tensor network algorithms, the interfaces resemble the popular Python scientific libraries like NumPy, Scipy, and PyTorch. Not only multiple global Abelian symmetries can be easily defined and implemented, Cytnx also provides a new tool called Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform tensor network contractions in an optimal order automatically. With the integration of cuQuantum, tensor calculations can also be executed efficiently on GPUs. We present benchmark results for tensor operations on both devices, CPU and GPU. We also discuss features and higher-level interfaces to be added in the future.

# Network reconstruction may not mean dynamics prediction

**Authors:** Zhendong Yu, Haiping Huang

arXiv:2409.04240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.

Abstract: Misconception is the difference between a student's idea and his scientific concept. Physics learning needs to be designed by teachers to minimize misconceptions. Different diagnostic tools have been developed and used by researchers to identify student misconceptions. This study addressed to uncover the experiences of eight physics teachers on how they apply diagnostic tools to detect misconceptions experienced by students investigated through phenomenological studies. Physics teachers are invited to volunteer to participate in this research. Physics teachers involved in this research have diversity based on the period of experience teaching physics, geographical area, and the level of students faced. A semi-structured interview (duration of 40 to 60 minutes) through virtually was conducted by the author for all physics teachers involved in this study. Personal Practice Theories (PPTs) by Cornett was chosen as a framework to reveal the experiences and perspectives of physics teachers in making judgments about students' misconceptions of Physics. The findings revealed that four themes were obtained. These themes are (1) personal experiences of Physics teachers, (2) Physics teachers' knowledge, (3) practices in assessing Physics misconceptions, and (4) teachers' reflections on future assessment practice.

arXiv:2501.10449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit Touchdown is a two-player, competitive board game that was developed to introduce students to quantum computing. A quantum computer is a new kind of computer that is based on the laws of quantum physics, and it can solve certain problems faster than normal computers because it follows a different set of rules. Qubit Touchdown's game play mirrors the rules of (American) football, with players taking turns moving the football to score the most touchdowns, and no knowledge of quantum computing is needed to play the game. We evaluated the game with 107 public high school students in Precalculus, Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics, and/or AP Physics 1 courses, assessing whether their interest in and self-efficacy toward quantum computing changed as a result of playing the game and learning about its connections to quantum computing. We also assessed whether the game was easy to learn and enjoyable. We found that students' self-efficacy was improved by 33.4%, and they widely considered the game accessible and fun. Thus, Qubit Touchdown could be an effective resource to introduce students to Quantum Computing and boost their confidence in learning about the field. Free printables of the game are available, and professionally produced copies can be purchased on demand.

Abstract: Solving the two-dimensional shallow water equations is a fundamental problem in flood simulation technology. In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a novel methodology for addressing this problem. Given their advantages in parallel computing, the potential for data assimilation and parameter calibration, and the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, it is crucial to investigate both the capabilities and limitations of PINNs. While current research has demonstrated the significant potential of PINNs, many aspects of this new approach remain to be explored. In this study, we employ PINNs enhanced by dimensional transformation and N-LAAF techniques to validate their effectiveness in solving two-dimensional free surface flow with rainfall on terrain topography. The shallow water equations primarily exist in two forms: the variables form and the conservative form. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that a hybrid variable-conservation form offers superior performance. Additionally, we find that incorporating the energy conservation law, specifically the entropy condition, does not yield substantial improvements and may even lead to training failure. Furthermore, we have developed an open-source module on the PINNacle platform for solving shallow water equations using PINNs, which includes over ten case studies and various equation forms, to promote research and application in this field.

**Authors:** Jiahao Song, Wenbo Cao, Weiwei Zhang

arXiv:2501.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown remarkable prospects in solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PINNs still face the challenge of high computational cost in solving strongly nonlinear PDEs involving fluid dynamics. In this study, inspired by the input design in surrogate modeling, we propose a feature-enhanced neural network. By introducing geometric features including distance and angle or physical features including the solution of the potential flow equation in the inputs of PINNs, FENN can more easily learn the flow, resulting in better performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. We establish the feature networks in advance to avoid the invalid PDE loss in FENN caused by neglecting the partial derivatives of the features with respect to space-time coordinates. Through five numerical experiments involving forward, inverse, and parametric problems, we verify that FENN generally reduces the computational cost of PINNs by approximately four times. In addition, the numerical experiments also demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the number of observed data for inverse problem and successfully solve the parametric problem where PINNs fail.

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is probably the most promising approach for quantum chemistry calculations considering its good balance between calculations precision and speed. In recent years, several neural network-based functionals have been developed for exchange-correlation energy approximation in DFT, DM21 developed by Google Deepmind being the most notable between them. This study focuses on evaluating the efficiency of DM21 functional in predicting molecular geometries, with a focus on the influence of oscillatory behavior in neural network exchange-correlation functionals. We implemented geometry optimization in PySCF for the DM21 functional in geometry optimization problem, compared its performance with traditional functionals, and tested it on various benchmarks. Our findings reveal both the potential and the current challenges of using neural network functionals for geometry optimization in DFT. We propose a solution extending the practical applicability of such functionals and allowing to model new substances with their help.

arXiv:2501.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic spectra and structure of the open d- and f-shell elements are extremely complex, where tens of thousands of transitions between fine structure energy levels can be observed as spectral lines across the infrared and UV per species. Energy level quantum properties and transition wavenumbers of these elements underpins almost all spectroscopic plasma diagnostic investigations, with prominent demands from astronomy and fusion research. Despite their importance, these fundamental data are incomplete for many species. A major limitation for the analyses of emission spectra of the open d- and f-shell elements is the amount of time and human resource required to extract transition wavenumbers and intensities from the spectra. Here, the spectral line detection problem is approached by encoding the spectrum point-wise using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks, where transition wavenumber positions are decoded by a fully connected neural network. The model was trained using simulated atomic spectra and evaluated against experimental Fourier transform spectra of Ni ($Z=28$) covering 1800-70,000 cm$^{-1}$ (5555-143 nm) and Nd ($Z=60$) covering 25,369-32,485 cm$^{-1}$ (394-308 nm), measured under a variety of experimental set-ups. Improvements over conventional methods in line detection were evident, particularly for spectral lines that are noisy, blended, and/or distorted by instrumental spectral resolution-limited ringing. In evaluating model performance, a brief energy level analysis of Ni II using lines newly detected by the neural networks has led to the confident identification of two Ni II levels, $3\text{d}^8$$(^3\text{F}_4)6\text{f} [2]_{3/2}$ at 134,261.8946 $\pm$ 0.0081 cm$^{-1}$ and $3\text{d}^8$$(^3\text{F}_4)6\text{f} [1]_{3/2}$ at 134,249.5264 $\pm$ 0.0054 cm$^{-1}$, previously concluded to be unidentifiable using previously analysed Ni spectra.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a two-dimensional periodic structure integrated with a large number of reflective elements, which can manipulate electromagnetic waves in a digital way, offering great potentials for wireless communication and radar detection applications. However, conventional RIS designs highly rely on extensive full-wave EM simulations that are extremely time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a machine-learning-assisted approach for efficient RIS design. An accurate and fast model to predict the reflection coefficient of RIS element is developed by combining a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) and a dual-port network, which can significantly reduce tedious EM simulations in the network training. A RIS has been practically designed based on the proposed method. To verify the proposed method, the RIS has also been fabricated and measured. The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulation results, which validates the efficacy of the proposed method in RIS design.

Abstract: We present ORCAst, a multi-stage, multi-arm network for Operational high-Resolution Current forecAsts over one week. Producing real-time nowcasts and forecasts of ocean surface currents is a challenging problem due to indirect or incomplete information from satellite remote sensing data. Entirely trained on real satellite data and in situ measurements from drifters, our model learns to forecast global ocean surface currents using various sources of ground truth observations in a multi-stage learning procedure. Our multi-arm encoder-decoder model architecture allows us to first predict sea surface height and geostrophic currents from larger quantities of nadir and SWOT altimetry data, before learning to predict ocean surface currents from much more sparse in situ measurements from drifters. Training our model on specific regions improves performance. Our model achieves stronger nowcast and forecast performance in predicting ocean surface currents than various state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised deep learning has accelerated 2D natural image analysis but remains difficult to translate into 3D MRI, where data are scarce and pre-trained 2D backbones cannot capture volumetric context. We present a sequence-invariant self-supervised framework leveraging quantitative MRI (qMRI). By simulating multiple MRI contrasts from a single 3D qMRI scan and enforcing consistent representations across these contrasts, we learn anatomy-centric rather than sequence-specific features. This yields a robust 3D encoder that performs strongly across varied tasks and protocols. Experiments on healthy brain segmentation (IXI), stroke lesion segmentation (ARC), and MRI denoising show significant gains over baseline SSL approaches, especially in low-data settings (up to +8.3% Dice, +4.2 dB PSNR). Our model also generalises effectively to unseen sites, demonstrating potential for more scalable and clinically reliable volumetric analysis. All code and trained models are publicly available.

Abstract: The unique properties of plastic crystals highlight their potential for use in solid-state refrigeration. However, their practical applications are limited by thermal hysteresis due to low thermal conductivity. In this study, the effect of compressive strain on the thermal transport properties of plastic crystal [(CH3)4N][FeCl4] was investigated using molecular dynamic simulation with a deep neural network potential. It is found that a 9% strain along [001] direction enhances thermal conductivity sixfold. The underlying mechanisms are analyzed through vibrational density of states, spectral energy densities, and mean square displacements. The enhancement in thermal conductivity is primarily due to increased group velocity and reduced phonon scattering, driven by volume compression within the 0-1 THz. These findings offer theoretical insights for the practical application of plastic crystals in thermal management systems.

arXiv:2501.12391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to understand physics of skill learning, i.e., how skills are learned in neural networks during training. We start by observing the Domino effect, i.e., skills are learned sequentially, and notably, some skills kick off learning right after others complete learning, similar to the sequential fall of domino cards. To understand the Domino effect and relevant behaviors of skill learning, we take physicists' approach of abstraction and simplification. We propose three models with varying complexities -- the Geometry model, the Resource model, and the Domino model, trading between reality and simplicity. The Domino effect can be reproduced in the Geometry model, whose resource interpretation inspires the Resource model, which can be further simplified to the Domino model. These models present different levels of abstraction and simplification; each is useful to study some aspects of skill learning. The Geometry model provides interesting insights into neural scaling laws and optimizers; the Resource model sheds light on the learning dynamics of compositional tasks; the Domino model reveals the benefits of modularity. These models are not only conceptually interesting -- e.g., we show how Chinchilla scaling laws can emerge from the Geometry model, but also are useful in practice by inspiring algorithmic development -- e.g., we show how simple algorithmic changes, motivated by these toy models, can speed up the training of deep learning models.

Abstract: Neural networks in fluid mechanics offer an efficient approach for exploring complex flows, including multiphase and free surface flows. The recurrent neural network, particularly the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, proves attractive for learning mappings from transient inputs to dynamic outputs. This study applies LSTM to predict transient and static outputs for fluid flows under surface tension effects. Specifically, we explore two distinct droplet dynamic scenarios: droplets with diverse initial shapes impacting with solid surfaces, as well as the coalescence of two droplets following collision. Using only dimensionless numbers and geometric time series data from numerical simulations, LSTM predicts the energy budget. The marker-and-cell front-tracking methodology combined with a marker-and-cell finite-difference strategy is adopted for simulating the droplet dynamics. Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture fed with time series data derived from geometrical parameters, as for example droplet diameter variation, our study shows the accuracy of our approach in predicting energy budgets, as for instance the kinetic, dissipation, and surface energy trends, across a range of Reynolds and Weber numbers in droplet dynamic problems. Finally, a two-phase sequential neural network using only geometric data, which is readily available in experimental settings, is employed to predict the energies and then use them to estimate static parameters, such as the Reynolds and Weber numbers. While our methodology has been primarily validated with simulation data, its adaptability to experimental datasets is a promising avenue for future exploration. We hope that our strategy can be useful for diverse applications, spanning from inkjet printing to combustion engines, where the prediction of energy budgets or dissipation energies is crucial.

Abstract: Most modern imaging systems process the data they capture computationally, either to make the measurement more interpretable for human viewing or to analyze it without a human in the loop. As a result, what matters is not how measurements appear visually, but how much information they contain. Information theory provides mathematical tools to quantify this; however, it has found limited use in imaging system design due to the challenge of developing methods that can handle the complexity of real-world measurements yet remain practical enough for widespread use. We introduce a data-driven approach for estimating the information content of imaging system measurements in order to evaluate system performance and optimize designs. Our framework requires only a dataset of experimental measurements and a means for noise characterization, enabling its use in real systems without ground truth data. We validate that these information estimates reliably predict system performance across diverse imaging modalities, including color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and label-free microscopy. We further introduce an optimization technique called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) for designing imaging systems that maximize information capture. This work unlocks information theory as a powerful, practical tool for analyzing and designing imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

**Authors:** Daniel Freedman, Eyal Rozenberg, Alex Bronstein

Abstract: A central problem in quantum mechanics involves solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation for a molecule or material. The Variational Monte Carlo approach to this problem approximates a particular variational objective via sampling, and then optimizes this approximated objective over a chosen parameterized family of wavefunctions, known as the ansatz. Recently neural networks have been used as the ansatz, with accompanying success. However, sampling from such wavefunctions has required the use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, which is inherently inefficient. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem via an ansatz which is cheap to sample from, yet satisfies the requisite quantum mechanical properties. We prove that a normalizing flow using the following two essential ingredients satisfies our requirements: (a) a base distribution which is constructed from Determinantal Point Processes; (b) flow layers which are equivariant to a particular subgroup of the permutation group. We then show how to construct both continuous and discrete normalizing flows which satisfy the requisite equivariance. We further demonstrate the manner in which the non-smooth nature ("cusps") of the wavefunction may be captured, and how the framework may be generalized to provide induction across multiple molecules. The resulting theoretical framework entails an efficient approach to solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation.

Abstract: The Gillespie algorithm is commonly used to simulate and analyze complex chemical reaction networks. Here, we leverage recent breakthroughs in deep learning to develop a fully differentiable variant of the Gillespie algorithm. The differentiable Gillespie algorithm (DGA) approximates discontinuous operations in the exact Gillespie algorithm using smooth functions, allowing for the calculation of gradients using backpropagation. The DGA can be used to quickly and accurately learn kinetic parameters using gradient descent and design biochemical networks with desired properties. As an illustration, we apply the DGA to study stochastic models of gene promoters. We show that the DGA can be used to: (i) successfully learn kinetic parameters from experimental measurements of mRNA expression levels from two distinct $\textit{E. coli}$ promoters and (ii) design nonequilibrium promoter architectures with desired input-output relationships. These examples illustrate the utility of the DGA for analyzing stochastic chemical kinetics, including a wide variety of problems of interest to synthetic and systems biology.

# Distilling Machine Learning's Added Value: Pareto Fronts in Atmospheric Applications

Abstract: The added value of machine learning for weather and climate applications is measurable through performance metrics, but explaining it remains challenging, particularly for large deep learning models. Inspired by climate model hierarchies, we propose that a full hierarchy of Pareto-optimal models, defined within an appropriately determined error-complexity plane, can guide model development and help understand the models' added value. We demonstrate the use of Pareto fronts in atmospheric physics through three sample applications, with hierarchies ranging from semi-empirical models with minimal parameters to deep learning algorithms. First, in cloud cover parameterization, we find that neural networks identify nonlinear relationships between cloud cover and its thermodynamic environment, and assimilate previously neglected features such as vertical gradients in relative humidity that improve the representation of low cloud cover. This added value is condensed into a ten-parameter equation that rivals deep learning models. Second, we establish a machine learning model hierarchy for emulating shortwave radiative transfer, distilling the importance of bidirectional vertical connectivity for accurately representing absorption and scattering, especially for multiple cloud layers. Third, we emphasize the importance of convective organization information when modeling the relationship between tropical precipitation and its surrounding environment. We discuss the added value of temporal memory when high-resolution spatial information is unavailable, with implications for precipitation parameterization. Therefore, by comparing data-driven models directly with existing schemes using Pareto optimality, we promote process understanding by hierarchically unveiling system complexity, with the hope of improving the trustworthiness of machine learning models in atmospheric applications.

# Learning rheological parameters of non-Newtonian fluids from velocimetry data

arXiv:2408.02604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct the flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters. By incorporating a Carreau shear-thinning viscosity model into the N-S problem, we devise an algorithm that learns the most likely Carreau parameters of a shear-thinning fluid, and estimates their uncertainties, from velocimetry data alone. We then conduct a flow-MRI experiment to obtain velocimetry data of an axisymmetric laminar jet through an idealised medical device (FDA nozzle) for a blood analogue fluid. We show that the algorithm can successfully reconstruct the flow field by learning the most likely Carreau parameters, and that the learned parameters are in very good agreement with rheometry measurements. The algorithm accepts any algebraic effective viscosity model, as long as the model is differentiable, and it can be extended to more complicated non-Newtonian fluids (e.g. Oldroyd-B fluid) if a viscoelastic model is incorporated into the N-S problem.

Abstract: This study utilises linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) and develops a new machine-learning potential for carbon and nitrogen (GAP-CN), based on the carbon potential (GAP20), to investigate the interaction between carbon self-interstitials and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, focusing on their excited states and diffusion behaviour. From the simulated excited states, 'Bright', 'Spike', and 'Dark' defect configurations are classified based on their absorption spectrum features. Furthermore, machine learning molecular dynamics simulation provides insight into the possible diffusion mechanism of Ci and NV, showing that Ci can diffuse away or recombine with NV. The study yields new insight into the formation of NV defects in diamond for quantum technology applications.

Abstract: Elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) is a chaotic state that emerges in the flows of dilute polymer solutions. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of EIT is highly computationally expensive due to the need to resolve the multi-scale nature of the system. While DNS of 2D EIT typically requires $O(10^6)$ degrees of freedom, we demonstrate here that a data-driven modeling framework allows for the construction of an accurate model with 50 degrees of freedom. We achieve a low-dimensional representation of the full state by first applying a viscoelastic variant of proper orthogonal decomposition to DNS results, and then using an autoencoder. The dynamics of this low-dimensional representation are learned using the neural ODE method, which approximates the vector field for the reduced dynamics as a neural network. The resulting low-dimensional data-driven model effectively captures short-time dynamics over the span of one correlation time, as well as long-time dynamics, particularly the self-similar, nested traveling wave structure of 2D EIT in the parameter range considered.

Abstract: Point spread function (PSF) engineering is vital for precisely controlling the focus of light in computational imaging, with applications in neural imaging, fluorescence microscopy, and biophotonics. The PSF is derived from the magnitude of the Fourier transform of a phase function, making the construction of the phase function given the PSF (PSF engineering) an ill-posed inverse problem. Traditional PSF engineering methods rely on physical basis functions, limiting their ability to generalize across the range of PSFs required for imaging tasks. We introduce a novel approach leveraging implicit neural representations that overcome the limitations of pixel-wise optimization methods. Our approach achieves a median MSSIM of 0.8162 and a mean MSSIM of 0.5634, compared to a median MSSIM of 0.0 and a mean MSSIM of 0.1841 with pixel-wise optimization when learning randomly generated phase functions. Our approach also achieves a median PSNR of 10.38 dB and a mean PSNR of 8.672 dB, compared to a median PSNR of 6.653 dB and a mean PSNR of 6.660 dB with pixel-wise optimization for this task.

Abstract: Natural light-harvesting antenna complexes efficiently capture solar energy using chlorophyll, i.e., magnesium porphyrin pigments, embedded in a protein matrix. Inspired by this natural configuration, artificial clay-porphyrin antenna structures have been experimentally synthesized and have demonstrated remarkable excitation energy transfer properties. The study presents the computational design and simulation of a synthetic light-harvesting system that emulates natural mechanisms by arranging cationic free-base porphyrin molecules on an anionic clay surface. We investigated the transfer of excitation energy among the porphyrin dyes using a multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach based on the semi-empirical density functional-based tight-binding (DFTB) theory for the ground state dynamics. To improve the accuracy of our results, we incorporated an innovative multifidelity machine learning (MFML) approach, which allows the prediction of excitation energies at the numerically demanding time-dependent density functional theory level with the Def2-SVP basis set. This approach was applied to an extensive dataset of 640K geometries for the 90-atom porphyrin structures, facilitating a thorough analysis of the excitation energy diffusion among the porphyrin molecules adsorbed to the clay surface. The insights gained from this study, inspired by natural light-harvesting complexes, demonstrate the potential of porphyrin-clay systems as effective energy transfer systems.

Abstract: Epilepsy is known to drastically alter brain dynamics during seizures (ictal periods), but its effects on background (non-ictal) brain dynamics remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we analyzed an in-house dataset of brain activity recordings from epileptic zebrafish, focusing on two controlled genetic conditions across two fishlines. After using machine learning to segment and label recordings, we applied time-delay embedding and Persistent Homology -- a noise-robust method from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) -- to uncover topological patterns in brain activity. We find that ictal and non-ictal periods can be distinguished based on the topology of their dynamics, independent of genetic condition or fishline, which validates our approach. Remarkably, within a single wild-type fishline, we identified topological differences in non-ictal periods between seizure-prone and seizure-free individuals. These findings suggest that epilepsy leaves detectable topological signatures in brain dynamics even outside of ictal periods. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of TDA as a quantitative framework to screen for topological markers of epileptic susceptibility, with potential applications across species.

Abstract: The first experimental evidence of quantum Drude oscillator behavior in liquids is determined using probabilistic machine learning-augmented iterative Boltzmann inversion applied to noble gas radial distribution functions. Furthermore, classical force fields for noble gases are shown to be reduced to a single parameter through simple empirical relations linked to atomic dipole polarizability. These findings highlight how neutron scattering data can inspire innovative force field design and offer insight into interatomic forces to advance molecular simulations.

Abstract: Understanding microstructure-property relationships (MPRs) is essential for optimising the performance of multiphase composites. Image-based poro/micro-mechanical modelling provides a non-invasive approach to exploring MPRs, but the randomness of multiphase composites often necessitates extensive 3D microstructure datasets for statistical reliability. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning framework to reconstruct numerous virtual 3D microstructures from limited 2D exemplars, circumventing the high costs of volumetric microscopy. Using feedforward neural networks, termed the statistics-encoded neural network (SENN), the framework encodes 2D morphological statistics and infers 3D morphological statistics via a 2D-to-3D integration scheme. Statistically equivalent 3D microstructures are synthesised using Gibbs sampling. Hierarchical characterisation enables seamless capture of features across multiple scales. Validation on three composites demonstrates strong statistical equivalence between reconstructed and reference microstructures, confirmed by morphological descriptors and simulated macroscopic properties (e.g., stiffness, permeability). The SENN-based framework is a high-fidelity tool for efficiently and accurately reconstructing multiphase microstructures.

Abstract: Chebyshev polynomials have shown significant promise as an efficient tool for both classical and quantum neural networks to solve linear and nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we adapt and generalize this framework in a quantum machine learning setting for a variety of problems, including the 2D Poisson's equation, second-order linear differential equation, system of differential equations, nonlinear Duffing and Riccati equation. In particular, we propose in the quantum setting a modified Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (SAPINN) approach, where self-adaptive weights are applied to problems with multi-objective loss functions. We further explore capturing correlations in our loss function using a quantum-correlated measurement, resulting in improved accuracy for initial value problems. We analyse also the use of entangling layers and their impact on the solution accuracy for second-order differential equations. The results indicate a promising approach to the near-term evaluation of differential equations on quantum devices.

Abstract: The evidence indicates that intracranial EEG connectivity, as estimated from daily resting state recordings from epileptic patients, may be capable of identifying preictal states. In this study, we employed hyperbolic embedding of brain networks to capture non-trivial patterns that discriminate between connectivity networks from days with (preictal) and without (interictal) seizure. A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that representations of brain connectivity in a latent geometry space can reveal a daily and reliable signature of the upcoming seizure(s), thus providing a promising biomarker for seizure forecasting.

# Network reconstruction may not mean dynamics prediction

**Authors:** Zhendong Yu, Haiping Huang

arXiv:2409.04240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.

**Authors:** Filipp, Gusev

Proteochemometric models (PCM) are used in computational drug discovery to leverage both protein and ligand representations for bioactivity prediction. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have come to dominate PCMs, often serving as scoring functions, rigorous evaluation standards have not always been consistently applied. In this study, using kinase-ligand bioactivity prediction as a model system, we highlight the critical roles of dataset curation, permutation testing, class imbalances, data splitting strategies, and embedding quality in determining model performance. Our findings indicate that data splitting and class imbalances are the most critical factors affecting PCM performance, emphasizing the challenges in generalizing ability of ML/DL-PCMs. We evaluated various protein-ligand descriptors and embeddings, including those augmented with multiple sequence alignment (MSA) information. However, permutation testing consistently demonstrated that protein embeddings contributed minimally to PCM efficacy. This study advocates for the adoption of stringent evaluation standards to enhance the generalizability of models to out-of-distribution data and improve benchmarking practices.

**Authors:** Donald, Truhlar

We improved the potential energy surfaces for fourteen coupled 3A′ states of O3 by using parametrically managed diabatization by deep neural network (PM-DDNN) with three improvements: (1) We use a new functional form for the parametrically managed activation function, which ensures the continuity of the coordinates used in the parametric management. (2) We used higher weighting for low-lying states to achieve smoother potential energy surfaces. (3) The asymptotic behavior of the coupled potential energy surfaces was further refined by utilizing a better low-dimensional potential. As a result of these improvements, we obtained significantly smoother potentials that are better suited for dynamics calculations. For the new version of 14 coupled 3A′ surfaces, the entire set of 532,560 adiabatic energies are fit with a mean unsigned error (MUE) of 45 meV, which is only 0.7% of the mean energy in the data set, which is 6.24 eV.

Vinyl boronates are highly valuable intermediates in chemical synthesis, extensively used in C‒C bond-forming reactions such as catalytic cross-coupling. Transition metal-catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes has emerged as a key method for synthesizing these building blocks. While classical approaches rely on noble metals like rhodium and iridium, copper-catalyzed hydroboration offers a sustainable and cost-effective alternative. This strategy utilizes bench-stable reagents under mild conditions, delivering highly stereoselective trans-vinylboronates. However, predicting regioselectivity re-mains a challenge due to the complex interplay of ligand structures, alkyne substitution patterns, and reaction conditions. To address this, we employed a combination of experimental data, high-throughput computational calculations, and ma-chine learning (ML) to develop predictive models for regioselectivity. Ligand and catalyst descriptors were derived from DFT calculations and literature databases, forming a robust dataset used to train ML algorithms. Further optimization proved effective in guiding experimental efforts by identifying promising ligands and improving hydroboration yields. This workflow integrates experimental and computational tools to achieve a stereocontrolled synthesis of substituted alkenyl boronates from alkynes. As a case study, we demonstrate the successful application of ML-guided optimization, reducing copper catalyst loading while improving yields and regioselectivity.

High-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations have become a vital element of computational materials science, enabling materials screening, property database generation, and training of “universal” machine learning models. While several software frameworks have emerged to support these computational efforts, new developments such as machine learned force fields have increased demands for more flexible and programmable workflow solutions. This manuscript introduces atomate2, a comprehensive evolution of our original atomate framework, designed to address existing limitations in computational materials research infrastructure. Key features include the support for multiple electronic structure packages and interoperability between them, along with generalizable workflows that can be written in an abstract form irrespective of the DFT package or machine learning force field used within them. Our hope is that atomate2’s improved usability and extensibility can reduce technical barriers for high-throughput research workflows and facilitate the rapid adoption of emerging methods in computational material science.

**Authors:** Arkaprava, Roy

Learning aqueous solubility remains a key challenge in drug development for improving oral bioavailability. Traditional data-driven solubility estimations using standard supervised models, however, can often suppress the information embedded in a molecule’s chemical properties and the intricate connectivity of its atoms. In addition to the predictive analyses for solubility, it is also crucial to investigate the underlying scientific factors that influence the aqueous solubility of potential drug candidates. This paper attempts to learn such properties and further proposes a novel nonparametric model with an additive-type characterization that provides insights into the differential contribution of the chemical and graphical descriptors, that are important in learning a molecule’s solubility in an aqueous solvent. The dataset used in this work includes over 9000 experimental structural, chemical, and electronic properties. Using graph-theoretic attributes derived from molecular graphs, we characterize the structural traits of the molecules. Our analysis reveals several intriguing properties of solubility and its physicochemical relationship with both structural and chemical features of the molecules, specifically based on their weights and shapes.

# Data reconstruction from machine learning models via inverse estimation and Bayesian inference

## 通过逆估计和贝叶斯推理从机器学习模型中重建数据

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5220310/latest

This study explores the task of data reconstruction from machine learning models via inverse estimation and Bayesian inference, with the goal of recovering the original dataset solely based on the trained model. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that investigates the factors affecting the data reconstruction quality. Specifically, we derive expressions that quantify how variations in key variables influence the divergence between true and estimated posteriors by examining the concurrent behavior of their partial derivatives with respect to independent variables. This derivative-based approach establishes theoretical correlations between the variables, demonstrating that the fidelity of the recovered data is governed by two primary factors: (1) the accuracy of the assumed prior, and (2) the accuracy of the machine learning model. Empirical results across multiple benchmark datasets and machine learning algorithms corroborate these theoretical predictions, reinforcing the validity and robustness of our theoretical framework. Practically, our data reconstruction method enables the creation of synthetic models that closely replicate the performance of the original models. This work contributes to advancing the theoretical understanding and practical techniques for data reconstruction and model introspection within the context of machine learning.

# Embedded-Filter ACO using Clustering Based Mutual Information for Feature Selection

## 使用基于聚类的互信息进行特征选择的嵌入式滤波器ACO

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5871619/latest

The performance of any machine learning algorithm depends on the purity of the dataset used. A dataset contains both necessary and unnecessary or redundant features. Feature selection is the process of selecting essential features and removing unnecessary and redundant features. Eliminating unnecessary features also minimizes the computational resources needed for processing and storing the datasets. Feature selection methods are broadly classified as filter-based methods and wrapper-based methods. On the other hand, ant colony optimization (ACO) is one widely used bio-inspired meta-heuristic technique used for the selection of optimal solutions. The widely used heuristic measure in ACO for feature selection techniques is mutual information. However, the traditional mutual information can be used effectively with only categorical features. In this paper, we propose an embedded-filter ACO feature selection technique (EFACO) that is embedded with clustering-based mutual information as a heuristic measure for datasets with continuous features and discrete labels. To show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, EFACO was used on various datasets, and the selected feature subsets were tested with multiple machine learning algorithms. The results clearly show that the EFACO selects the minimal number of features without diminishing the efficiency of machine learning algorithms in the majority of cases.

## 医疗保健领域对数字和人工智能技能的需求: 中国工作清单的NLP分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5867918/latest

Background: The rapid growth of the healthcare industry in China has led to a significant talent gap, particularly in the areas of digital skills and management expertise. This study aims to bridge this gap by analyzing healthcare job listings using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify specific skills and management capabilities in high demand.
Methods: We collected 42,032 healthcare job listings from eight major recruitment websites in China, focusing on positions requiring a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher and posted within the last year. To extract relevant information from job descriptions, including required skills, qualifications, and roles, we employed an AI agent based on the latest ChatGPT model. The model was fine-tuned using advanced Prompt-Tuning techniques to adapt it to the specific context of healthcare job listings. This involved designing task-specific prompts, preprocessing the data to remove duplicates and normalize text, and training the model using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Results: The analysis revealed a strong demand for technical skills such as data analysis (mentioned in 53.65% of listings), AI and machine learning (18.05%), and technology integration (28.3%). Compliance and data privacy skills were also highly demanded, reflecting the healthcare sector&rsquo;s commitment to regulatory adherence and data security. Additionally, management and leadership skills were identified as critical, with project management mentioned in 46.32% of listings. Regional disparities were observed, with higher demand for digital skills in urban areas such as Beijing and Shanghai compared to rural regions. Emerging roles such as &ldquo;digital health strategist&rdquo; and &ldquo;chief data officer&rdquo; were also identified, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.
Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the current and future talent demands in the healthcare industry. By leveraging NLP techniques to analyze job listings, we can identify specific skill gaps and develop targeted strategies for talent development and recruitment. This research contributes to the understanding of the healthcare talent gap and offers practical recommendations for policymakers, healthcare providers, and educational institutions to ensure a sustainable and skilled workforce in the healthcare sector. Future research should explore additional data sources and qualitative methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding of healthcare talent needs globally.

# The Impact of Public Health and Social Determinants on Maternal Factors for Academic Nurturance and the Cognitive Development of Preschool Children: A Cross-sectional Research Study

## 公共卫生和社会决定因素对学龄前儿童学业养成和认知发展的母亲因素的影响: 一项横断面研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5760180/latest

Background: The importance of the impact of public health and social determinants on maternal factors for academic nurturing and the cognitive development of preschool children for family-based and institutional nutrition interventions reveals a concerning prevalence of suboptimal behaviours across all countries. Early intervention strategies to cultivate healthy habits, particularly in preschool and childcare settings, highlight the importance of addressing socioeconomic barriers that prevent families from adopting health-promoting behaviours.
Methods: Creating engaging learning experiences, providing emotional warmth, and fostering social interactions are essential for nurturing children's cognitive development. This study explored the factors influencing cognitive development in 389 preschool children (aged 3-5) in Rupandehi District, Nepal. A cross-sectional survey design employing multistage random sampling was used to collect socioeconomic and demographic data, alongside caregivers' academic nurturance practices, through validated instruments and interviews. Data analysis was conducted via IBM SPSS version 26, with significance set at p&amp;lt;0.05.
Results: Forty-eight percent of thefamilies were economically disadvantaged, and only 15.5% of the caregivers exhibited high levels of academic nurturance. While academic nurturance itself did not have a direct effect on cognitive development, the unadjusted analysis revealedpositive associations between cognitive development and wealth status, maternal education, family structure, caste/ethnicity and the age of children. Multivariate analysis confirmed that family type, caste/ethnicity and the age of the childwere key factors in predicting cognitive development. The economic status predictor of cognitive development (&beta; = -0.254, p = 0.000), negative association with lower economic status, and poorer cognitive development academic nurturance were added as predictors (&beta; = -0.003, p = 0.954), accounting for 8.0% of the variance in cognitive development (R&sup2; = 8.0%), with an F-statistic of 4.667 (p = 0.000).
Conclusion: Addressing these socioeconomic determinants could lead to significant improvements in children's cognitive outcomes. Finally, the study emphasizes the complex link between maternal characteristics, social determinants, and treatments in determining preschool children's caring and cognitive development. The findings highlight the need for targeted public health interventions that address these interconnected elements, emphasizing the importance of fostering social determinants and public health principles in increasing maternal involvement, and reducing socioeconomic barriers to optimal child development.

# LLM-based Intermediate Interpretations for Predicting Nurse Stress and Its Causes from Step Count Data

## 基于LLM的中间解释，用于从步数数据预测护士压力及其原因

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5799716/latest

Purpose: This study aims to propose and evaluate a hybrid approach that combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based interpretation with machine learning (ML)-based prediction to estimate stress levels and their causes from step count data. The research addresses the gap in existing datasets that lack information on the underlying causes of stress.&amp;nbsp;
Methods: Step count data, stress assessments (QIDS score), and stress causes were collected from 30 nurses using six questionnaires rated on a 4-point Likert scale over eight days within one month. Two tasks were designed for evaluation: (1) assessing the contribution of intermediate interpretations to the accuracy of stress presence estimation and (2) validating the use of intermediate interpretations for identifying stress causes. BERT models with and without intermediate stress interpretations were compared, alongside a prompt-based approach.&amp;nbsp;
Results: In the first task, BERT with intermediate interpretations achieved the highest accuracy of 0.74, outperforming BERT using raw step count data (0.63) and distance data (0.59). In the second task, the same model achieved a ranking accuracy of 0.60, compared to 0.56 for raw step count data. Significant correlations were identified between stress levels and work-related factors such as ''workplace relationships,'' ''busy work,'' ''heavy responsibilities,'' and ''lack of time off.''&amp;nbsp;
Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that incorporating LLM-based intermediate interpretations enhances the accuracy of stress prediction and facilitates the identification of key stress causes. This hybrid approach offers a promising framework for analyzing mental health using sensor data.

Research findings indicate that a significant proportion of invoices issued to small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as business-to- business entities, in the United States and United Kingdom are settled beyond their due dates. The primary objective of this study is to investigate customer payment behavior in relation to invoice payments and introduce an analytical framework for studying and projecting payment patterns. Our reasoning can subsequently be integrated into a decision support framework, enabling decision makers to formulate forecasts relating to future disbursements and to initiate appropriate measures aimed at recovering any outstanding liabilities, or to modify their financial strategies in accordance with projected cashflow figures. Our examination involves the utilization of a comprehensive dataset comprising over 1.6 million customers, encompassing their invoice details, payment history, and interactions, such as email communication, SMS, and phone calls, initiated by the company issuing the invoices in order to prompt payment. We employ both supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies to anticipate the likelihood of a customer settling their invoice or outstanding balance by the upcoming due date, drawing upon the interactions initiated by the company and the corresponding customer responses. We introduce an innovative behavioral scoring framework to be utilized as a predictive model input. The outcomes of logistic regression examined in the study demonstrate a maximum accuracy of 97%, irrespective of whether preclustering of customers was conducted, compared to the other two machine learning methodologies evaluated. This model exhibits considerable potential to assist decision-makers in formulating strategies that enhance the financial robustness of the organization through effective cash flow management and reduction of extraneous corporate credit lines.

Background The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare has led to promising advancements in clinical decision-making and diagnostic accuracy. In dentistry, automated methods to evaluate oral hygiene measures, such as dental plaque detection, could improve patient care and streamline remote assessments.Objective This study aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning (DL)-based system that automatically detects and quantifies dental plaque, using a standardized plaque index, from intraoral images.Methods Seventy participants were assessed using the Quigley-Hein plaque index, a clinical measure of plaque accumulation, following the application of a plaque-disclosing agent. Images were captured before and after dye application. Each tooth was labeled using the LabelMe software, indicating both tooth number and plaque presence for training and validation of the DL model. The performance of the DL-based system was statistically compared to the assessments of a highly experienced dentist (10 years) and a dental hygienist (1 year).Results After data augmentation, the DL model achieved a micro-average accuracy of 73.67% and a macro-average accuracy of 65.15%, with a precision of 76.34%, recall of 65.15%, and an F1 score of 66.15%. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the DL model&amp;rsquo;s performance and that of the experienced dentist (P&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;0.05), supporting its clinical reliability.Conclusion The DL-based system successfully automated the evaluation of dental plaque from images, performing comparably to an experienced clinician. These findings underscore the potential for AI-driven plaque assessment tools to enhance digital dentistry, support tele-dentistry services, and improve oral healthcare delivery.

Skin cancer is one of the dangerous cancers that threatens human life and can be seen in lesions on the patient&rsquo;s skin. If this disease is not treated in time, it can threaten the patient&rsquo;s life. However, with early detection of this disease, more effective treatment measures can be used and its progression can be prevented. Many machine learning and deep learning methods have been developed for early detection of skin cancer. But one of the advantages that can be provided by deep learning is its ability to learn from large data sets, which makes it more favorable for deep learning methods. The present paper proposes a method based on the combination of Swin transformer and Wavelet for classifying skin cancer images. In addition, feature optimization is performed using improved gray wolf optimizer(IGWO), Fox optimizer (FOX) and modified gorilla troops optimizer (MGTO) to identify optimal feature values. ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2017 datasets are used to evaluate the developed model. From the obtained results, it is shown that the Swin Transformer-based Wavelet +MGTO model provides the best result on the ISIC-2016 data set, achieving an accuracy of 0.9792. Furthermore, the Swin Transformer-based Wavelet +IGWO model provides the highest performance on the ISIC-2017 dataset, with an accuracy of 0.9792 and an F-measure score of 0.9780 on the ISIC-2017 data set.

Due to their universal applicability, machine learning models (ML) have been a hot topic during the last two decades. Despite their effectiveness, some ML models exhibit inefficiency, particularly in big data classification. Moreover, some ML models have been seen ineffective on some small datasets. In this regard, due to the growing accessibility of online data, the automatic data classification technique has attracted a lot of study interest. As a result, numerous unique learning strategies have been developed in the text categorization field. The Centroid-Based Classifier (CBC) is one of these most extensively used technique among them. While focusing on enhancing NC classifier, this paper, therefore, aims to briefly investigate the impact of some ML models on small and medium-sized dataset&rsquo;s classification. Among these models: N-Centroid technique (NC) as a simply-designed classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multinomial Bayesian (MNB). Most importantly, this paper introduces an enhanced variation of NC via its integration with two similarity measures, namely, Set Theory Based Similarity Measure (STB-SM) and Improved Cosine Similarity Measure (ISC). The performance of integrated NC classifiers has been seen as promising in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

Multimodal music information retrieval (MIR) has gained much significance and there exists a plethora of datasets in different formats as well as machine learning and deep learning models built on these datasets for MIR tasks. However, these datasets are mostly found in high-resourced languages making the models biased to these cultures and languages. To bridge this gap, we curate a novel multimodal music information retrieval dataset that brings to bear the Akan culture and language. This Akan MIR music video dataset comprises of the different modalities, textual, visual and audio used for MIR applications such as music sentiment analysis, genre classification, emotion recognition and recommender systems.
The curation of this datasets includes selecting music videos in different genres that reflect the diverse culture and language of the Akans, downloading them to extract the different modalities for MIR tasks. Python scripts were written to extract these relevant modalities. Indigenous Akan speakers well versed in the content and context of these songs and the culture and traditions labeled and translated the videos to make it easier for machine learning tasks. The source code and datasets have been made open access in a GitHub repository https://github.com/CAIRGH/Multimodal-Twi-Music.
