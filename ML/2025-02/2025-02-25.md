# Enhancing Monte Carlo Tree Search for Retrosynthesis

## 增强蒙特卡罗树搜索的逆向合成

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dlrq7?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Kristian, Spoerer

Computer-Assisted Synthesis Programs are increasingly employed by organic chemists. Often, these tools combine neural networks for policy prediction with heuristic search algorithms. We propose two novel enhancements, which we call eUCT and dUCT, to the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. The enhancements were deployed in AiZynthFinder and have been integrated into the open-source electronic lab notebook, AI4Green, available at https://ai4green.app. A memory-efficient stock file was used to reduce the computational carbon footprint. Both enhancements significantly reduced, by up to 50%, the computational clock-time to solve 1,500 heavy (500 to 800 Da) molecules. The dUCT enhancement increased the number of routes found per molecule for the 1,500 heavy molecules and a 50,000-molecule set from ChEMBL. eUCT and dUCT-v2 solved between 600 and 900 more molecules than the unenhanced MCTS algorithm across the 50,000 molecules. When limited to a 150 second time constraint, dUCT-v1 solved ~5 million more routes to the 50,000 targets than the unenhanced algorithm.

**Authors:** Alberto, Marbán-González

Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium classified among the ESKAPE pathogens, which are anticipated to pose a significant global health emergency in the coming decades. The FabI enzyme, present in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, is a key enzyme involved in fatty acid synthesis II (FAS-II). In this study, we utilized transformation rules to expand the chemical space from the most potent S. aureus FabI inhibitors. Three newly generated focused libraries, named INDDS, DIADS, and PYRDS, encompassed 172,026 compounds. These compounds were ranked based on structural similarity and predicted pIC50 values obtained from machine learning models. This approach allowed to prioritize compounds in each focused library targeting S. aureus FabI. We analyzed the pharmacological properties and chemical space diversity of the S. aureus FabI inhibitors to gather relevant insights and support the prioritization of compounds for further study. The three newly generated libraries are freely available at https://github.com/DIFACQUIM/S.aureus_inhibitors

# A systematic and general machine learning approach to build a consistent data set from different experiments: application to the thermal conductivity of methane

## 一种系统且通用的机器学习方法，用于从不同的实验中构建一致的数据集: 应用于甲烷的热导率

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-g6bsl-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Luiz Octavio, Pereira

Experimental data from different sources present challenges due to variability and noise from various experimental conditions, apparatuses, and environmental factors. In this work, we propose a general method to address these challenges to build a consistent data set. As a case study, we analyze experimental data sets of methane’s thermal conductivity across the liquid, vapor, and supercritical phases. The method is based on machine learning (ML) techniques, which consistently integrate data from various experimental sources. It feeds raw data compiled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database to different ML algorithms to achieve this purpose. Our findings indicate that ML models yield predictions closer to the NIST’s processed data than to the original raw experimental data used to train the models. This demonstrates the models’ generalization from heterogeneous, noisy, and untreated data sets. While our approach does not eliminate preprocessing, it suggests that ML can autonomously handle noisy data, providing a faster and cost-effective alternative to traditional pre- and post-processing methods. By guiding the refinement of labor-intensive methods, ML proves adaptable for real-time data, enabling immediate adjustments and revolutionizing industrial and scientific optimizations. Therefore, the proposed ML approach is general and efficient in handling complex and heterogeneous data to deliver reliable predictions without extensive preprocessing.

# Integrating Machine Learning-Based Pose Sampling with Established Scoring Functions for Virtual Screening

## 基于机器学习的姿态采样与已建立的评分函数相结合，用于虚拟筛选

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-96kzg-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Hosein, Fooladi

Physics-based docking methods have long been the cornerstone of structure-based virtual screening (VS). However, the emergence of machine learning (ML)-based docking approaches has opened up new possibilities for enhancing VS technologies. In this study, we explore the integration of DiffDock-L, a leading ML-based pose sampling method, into VS workflows by combining it with the well-established Vina and Gnina scoring functions. We assess this integrated approach in terms of its VS effectiveness, pose sampling quality, and complementarity to traditional physics-based docking methods, such as AutoDock Vina. Our findings from the DUDEZ benchmark dataset show that DiffDock-L performs competitively in both VS performance and pose sampling in cross-docking settings. In most cases, it generates physically plausible and biologically relevant poses, establishing itself as a viable alternative to physics-based docking algorithms. Additionally, we found that the choice of scoring function significantly influences VS success.

# Semantic Drawn Robot Language : a method to extract robotic programs from physically drawn symbols

## 语义绘制的机器人语言: 一种从物理绘制的符号中提取机器人程序的方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5950997/latest

This paper builds on top of existing research that have developed methods and software to instruct industrial robot arms through physical drawings made on work-pieces. Previous research has presented two principal findings: 1) a calibration and implementation method for a visual system that isolates drawings, creates a digital twin, and allows operators to augment it with fabrication information through a software. And 2) a symbol training pipeline, where symbols can be digitally drawn, labelled, stored in a database, and used to train a Machine Learning pipeline to classify physical drawings. In building on top of these findings, this research presents a method to convert physically drawn symbols by using computer vision algorithms and kMeans clustering to convert them into robotic fabrication instructions. The method consists of two computational layers, where images are first segmented and classified, before geometric information is extracted and converted into robotic fabrication sequences. The developed method is demonstrated through the manufacturing of a wall section using a full-scale robotic setup, consisting of an ABB IRB 6620, equipped with a webcam and 5.6 KW spindle with a 20 mm routing bit.

# LocoTrackAI: advanced convolutional neural network-based tool for monitoring locomotor activity in dengue-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes

## LocoTrackAI: 先进的基于卷积神经网络的工具，用于监测登革热感染的埃及伊蚊的运动活动

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6067469/latest

Monitoring the locomotor activity of mosquitoes is vital for understanding their behavioral patterns and role in disease transmission. Studies investigating the locomotor activity of dengue-infected mosquitoes have faced several limitations, including confining mosquitoes within small tubes that restrict natural movement, discontinuous recordings that fail to provide detailed activity patterns, and the lack of open-source tools to effectively monitor mosquito locomotor activity. Here, we present LocoTrackAI, a robust artificial intelligence-based tool that leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-object tracking algorithm to comprehensively analyze the locomotor activity of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from videos recorded using standard laboratory cages. LocoTrackAI automatically processes video datasets, tracks individual mosquito identities, and provides detailed locomotion results for both individual mosquitoes and group activity, including spatial distributions, movement patterns, heat maps, and activity ratios. The tool features a Skip Frame function to improve computational efficiency, adjustable movement thresholds for customized sensitivity, and a user-friendly interface that supports unsupervised batch processing, ensuring accuracy and flexibility for diverse research applications. The LocoTrackAI achieved 99.91% accuracy with a low centroid detection error of 0.22 pixels across 36,020 frames and demonstrated a 93.23% success rate in reassigning identities during 207 post-occlusion instances. Using LocoTrackAI, we analyzed the locomotor activity of dengue-infected and noninfected mosquitoes across 3.24&amp;nbsp;million recorded mosquito positions. Results revealed that infected mosquitoes exhibited significantly higher locomotor activity (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.0009), with 95,726 movements (0.30 mean locomotor activity) compared to 42,173 movements (0.13 mean locomotor activity) in noninfected mosquitoes, representing more than 200% of the activity of noninfected mosquitoes. Additionally, spatial analysis indicated a more extensive and uniform distribution for infected mosquitoes, with entropy values of 3.38 for infected and 3.13 for noninfected mosquitoes. These findings suggest that dengue infection increases locomotor activity and spatial exploration, potentially enhancing the mosquitoes' capacity to locate hosts and spread the virus. Future studies could expand on this work by investigating the locomotor effects of other arboviruses and further developing tools to automate the analysis of feeding and other critical behaviors.

# Do the Orbitofrontal cortex and the Amygdala encode enough information to detect Small Animal Phobia? A binary support vector machine study

## 眶额皮质和杏仁核是否编码足够的信息来检测小动物恐惧症？二元支持向量机研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6048417/latest

Small animal phobia (SAP) is an anxiety disorder characterized by an intense fear triggered by small animals. Existing studies on SAP have primarily used univariate analyses and small, unbalanced samples, leading to inconsistent findings. Many brain structures have been proposed as potential candidates for encoding SAP, including the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex, the insula, the cingulate gyrus, the hippocampus, the precuneus, and the putamen. However, no previous study has systematically compared the predictive role of each of these regions to determine which one provides the most accurate classification of individuals with SAP. To address this question, we tested the predictive power of these brain regions associated with SAP. Structural MRI images of 32 individuals with SAP and 90 matched healthy controls were analyzed using multiple Binary Support Vector Machines (BSVM). Our results showed that the most critical regions for classifying SAP, in order of significance, were the orbitofrontal cortex (balanced accuracy = 80.83%), the amygdala (76.15%), the insula (71.35%), and the posterior cingulate (71.25%). However, only the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala consistently exceeded chance levels across all additional parameters considered (precision, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score). In conclusion, this study enhances the understanding of the neural basis of small animal phobia, suggesting new research directions and diagnostic strategies using advanced machine learning methods applied to neuroimaging data. Clinical implications are also discussed.

# Machine learning models for predicting medium-term heart failure prognosis: Discrimination and calibration analyses

## 预测中期心力衰竭预后的机器学习模型: 判别和校准分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6008877/latest

The number of patients with heart failure (HF) is increasing with the aging population, shifting care from hospitals to clinics. Although predicting medium-term prognosis after discharge can enhance care and reduce readmissions, yet no established model has been evaluated for both discrimination and calibration. This multicenter study developed and validated machine learning (ML) models&amp;mdash;including logistic regression, random forests, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting&amp;mdash; to predict 180-day mortality or emergency hospitalization in 4,904 HF patients with HF. Patients were randomly split into training and validation sets (8:2), and models were trained and evaluated accordingly.  All models showed acceptable performance based on the area under the precision-recall curve, good calibration according to the calibration slope and Brier score, and effective risk stratification. The SHapley Additive exPlanations algorithm identified nursing care needs as a key predictor alongside established laboratory values for HF prognosis. ML models effectively predict the 180-day prognosis patients with HF, with nursing care needs highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration.
