# Learning group invariant Calabi–Yau metrics by fundamental domain projections

## 通过基本域预测学习组不变calabi-yau度量

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/adb4bb

**Authors:** Yacoub Hendi, Magdalena Larfors and Moritz Walden

We present new invariant machine learning models that approximate the Ricci-flat metric on Calabi–Yau (CY) manifolds with discrete symmetries. We accomplish this by combining state of the art models for predicting such metrics, based on the so-called φ-model of the cymetric package, with non-trainable, G-invariant, canonicalization layers that project the φ-model’s input data (i.e. points sampled from the CY geometry) to the fundamental domain of a given symmetry group G. These G-invariant layers are easy to concatenate, provided one compatibility condition is fulfilled, and combine well with both standard and spectral versions of the φ-model. Through experiments on different CY geometries, we find that, for fixed point sample size and training time, canonicalized models give slightly more accurate metric approximations than the standard φ-model. On highly symmetric spaces, we also observe significantly faster convergence upon training. The method may also be used to compute the Ricci-flat metric on smooth CY quotients. We demonstrate this aspect by experiments on a smooth quotient of a 5-parameter quintic CY manifold.

# AI-driven de-novo design and development of non-toxic DYRK1A inhibitors

## AI驱动的无毒DYRK1A抑制剂的从头设计与开发

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rcx7n-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Guillermo, Marcos-Ayuso

(DYRK1A) plays a key role in various diseases, including DYRK1A syndrome, cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), making it a compelling therapeutic target. This work integrates multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, including predictive models and generative algorithms, to design non-toxic DYRK1A inhibitors. A dual-target drug discovery framework is constructed by combining AI-driven approaches with classical techniques. An ensemble Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model predicts compound affinities, while Directed Message Passing Neural Networks (DMPNN) assess toxicity. In the generative phase, a Hierarchical Graph Generation (HGG) model facilitates the design of potential inhibitors, which are further refined through docking studies, synthesized, and experimentally validated. This approach led to the identification of the pyrazolyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine 1 as a potent DYRK1A inhibitor, prompting the synthesis of a novel derivative series. Enzymatic assays confirmed nanomolar-level inhibitory activity, while ORAC assays and LPS-induced pro-inflammatory response evaluations in BV2 microglial cells demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, these compounds exhibit strong DYRK1A inhibition alongside promising pharmacological effects.

# A Fast Neural Network for Isotopic Charge State Assignment

## 用于同位素电荷状态分配的快速神经网络

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-f2p26?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Lloyd, Smith

Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry is an essential technique for chemical analysis in a range of fields. In ESI, analytes can produce multiple charge states, which must be correctly assigned for identification. Existing approaches to charge state assignment can suffer from limited accuracy and/or poor speed. Here, we developed a fast deep learning neural network to perform isotopic cluster charge assignment. The performance of our algorithm, IsoDec, was demonstrated on top-down proteomics spectra collected on diverse instruments. On these highly complex individual spectra, we found that IsoDec produces similar sequence coverage to existing software tools but with improved accuracy. Importantly, this performance enhancement stems directly from the neural network charge assignment approach, not simply improved scoring and filtering of isotopic clusters. Finally, when applied to large top-down proteomics data sets, we discovered that IsoDec produces proteoform-spectrum matches with a better combination of coverage and accuracy. Overall, IsoDec provides a compelling demonstration of the potential of lightweight neural networks in mass spectrometry data analysis for diverse applications.

# Unraveling the Effects of Pore Size and Diamine Functionalization on CO2 Diffusion in Metal-Organic Frameworks using Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials

## 使用机器学习的原子间势解开孔径和二胺官能化对金属有机框架中CO2扩散的影响

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2r8s1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Chang Seop, Hong

M2(dobdc) (dobdc4- = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), commonly referred to as M-MOF-74, and its variants have been extensively studied for their outstanding CO2 capture performance. In particular, diamine-functionalized M2(dobpdc) (dobpdc4- = 4,4’-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3’-dicarboxylate), an extended analogue of M2(dobdc), has demonstrated exceptional CO2 selectivity under humid conditions owing to its unique cooperative CO2 capture mechanism. Despite these advantages, its CO2 diffusion behavior—a critical parameter for practical applications—remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of pore size and diamine functionalization on CO2 diffusion in Mg2(dobpdc). By employing machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLPs), we achieve quantum-level accuracy within classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enabling the examination of large-scale systems comprising over 4,000 atoms on nanosecond timescales. To elucidate the CO2 diffusion behavior, we compare Mg2(dobpdc) with its smaller-pore counterpart Mg2(dobdc) and larger-pore analogue Mg2(dotpdc) (2,5-dioxido-1,4-terephthalate). Four distinct diamines–m-2 (N-N'-methylethylenediamine), m-2-m (N,N’-dimethylethylenediamine), e-2 (N-ehylethylenediamine), and e-2-e (N,N’-diethylethylenediamine)–are appended to Mg2(dobpdc) and Mg2(dotpdc) to evaluate their influence on CO2 diffusion. The developed MLPs exhibit root mean square errors (RMSEs) of less than 5 meV/atom for energies and 0.3 eV/Å for forces, compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, with MLP-optimized lattice parameters deviating from DFT values by no more than ±2%. For bare MOFs, our MLPs accurately predict CO2 binding enthalpies and the localized CO2 feature near open Mg sites, consistent with experimental observations. This results in low diffusion coefficients (2.0 x 10-11 m2/s – 3.1 x 10-10 m2/s) at low CO2 uptake. For Mg2(dobpdc) and Mg2(dotpdc), which possess larger pore sizes than Mg2(dobdc), the diffusion coefficients increase with increasing CO2 uptake. This trend is attributed to the saturation of Mg sites, which reduces interactions between free CO2 molecules and Mg ions. At one CO2 per Mg, the diffusion coefficients are calculated as 2.1 x 10-9 m2/s and 3.7 x 10-9 m2/s for Mg2(dobpdc) and Mg2(dotpdc), respectively. Diamine functionalization further enhances CO2 diffusion (0.8 x 10-9 m2/s ~ 13.2 x 10-9 m2/s) by reducing access to open Mg sites and introducing complex interactions between diamine units and CO2 and between ammonium carbamate units and CO2. However, at high CO2 loadings, steric hindrance caused by functionalized diamines decreases the diffusion coefficients (1.6 x 10-9 m2/s ~ 6.1 x 10-9 m2/s), particularly in Mg2(dobpdc) due to its smaller pore size relative to Mg2(dotpdc). These findings provide valuable insights into the interplay between pore architecture, functionalization, and CO2 diffusion in bare and diamine-functionalized MOFs. Our results not only deepen the understanding of CO2 capture mechanisms but also provide a framework for designing next-generation materials optimized for carbon capture applications.

# CGsmiles: A Versatile Line Notation for Molecular Representations Across Multiple Resolutions

## CGsmiles: 跨多个分辨率的分子表示的通用线符号

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vhbnq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Peter, Kroon

Coarse-grained (CG) models simplify molecular representations by grouping multiple atoms into effective particles, enabling faster simulations and reducing the chemical compound space compared to atomistic methods. Additionally, models with chemical specificity, such as Martini, may extrapolate to cases where experimental data is scarce, making CG methods highly promising for high-throughput (HT) screenings and chemical space exploration. Yet no rigorous data formats exist for the crucial aspect of describing how the atoms are grouped (i.e., the mapping). As CG models advance toward true HT capabilities, the lack of mappings and indexing capabilities for the growing number of CG molecules poses a significant barrier. To address this, we introduce CGsmiles, a versatile line notation inspired by the popular Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) and BigSMILEs. CGsmiles encodes the molecular graph and particle (atom) properties independent of their resolution and incorporates a framework that allows seamless conversion between coarse- and fine-grained resolutions. By specifying fragments that describe how each particle is represented at the next finer resolution (e.g. CG particles to atoms), CGsmiles can represent multiple resolutions and their hierarchical relationships in a single string. In this paper, we present the CGSmiles syntax and analyze a benchmark set of 407 molecules from the Martini force field. We highlight key features missing in existing notations that are essential for accurately describing CG models. To demonstrate the utility of CGsmiles beyond simulations, we construct two simple machine-learning models for predicting partition coefficients, both trained on CGsmiles-indexed data and leveraging information from both CG and atomistic resolutions. Finally, we briefly discuss the applicability of CGsmiles to polymers, which particularly benefit from the multiresolution nature of the notation.

# Scaffold Hopping with Generative Reinforcement Learning

## 基于生成式强化学习的支架跳跃

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-gd3j4-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Nadine, Schneider

Scaffold hopping – the design of novel scaffolds for existing lead candidates – is a multi-faceted and non-trivial task, for medicinal chemists and computational approaches alike. Generative reinforcement learning can iteratively optimize desirable properties of de novo designs, thereby offering opportunities to accelerate scaffold hopping. Current approaches confine the generation to a pre-defined molecular substructure (e.g., a linker or scaffold) for scaffold hopping. This confined generation may limit the exploration of the chemical space, and require intricate molecule (dis)assembly rules. In this work, we aim to advance reinforcement learning for scaffold hopping, by allowing ‘unconstrained’, full-molecule generation. This is achieved via the RuSH (Reinforcement Learning for Unconstrained Scaffold Hopping) approach. RuSH steers the generation towards the design of full molecules having a high three-dimensional and pharmacophore similarity to a reference molecule, but low scaffold similarity. In this first study, we show the flexibility and effectiveness of RuSH in exploring analogs of known scaffold-hops and in designing scaffold-hopping candidates that match known binding mechanisms. Finally, the comparison between RuSH and two established methods highlights the benefit of its unconstrained molecule generation to systematically achieve scaffold diversity while preserving optimal three-dimensional properties.

# Learning from failures: anatomy and post-mortem analysis of  an unsuccessful search for inhibitors of SARS-CoV2 papain-like protease

## 从失败中学习: 对SARS-CoV2木瓜蛋白酶样蛋白酶抑制剂的失败搜索的解剖和事后分析

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6245x?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Pedro, Silva

Details of failed computer-aided molecular design campaigns are lacking in the published literature due to the prevalent preference for the publication of positive results and successful research narratives. The lessons learned from failed endeavors therefore remain circumscribed to the gray literature and to the institutional memories of research groups, which may prevent the identification of common pitfalls or the sharing of lessons learned from these failures. In this report we describe a promising inhibitor- design campaign which unexpectedly failed in the experimental test phase, and the likely source for that failure. The target protein for this research was the papain-like protease (PLPro) from SARS-CoV2, which cleaves the host's interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein and leads to the weakening of type 1 interferon response. In this work, we have performed a QSAR-based search of the PubChem database to find molecules with higher affinity to PLPro and, consequently, better inhibitory effect than previously-confirmed inhibitor GRL-0167. The 50 detected candidates were docked to the structure of PLPro, and the complexes of the three molecules bound to the experimentally-confirmed S3-S4 pocket were subjected to triplicate molecular dynamics simulations to ascertain the stability of the binding mode. The simulations showed that one of the candidates remained stably bound to the inhibitory pocket. Analysis of binding energies showed that this molecule was at least as good a binder as previously-confirmed inhibitors. Despite such promising results, these candidates failed experimental validation, and a simple, newly-developed, computational protocol identified self-aggregation as the likely reason for this lack of success. Widespread adoption of this simple protocol will highlight ligands prone to this unhelpful behavior, and hopefully increase the success rate of future molecular design campaigns.

# Students&rsquo; Opinion on The Use of The Anatomage Table In Anatomy Learning At The University Of Rwanda

## 学生对卢旺达大学在解剖学学习中使用解剖学表的看法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5987932/latest

Introduction: Anatomy is a major course taken by medical and dental surgery students in their preclinical year, serving as the foundation for patient care in clinical practice. Many preclinical students find anatomy challenging and abstract, highlighting the need for educators to adopt innovative teaching methods, such as utilizing 3D technologies like the Anatomage table. This study aimed to assess the student&rsquo;s opinion on the use of the anatomage table technology on anatomy learning at the University of Rwanda.
Methodology: This cross-sectional study involved 118 first-year preclinical students at the Huye campus of the University of Rwanda. After a month of instruction on selected topics in the Human Anatomy II module (focusing on the trunk, pelvis, and perineum), a Google questionnaire was distributed. Students participated in 32 contact hours, including lectures and practical sessions, prior to completing the questionnaires. The reliability of the questions was assessed using Cronbach's Alpha, and responses were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 5 for "strongly agree" to 1 for "strongly disagree"). Data were analyzed descriptively using Microsoft Excel and SPSS version 21, with a significance level set at P&le;0.05.
Results: The Anatomage table significantly enhanced the understanding of the topics along with dissection (P&le;0.05), visualization of different parts of the human body (P&le;0.05), and the understanding of the anatomical relationships (P&le;0.05).
Conclusion: Anatomage table was helpful in facilitating understanding of the topics and relationships, as well as visualization of anatomical structures.

# Boosting Year 11 Student Motivation and Science Understanding in Gce 'o' Level Combined Science Through the Tpack and Activity Theory (Tpack-at) Framework

## 通过Tpack和活动理论 (Tpack-at) 框架提高Gce “o” 级的11年级学生的动机和科学理解

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6034325/latest

This study examines the impact of science boost camp interventions, utilizing the activity theory and TPACK (AT-TPACK) framework, on the achievements of sixty-eight Year 11 combined science students following the new Cambridge 5129 syllabus, including Paper 3 components, in Muara, Brunei. These students, learning combined science in English as their second language for three years, scored below 60% in their SPE Year 8 science exams, placing them in the Applied Secondary Education Programme (one class of 20 students) and the Special Applied Program (three classes of 48 students). The study uses a pretest-posttest and delayed posttest experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed three-phase AT-TPACK model. The primary goal is to enhance students' combined science achievement and reduce the number of students receiving ungraded (below 30%) grades in the GCE O Level examinations. After the mock exams, the sixty-eight students were randomly assigned to fourteen intervention groups on the basis of their academic performance. Each group, led by a higher achiever (HA) student, participated in science interventions. The study employs an explanatory sequential mixed-method design, analysing both quantitative (preintervention, postintervention, and delayed postintervention test scores) and qualitative data (thematic analysis of transcripts). The results revealed significant improvement in achievement scores postintervention and a reduction in ungraded grades, with thematic analysis indicating sustained retention of scientific concepts even after the 20-week intervention period. Students' GCE O level exam performance improved, with the school achieving its 2023 target for combined science, increasing from 19&amp;ndash;35%, placing the school at the second highest rank in the country. These findings underscore the potential of targeted interventions in addressing challenges in combined science education, offering insights for educators aiming to improve student outcomes in similar contexts.

# Constructing multicancer risk cohorts using national data from medical helplines and secondary care

## 使用来自医疗热线和二级护理的国家数据构建多癌症风险队列

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5701032/latest

Identification of cohorts at higher risk of cancer can enable earlier diagnosis of the disease, which significantly improves patient outcomes. In this study, we use machine learning to predict cancer diagnosis in the next year. We select nine cancer sites with high incidence of late-stage diagnosis or worsening survival rates, and where there are currently no national screening programmes. We use National Health Service (NHS) data from medical helplines (NHS 111) and secondary care appointments from all hospitals in England. We show that features based on information captured in NHS 111 calls are among the most influential in driving predictions of a future cancer diagnosis. Our predictive models exhibit good discrimination (AUC &amp;ndash; 0.78 &amp;ndash; SD 0.04), ranging from 0.69 (ovarian cancer) to 0.83 (oesophageal cancer). While our predictive modelling provides patient level risk predictions, our emphasis is on constructing cohorts of patients who may be at risk of cancer rather than individual risk scores. We present an approach of constructing cohorts at higher risk of cancer based on feature importance and considering possible bias in model results. These outputs can be used to develop highly targeted case finding services, which could help increase earlier detection rates and reduce health disparities. This approach is flexible and can be tailored based on the group the intervention targets (i.e. symptomatic or asymptomatic patients) and the data available to those charged with administering the intervention.

# TCM_DiffPR: Graph Knowledge Diffusion Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Personalized Recommendation

## TCM_DiffPR: 中医个性化推荐的图知识扩散模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6047566/latest

With the rapid development of modern Chinese medicine prescription recommendation technology based on artificial intelligence technology, the existing herb recommendation model lacks attention to the personalized attributes of the patient, ignoring the important factors of the clinical diagnosis and treatment process of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). To address this problem, we propose a novel Graph Knowledge Diffusion Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Personalized Recommendation (TCM_DiffPR). Firstly, the patient's personalized attribute information is used to obtain symptom representations by means of &lsquo;prompt fine-tuning&rsquo;, and the prompt is enhanced by pre-training model with prompt-oriented comparative learning. Secondly, the algorithm combines the generative model with the data augmentation paradigm based on knowledge graph diffusion, which compensates for the misinterpretation of symptom preferences in the knowledge graph (KG) to achieve powerful knowledge learning. Finally, we introduce a collaborative knowledge graph convolution mechanism, which combines collaborative signals reflecting the symptom-herbal medication interaction patterns, to guide the knowledge graph diffusion process. In this study, experimental comparative analyses are conducted on two public datasets and a clinical dataset, and the results show that the present algorithm outperforms existing TCM prescription recommendation methods and provides an effective reference basis for clinical diagnosis and decision support.
