<p>Nature Communications, Published online: 08 February 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56783-0">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-56783-0</a></p>Single-cell replication timing (scRT) studies in cancer are challenging due to genomic heterogeneity. Here, the authors develop MnM, a machine learning tool that can provide heterogeneity-resolved scRT profiles, and apply it to a large single-cell dataset that includes tumours, cell lines, and patient-derived xenografts.
