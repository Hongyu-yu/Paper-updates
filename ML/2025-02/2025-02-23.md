<p>Nature Communications, Published online: 22 February 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57101-4">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-57101-4</a></p>Molecular dynamics simulations using machine learning interatomic potentials often face stability issues due to distribution shifts. Here, the authors develop an online test-time adaptation framework to improve generalization, allowing for more stable simulations without the need for additional training data.
