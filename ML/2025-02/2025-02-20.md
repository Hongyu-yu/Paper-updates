# State-to-state integral cross sections for the Cl + CHD 3  ( v  CH  = 0,1) → HCl + CD 3  reactions

## Cl CHD 3 ( v CH = 0,1) → HCl CD 3反应的状态到状态积分截面

<span class="paragraphSection">To precisely study the effect of CH stretch excitation, we calculate the first seven-dimensional state-to-state integral cross sections (ICSs) for the Cl + CHD<sub>3</sub>(<span style="font-style: italic;">v</span><sub>CH</sub> = 0,1) → HCl + CD<sub>3</sub> reactions using the time-dependent wave-packet approach on a highly accurate fundamental invariant neural network potential energy surface. Compared to experiments that focus solely on CD<sub>3</sub>(<span style="font-style: italic;">v</span><sub>2</sub> = 0), our theoretical calculations give a more global picture. It is found that the vibrational enhancement factors of the total ICS are less than 1 only in the very low collision energy region (&lt;0.55 kcal/mol); moreover, the CH stretch-excited reaction also produces vibrationally cold HCl. These two findings indicate that Polanyi’s rules apply to this late-barrier polyatomic reaction, not only in terms of the energy requirement in the breaking bond but also in the energy disposal in the newly formed bond. In addition, although the experimental and theoretical product HCl(<span style="font-style: italic;">v</span><sub>1</sub> = 1) branching fractions for CD<sub>3</sub>(<span style="font-style: italic;">v</span><sub>2</sub> = 0) are in quantitative agreement, the new quantum vibrational enhancement factor for CD<sub>3</sub>(<span style="font-style: italic;">v</span><sub>2</sub> = 0) is ∼2.7 times greater than the experimental results.</span>

# Characterizing the photodissociation dynamics of HPCO in the S 1  band

<span class="paragraphSection">A full-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) represented by the neural network method for the first excited state S<sub>1</sub>(<sup>1</sup><span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>″) of HPCO is reported for the first time. The PES was constructed based on more than 51 000 <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> points, which were calculated at the multi-reference configuration interaction level with Davidson correction using the augmented correlation consistent polarized valence triple zeta basis set. Based on the newly constructed PES, quasi-classical trajectory calculations were carried out to study the photodissociation dynamics of HPCO at the total energy ranging from 4.0 to 5.6 eV. At low total energies, the HP + CO product is dominant, while the product H + PCO becomes increasingly favored at higher energies. Furthermore, the translational energy distributions of two products are found to be energy-dependent. Owing to the strongly repulsive PES along the HP + CO dissociation pathway, the translational energy distributions of HP + CO are dominated by relatively higher energies in contrast to H + PCO. The diatomic products HP and CO are found to possess the vibrational distributions decaying monotonically with the vibrational quantum number and relatively cold rotational state distributions, consistent with the strongly repulsive potentials toward the HP + CO channel. In addition, the vibrational distributions of HP and CO are found to be quite similar due to their close frequencies, while the rotational distributions of CO have a much more highly excited rotational degree of freedom owing to its rotational constant approximately four times smaller than that of HP.</span>

# Scattering-based structural inversion of soft materials via Kolmogorov–Arnold networks

## 基于kolmogorov-arnold网络的软材料散射结构反演

Link: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/162/7/074106/3336318/Scattering-based-structural-inversion-of-soft

<span class="paragraphSection">Small-angle scattering techniques are indispensable tools for probing the structure of soft materials. However, traditional analytical models often face limitations in structural inversion for complex systems, primarily due to the absence of closed-form expressions of scattering functions. To address these challenges, we present a machine learning framework based on the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) for directly extracting real-space structural information from scattering spectra in reciprocal space. This model-independent, data-driven approach provides a versatile solution for analyzing intricate configurations in soft matter. By applying the KAN to lyotropic lamellar phases and colloidal suspensions—two representative soft matter systems—we demonstrate its ability to accurately and efficiently resolve structural collectivity and complexity. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing the quantitative analysis of soft materials, paving the way for robust structural inversion across diverse systems.</span>

# A graph neural network simulation of dispersed systems

## 分散系统的图神经网络仿真

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/adb0a0

**Authors:** Aref Hashemi and Aliakbar Izadkhah

We present a graph neural network (GNN) that accurately simulates a multidisperse suspension of interacting spherical particles. Our machine learning framework is built upon the recent work of Sanchez-Gonzalez et al (2020 ICML vol 119 (PMLR) pp 8459–68) on graph network simulators, and efficiently learns the intricate dynamics of the interacting particles. Nodes and edges of the GNN correspond, respectively, to the particles with their individual properties/data (e.g. radius, position, velocity) and the pairwise interactions between the particles (e.g. electrostatics, hydrodynamics). A key contribution of our work is to account for the finite dimensions of the particles and their impact on the system dynamics. We test our GNN against a representative case study of a multidisperse mixture of two-dimensional spheres sedimenting under gravity in a liquid and interacting with each other by a Lennard–Jones potential. The present GNN framework offers a fast and accurate method for the theoretical study of complex physical systems such as field-induced behavior of colloidal suspensions and ionic liquids. Our implementation of the GNN is available on GitHub at github.com/rfjd/GNS-DispersedSystems.

# Graphically-Defined Model Reactions are Extensible, Accurate, and Systematically Improvable

## 图形定义的模型反应是可扩展的、准确的和系统改进的

**Authors:** Hsuan-Hao, Hsu

Achieving fast and accurate reaction prediction is central to a suite of chemical applications.  Nevertheless, classic approaches based on templates or simple models are typically fast but with limited scope or accuracy, while the emerging machine learning-based models are limited in their transferability due to the lack of large reaction databases. Here, we address these limitations by formalizing the model reaction concept based on fixed-depth condensed reaction graphs that are shown to achieve a cost and accuracy balance that is applicable to many problems. The model reaction concept can be utilized to provide reliable predictions of activation energies and transition state geometries for a large range of organic reactions. In addition, using an alkane pyrolysis system as a benchmarking example, we show that the accuracy of the activation energy prediction can be further improved by adding correction terms based on the empirical Br{\o}nsted-Evans-Pokanyi (BEP) relationship. These successful applications demonstrate that the model reaction can serve as a general tool to reduce the cost associated with ab initio transition state searches.

# Exploring BERT for Reaction Yield Prediction: Evaluating the Impact of Tokenization,  Molecular Representation, and Pre-training Data Augmentation

## 探索BERT用于反应产率预测: 评估标记化，分子表示和预训练数据增强的影响

**Authors:** Peter, Pogány

Predicting reaction yields in synthetic chemistry remains a significant challenge. This study  systematically evaluates the impact of tokenization, molecular representation, pre-training data, and adversarial  training on a BERT-based model for yield prediction of Buchwald-Hartwig and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions  using publicly available HTE datasets. We demonstrate that molecular representation choice (SMILES,  DeepSMILES, SELFIES, Morgan fingerprint-based notation, IUPAC names) has minimal impact on model  performance, while typically BPE and SentencePiece tokenization outperform other methods. WordPiece is  strongly discouraged for SELFIES and fingerprint-based notation. Furthermore, pre-training with relatively small  data sets (<100K reactions) achieves comparable performance to larger data sets containing millions of examples. A use of artificially generated domain-specific pre-training data is proposed. The artificially generated sets prove  to be a good surrogate to the reaction schemes extracted from reaction data sets such as Pistachio or Reaxys. The best performance was observed for hybrid pre-training sets combining the real and the domain-specific, artificial data. Finally, we show that a novel adversarial training approach, perturbing input embeddings  dynamically, improves model robustness and generalisability for yield and reaction success prediction. These  findings provide valuable insights for developing robust and practical machine learning models for yield  prediction in synthetic chemistry. GSK’s BERT training code base is made available to the community with this  work.

# Machine learning-guided materials and system co-design for high-pressure hydrogen compression

## 机器学习引导的高压氢气压缩材料与系统协同设计

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-352vm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Terry, Johnson

Cost effective and reliable hydrogen compression remains a challenging barrier in the wide-spread adoption of hydrogen as an energy carrier. The prevailing technology of mechanical compression suffers from several drawbacks, some of which can be addressed by non-mechanical compression strategies (e.g., electrochemical or metal hydride-based thermal compression). Thermally driven metal hydride compression strategies typically rely on multi-stage metal hydride-based compressors; however, discovering or optimizing low-stability metal hydrides that can pressurize hydrogen upwards of 1000 bar is difficult, both with respect to computational predictions and experimental validation. Here we (1) demonstrate that simple machine learning-derived design rules can inform rational design of alloying strategies yielding low-stability hydrides, (2) validate their experimental pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) isotherms up to 875 bar, and (3) utilize a dynamic systems-level model of a metal hydride compressor design to evaluate their performance under realistic operating conditions. Importantly, this analysis yields predicted operational efficiencies of both 2-stage (90-875 bar) and 3-stage (20-875 bar) metal hydride compressors to enable further evaluation of this technology and its techno-economic outlook.

**Authors:** Süleyman, Er

Developing cost-effective organic molecules with robust redox activity and high solubility is crucial for widespread acceptance and deployment of aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). We present RedCat, an automated workflow designed to accelerate the discovery of redox-active organic molecules from extensive molecular databases. This workflow employs structure-based selection, machine learning models for predicting redox reaction energy and aqueous solubility, and dynamically integrates up-to-date pricing data to prioritize candidates. Applying this workflow to 112 million molecules from the PubChem database, we identified 261 promising anolyte candidates. We validated their battery-related properties through first-principles and molecular dynamics calculations and experimentally tested two electrochemically active molecules. These molecules demonstrated higher energy densities than previously reported compounds, confirming the robustness of our workflow in discovering electrolytes. With its open-access code repository and modular design, RedCat is well-suited for integration into self-driving labs, offering a scalable framework for autonomous, data-driven electrolyte discovery.

## 基于u-hrct的耳蜗自动分割与测量模型的构建及临床应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5972058/latest

Objectives
In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data acquisition for cochlear structure, this study built an intelligent segmentation and automatic measurement model of cochlear based on U-HRCT to solve the difficulty of performing an accurate preoperative evaluation of the cochlea.
Methods
The data of 86 patients (172 ears in total) who received U-HRCT and were diagnosed with normal ears were retrospectively collected. In this study, TransUnet neural network was used to construct automatic segmentation model of cochlear, 7 direct measurement indexes were selected and 3 indirect measurement indexes were defined. The effect of automatic segmentation was evaluated by subjective method, compared with manual measured data, and the influencing factors of cochlear structure were analyzed by multiple linear regression method. Finally, the Violin Plot method is used to calculate the normal value range of cochlear structural parameters.
Results
The index of automatic segmentation DSC reached 98%, and the results of automatic measurement were consistent with those of manual measurement (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Except for regularity parameters CCR and HRD, cochlear structural parameters had high correlation with gender (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and except volume related parameters VOL and VRD, cochlear structural parameters had low correlation with age (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Except VRD, the correlation between the cochlear structure parameter and the location was low (P &amp;gt; 0.05).
Conclusions
This study built an automatic segmentation and measurement model of cochlear structure, obtained the reference value range of cochlear structure parameters, and provided reference data for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
Clinical relevance statement
The above indexes have important reference value for the automatic identification of cochlear structural abnormalities in clinic, and in-depth data mining of case samples will be carried out in subsequent studies.

# Opportunities to enhance conservation success for sharks

## 提高鲨鱼保护成功的机会

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4950738/latest

Sharks, rays, and chimaeras are among the most threatened vertebrate lineages. Despite considerable conservation efforts, the extinction risk of sharks continues to rise. We present a quantitative analysis of the shark conservation literature, exploring trends and interconnectivities in key topics using a machine learning approach. We show that shark conservation research is a well interconnected, coherently structured, and rapidly expanding field centred around a conservation nexus linking human-wildlife interactions to species use and management. Shark conservation research is increasingly interdisciplinary and is well prioritised toward key threats that drive the decline of shark populations, both of which are key to effective management. However, we also identify opportunities to further strengthen research and management. These include improved integration of key research topics, enhancing the understanding of combined threats, and greater consideration for the role of sub-lethal impacts. Lastly, we stress that meaningful integration of research topics, rather than simple contextualisation, is essential to building the comprehensive and nuanced understanding necessary to inform effective conservation actions. By leveraging the strengths of the field and addressing its remaining weaknesses, there is hope for a future where sharks thrive and contribute to healthy, resilient marine ecosystems.

# Low-temperature molten salt enabled synthesis of solid-state emissive carbon dots with high endurance and &amp;gt;99% quantum yields

## 低温熔盐能够合成具有高耐久性和&gt; 99% 量子产率的固态发射碳点

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5969251/latest

Fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) have garnered significant attention for their unique optoelectronic properties and applications, but their practical employment is hampered by the excessive synthesis temperature, tedious post-processing and limited solid-state luminescence efficiency. Herein, we develop a facile molten salt method to achieve the one-step synthesis of full-color CDs with efficient solid-state emission. Comprehensively, kilogram-scale solid-state CDs with a quantum yield of 90% can be readily synthesized via a salt-assisted approach under mild conditions (100&amp;ndash;142&amp;deg;C) within 10 minutes. The spectral characterization and density functional theory calculation confirm that zinc ion coordination can occur in liquated environment, which facilitates the polymerization of precursors at lower temperatures, suppresses the formation of non-radiative recombination channels on their surface, and further enhances luminescence in solid. The machine learning is further used to optimize CDs&amp;rsquo; luminous efficiency up to 99.86%, evoking excellent performance CDs-based light-emitting diodes with a maximum luminous efficiency of 156.29 lm W&amp;ndash;1 to drive backlit display with a long-persistent lifetime (T95 at 100 cd m&amp;ndash;2 = 45108.7 h). This work provides a pathway for the design and fabrication of advanced carbon-based solid-state luminescent materials, significantly contributing to the advancement of next-generation lighting and display technologies.

# Post-Election Anxiety on Academic Performance Among Senior High School Teachers and Students in Ghana: A Case of Twifo Hemang Lower Denkyira District, Central Region

## 加纳高中师生选举后焦虑对学业成绩的影响 -- 以中部地区Twifo Hemang下登基拉区为例

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6049513/latest

Elections serve as a fundamental element of democracy and frequently induce strong emotions and political tensions, which can greatly affect societal well-being like education. This research examines post-election anxiety among senior high school teachers and students, specifically in Twifo Hemang Lower Denkyira District in the Central Region of Ghana. It focuses on its psychological, social, and educational consequences. Although there is extensive global research regarding election-related anxiety, there has been limited focus on its impact on educational stakeholders in sub-Saharan Africa. This study addresses this gap by examining the experiences, coping strategies, and educational consequences of post-election anxiety in Ghana. This study employed a qualitative research design based on phenomenology. The study gathered insights from 10 teachers and 15 students through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. These participants were carefully and purposefully selected to ensure a range of perspectives. Thematic analysis showed that post-election anxiety negatively affected the mental health of both teachers and students, which hampered teacher effectiveness and reduced student engagement and academic performance. Teachers reported feeling emotionally drained and less motivated, whereas students encountered increased anxiety and a diminished ability to concentrate on their studies. Coping strategies differed because teachers often found comfort in social interactions and political discourse, while students had difficulty managing their anxieties. The results highlight the pressing need to incorporate mental health and emotional resilience programs into educational policies because it will help lessen disruptions in the teaching and learning process to preserve academic outcomes. This research illustrates the link between political events and educational well-being, calling for proactive measures to foster a supportive learning environment. Policymakers and educational leaders need to prioritise mental health resources in schools to ensure resilience during election periods. Educational institutions can sustain continuity and promote a more stable and effective academic environment in times of political instability when post-election anxiety is addressed to the barest minimum.

# Pharmacist-led prescription writing educational intervention to final-year medical students: A pre-post nonrandomised longitudinal study

## 药剂师主导的对最后一年医学生的处方写作教育干预: 一项非随机纵向研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5823347/latest

Background
The skill of writing a medication prescription is multifaceted, incorporating multiple layers and dimensions. Prescribing is a competency expected of all junior doctors, however, many medical students feel a lack of preparedness and confidence to complete a medication prescription once graduated. Teaching the practical and clinical components separately may enhance understanding of the practical skill of prescribing prior to integrating the clinical knowledge to complete a medication prescription.
The primary objective of this study is to determine if pharmacist-led multimodal education interventions change the prescribing skills of Australian final-year medical students. Our secondary aim is to review knowledge retention of prescribing skills in these same participants a year later as junior doctors. Thirdly, we aim to determine if there is an association between participants&rsquo; self-perceived confidence to prescribe and their practical ability to write safe and legal prescriptions. This manuscript will describe in detail the methods of this novel longitudinal study.
Methods
This is a nonrandomised pre-post longitudinal study to be conducted in two phases. The control for the study is students receiving curricula-based education throughout their medical degree. The intervention is pharmacist-led multimodal education (face-to-face, case-based learning with hands on experiences, online module, and placement) on prescription writing skills to final-year medical students.
This study has been approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (H9114).
Discussion
This paper presents the methods and protocol of an approved and funded nonrandomised longitudinal study to investigate the potential of pharmacist educators to durably improve prescribing knowledge and skills amongst Australian final year medical students. Prescribing skills education for medical students may reduce the probability of potential incorrect or unsafe prescribing habits as junior doctors. Education standards do not acknowledge adhering to local legal regulations when prescribing and do not recommend mandatory teaching or assessment criteria. This study will review the effectiveness and need for additional education on the practical skill of writing a medication prescription. If positive, the findings of this study will have practical and policy impacts that may result in long term improvement in safe medicines practice and ultimately benefit patient care.

# Artificial Intelligence-Driven Comparison of Platelet-Rich Plasma and Hyaluronic Acid Efficacy in Knee Osteoarthritis Treatment: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial

## 人工智能驱动的富血小板血浆与透明质酸治疗膝骨关节炎疗效比较: 一项前瞻性随机对照试验

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6000459/latest

Background: Despite the widespread use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) management, their comparative efficacy remains controversial. This study aimed to systematically evaluate their therapeutic effects through artificial intelligence-based analysis of clinical and molecular outcomes.Methods: In this prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 140 patients with KOA were randomly assigned to receive either PRP (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;70) or HA (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;70) treatment. Clinical assessments included WOMAC, KOOS, and VAS scores, while molecular evaluation focused on inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1&beta;, TNF-&alpha;, hs-CRP). A deep learning model was developed to predict treatment outcomes and identify key predictive factors. Primary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 months post-treatment.Results: PRP demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy across multiple parameters. At 12-month follow-up, the PRP group showed significantly greater improvements in pain reduction (SMD&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.82; 95% CI: 0.45&amp;ndash;1.19; P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001) and inflammatory marker suppression (IL-1&beta; reduction: 51.2%, P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001) compared to the HA group. The artificial intelligence model achieved exceptional predictive performance (AUC&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1.000) in treatment outcome prediction. IL-1&beta; emerged as the strongest predictor of treatment response (SHAP value: 0.185, P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001), followed by WOMAC scores (0.175, P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed optimal model performance in patients under 60 years (accuracy: 90.5%, 95% CI: 88.2%-92.8%).Discussion: Our findings extend beyond previous studies by demonstrating PRP's superior efficacy through both clinical and molecular evidence. The marked reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-1&beta;, suggests that PRP's therapeutic mechanism involves significant immunomodulation. The developed AI model's exceptional predictive accuracy offers a promising tool for treatment optimization, while the identification of key predictive biomarkers provides new insights into patient stratification. The enhanced efficacy in younger patients and those with moderate disease severity suggests optimal timing for PRP intervention, though the slightly lower prediction accuracy in severe cases indicates the need for careful patient selection.Conclusions: This study provides robust evidence for PRP's superior efficacy in KOA treatment through comprehensive clinical and molecular analyses. The developed artificial intelligence model demonstrates remarkable potential for personalizing treatment selection, with inflammatory markers serving as key predictive indicators. These findings advance the field of personalized medicine in osteoarticular diseases by establishing a framework for precision treatment planning.

# Nonlinear Optical Vector Processing at 50 Gbs using Linear Silicon Photonic Circuits

## 使用线性硅光子电路在50 Gbs下进行非线性光学矢量处理

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5928777/latest

The need for high-speed, energy-efficient computing in machine learning and real-time communication necessitates innovations beyond conventional digital and analog electronics to sustain computational power advances without requiring prohibitive energy amounts. Photonics has emerged as a promising platform demonstrating significant highlights in the field of linear transformations. Adopting, however, the use of photons within a broad range of computing applications necessitates their successful employment also in nonlinear vector processing and matching functionalities, which still continue to comprise the stronghold of electronics. In this direction, we demonstrate nonlinear optical vector processing in the form of Hamming Distance (HD) calculation and Content Addressable Memory (CAM) bank operations using linear optical circuits on Silicon photonics (SiPho) at a record-high-speed of 50 Gb/s, enabling advances in pattern matching, error-correction and look-up tables. The processor employs a 4&amp;times;4 crossbar architecture with 56 GHz SiGe electro-absorption modulators to compute HD between 2-bit optical vectors. It achieves error-rates of ~&amp;thinsp;10⁻&amp;sup3; in CAM and ternary CAM applications that correspond to zero HD, improving state-of-the-art CAM speed performance by &amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;2.5x. Scalability is enhanced by employing space-wavelength multiplexing schemes via a WDM-enabled SiPho processor cell, which is experimentally demonstrated at 50 Gb/s and offers the potential to increase the computational capacity in a reduced insertion loss and power consumption envelope. The realization of HD calculation and CAM matchline operations via linear optical transformations can pave the inroad towards implementing additional nonlinear optical vector transformation processes at high data-rates via linear silicon photonic circuits, like the calculation of Euclidean distance and Cosine distance metrics.

# A Deep Learning-Augmented Density Functional Framework for Reaction Modeling with Chemical Accuracy

## 具有化学精度的反应建模的深度学习增强密度泛函框架

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6041159/latest

Accurate prediction of reaction energetics remains a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry, as conventional density functional theory (DFT) often fails to reconcile high accuracy with computational effi ciency. Here, we introduce Deep post-Hartree-Fock (DeePHF), a machine learning framework that synergistically integrates neural networks with quantum mechanical descriptors to achieve CCSD(T)-level precision while retaining the efficiency of DFT. By establishing a direct mapping between the eigenvalues of local density matrices and high-level correlation energies, DeePHF circumvents the traditional accuracy-scalability trade-off . Trained on a limited dataset of small-molecule reactions, our method demonstrates unprecedented performance across multiple benchmark datasets, exhibiting exceptional transferability. In fact, its accuracy even surpasses that of advanced double-hybrid functionals, all while maintaining O(N^3) scaling. DeePHF offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between high-level quantum chemistry methods and the practical demands for scalable, accurate models in computational chemistry, and with further refinement, it is poised to make significant contributions to the advancement of chemical reaction modeling.

# The Role of Academic Challenge and Support in Promoting Sustainable Student Development in Higher Education

## 学术挑战和支持在促进高等教育学生可持续发展中的作用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5931990/latest

The reconciliation between the academic challenge students face and the academic support they receive within a university environment has been identified as a significant factor in their sustainable development. This study sought to explore the pathways through which academic support and academic challenge affect the sustainable development of college students in China. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey was conducted on undergraduate learning and development among 1,104 students at a comprehensive, research-oriented, key national university in China, and the data were analysed using the challenge&amp;ndash;support theory as a framework. The results indicated that the academic challenges posed by learning strategies and academic expectations positively affected student sustainable development. Academic support was also found to have a positive effect on student sustainable development and mediate the relationship between academic expectations and student sustainable development, as well as between learning strategies and student sustainable development. The study&amp;rsquo;s results can be used as a practical guide for higher education institutions to promote student sustainable development based on the challenge&amp;ndash;support theory.

# Machine Learning Investigation of Electroporation of Cell Clusters in Cancer Therapy Using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference and Finite Element Modeling

## 使用自适应神经模糊推理和有限元建模的癌症治疗中细胞簇电穿孔的机器学习研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6048726/latest

Exposing biological cells to an external electric field results in an induced transmembrane voltage (ITV) on the cell membrane, which, under the right conditions may result in reversible permeabilization. This process, called electroporation, has been used to deliver drugs during cancer therapy, DNA transfection or transformation, direct transfer of plasmids between cells and gene therapy. Given the broad importance of these applications, fundamental understanding and optimization of electroporation is critically needed. Towards this goal, this work utilizes machine learning techniques to study the influence of cell-cell interactions on ITV during electropermeabilization. In the first part of the study, the ITV of a cell positioned at the center of a cell cluster is studied. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model combined with finite-element simulations is used to develop a tool to predict the electroporated cell surface area (ECSA) without the need for cumbersome measurements or time-intensive simulations. The finite-element simulations were used to compute the electric potential distribution in the media during electroporation of a single cell or cluster of cells. This approach is shown to be able to accurately predict the ECSA during electroporation. Results indicate that the packing ratio (PR) of the cell cluster plays a key role in determining the ITV, particularly when the PR is less than 3. The sensitivity is much reduced for larger values of PR. The ANFIS model showed a 96.6% coefficient of determination and 1.46 root mean square error, showing that the ANFIS model is a reasonably accurate and robust approach for prediction of ECSA. A key result from this work is that a higher amplitude of AEF is needed to have higher ECSA when PR decreases. Insights gained from this work may contribute towards investigating other types of cancer with various cell densities with the aim of determining optimal electric field parameters.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women, following lung cancer, as of 2024. Conventional cancer diagnosis relies on manual examination of biopsied tissues by pathologists which is a time-consuming process and based on pathologist experience may vary. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for effective treatment planning and patient care. The invention of whole-slide scanners has revolutionized this process by enabling the adoption of Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems for automated analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within CAD systems play a pivotal role in the automated classification of breast tissues. This study utilizes state-of-the-art CNNs called EfficientNetV1 and EfficientNetV2 for binary classification of BreakHis dataset ,a collection of histopathological images categorized as benign and malignant breast tissues. To address the challenge posed by the limited availability of annotated data, data augmentation and transfer learning techniques were applied. Model interpretability was enhanced using the Grad-CAM technique, which generates localization maps highlighting critical regions relevant to predictions. Finally, ensemble learning is employed for further improving performance. we utilized unweighted averaging and majority voting to combine predictions of multiple trained models. Furthermore, We define two ensemble architecture combining different trained EfficientNets. The proposed framework was able to achieve a classification accuracy of 99.58% outperforming conventional CNN models on BreakHis dataset. This study underscores the potential of ensemble learning to improve diagnostics accuracy in breast cancer detection.

Introduction of new programs in educational institutions in Ghana requires the introduction of a new curriculum. However, the performance of the new programs after the admission of students into the programs becomes questionable as the least performance is achieved. As Ghanaian univer- sities continue to expand their curriculum to meet the evolving demands of the digital economy, understanding the perceptions and experiences of the academic community becomes essential for gauging the success and potential areas for improvement of these programs. The study performs a supervised sentiment analysis on reviews gathered from students enrolled in new academic pro- grams towards the recommendation of the programs to people. The primary data for this study were drawn from a sample of 226 students, using both open-ended and closed-ended structured questionnaires. In the study, four machine learning methods, including Multinomial Naı̈ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest were applied. The methods are compared, and the empirical findings reveal that the Support Vector Machine and Random For- est approaches outperformed the Multinomial Naı̈ve Bayes and Logistic Regression approaches, resulting in generally positive sentiment towards the performance of the new academic programs. By analyzing the sentiments of students, the study recommends actionable insights that can guide the university in enhancing its academic offerings and aligning them with the expectations of its community.
