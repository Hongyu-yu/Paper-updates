<span class="paragraphSection">Liquid gallium exhibits a unique metallic-covalent coexistence. Leveraging the volume constant pressure molecular dynamics method and a well-trained neural network potential, we study the evolution of liquid Ga surface structures under varying temperatures and pressures. Our study presents a schematic P–T phase diagram of the liquid surface. We observe symmetric static structure factor main peaks in the outermost layers of the liquid Ga surface compared with asymmetric ones for inner layers, indicating a simple liquid behavior and a lack of Ga<sub>2</sub> dimers at the surface. We calculate the surface energy and the surface tension, which reveal non-monotonic changes. All these results provide a further insight into understanding the physics of the strange metal gallium.</span>

# Leveraging multi-task learning regressor chains for small and sparse tabular data in materials design

## 在材料设计中利用多任务学习回归链处理小而稀疏的表格数据

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/adae53

**Authors:** Felix Conrad, Hajo Wiemer and Steffen Ihlenfeldt

Machine learning has become increasingly important in materials design, yet traditional single-task learning (STL) models fail to fully exploit the potential of available data in scenarios involving multiple targets and incomplete datasets. While STL models overlook the inherent correlations between target properties, this study showcases how multi-task learning (MTL) effectively leverages these correlations. Therefore, the performance of MTL methods compared to STL is evaluated across five datasets, covering twelve prediction tasks and incorporating different types and levels of data sparsity. Our findings reveal that MTL significantly outperforms STL, particularly in sparse data scenarios, with up to 15% prediction improvements across all tasks. Moreover, MTL methods utilizing regressor chains with automated machine learning tools achieve superior performance compared to those based on neural networks, with minimal training effort required. This work advances data efficiency in data-driven materials design, establishing MTL as a potent tool for simultaneous learning and predicting multiple material properties.

# LTAU-FF: Loss Trajectory Analysis for Uncertainty in atomistic Force Fields

## Ltau-ff: 原子力场中不确定性的损失轨迹分析

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/adb4b9

**Authors:** Joshua A Vita, Amit Samanta, Fei Zhou and Vincenzo Lordi

Model ensembles are effective tools for estimating prediction uncertainty in deep learning atomistic force fields. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by high computational costs and overconfident error estimates. In this work, we address these challenges by leveraging distributions of per-sample errors obtained during training and employing a distance-based similarity search in the model latent space. Our method, which we call LTAU (Loss Trajectory Analysis for Uncertainty), efficiently estimates the full probability distribution function of errors for any test point using the logged training errors, achieving speeds that are 2–3 orders of magnitudes faster than typical ensemble methods and allowing it to be used for tasks where training or evaluating multiple models would be infeasible. We apply LTAU towards estimating parametric uncertainty in atomistic force fields (LTAU-FF), demonstrating that it produces well-calibrated confidence intervals and predicts errors that correlate strongly with the true errors for data near the training domain. Furthermore, we show that the errors predicted by LTAU-FF can be used in practical applications for detecting out-of-domain data, tuning model performance, and predicting failure during simulations. We believe that LTAU will be a valuable tool for uncertainty quantification in atomistic force fields and is a promising method that should be further explored in other domains of machine learning.

# Validating large-scale quantum machine learning: efficient simulation of quantum support vector machines using tensor networks

## 验证大规模量子机器学习: 使用张量网络高效模拟量子支持向量机

**Authors:** Kuan-Cheng Chen, Tai-Yue Li, Yun-Yuan Wang, Simon See, Chun-Chieh Wang, Robert Wille, Nan-Yow Chen, An-Cheng Yang and Chun-Yu Lin

We present an efficient tensor-network-based approach for simulating large-scale quantum circuits exemplified by quantum support vector machines (QSVMs). Experimentally, leveraging the cuTensorNet library on multiple GPUs, our method effectively reduces the exponential runtime growth to near-quadratic scaling with respect to the number of qubits in practical scenarios. Traditional state-vector simulations become computationally infeasible beyond approximately 50 qubits; in contrast, our simulator successfully handles QSVMs with up to 784 qubits, executing simulations within seconds on a single high-performance GPU. Furthermore, utilizing the message passing interface for multi-GPU environments, our method demonstrates strong linear scalability, effectively decreasing computation time as dataset sizes increase. We validate our framework using the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving successful multiclass classification and highlighting the potential of QSVMs for high-dimensional data analysis. By integrating tensor-network techniques with advanced high-performance computing resources, this work demonstrates both the feasibility and scalability of simulating large-qubit quantum machine learning models, providing a valuable validation tool within the emerging Quantum-HPC ecosystem.

# Overcoming sparse datasets with multi-task learning as applied to high entropy alloys

## 通过应用于高熵合金的多任务学习克服稀疏数据集

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/adb53c

**Authors:** Arindam Debnath and Wesley F Reinhart

The design of novel High Entropy Alloys for use in high-temperature applications is an area of active interest due to their potential to provide exceptional properties compared to conventional alloys. Since the increased popularity of machine learning, an important cog in the design process has been training surrogate models on alloy properties. However, these Single-Task models are trained on individual mechanical properties and do not take advantage of the relatedness between properties. Multi-Task models can capture the interdependencies between tasks, leading to potentially more accurate predictions for all tasks. In this paper, we investigate if Multi-Task models can show improvement over Single-Task models when used for predicting the mechanical properties of these alloys. To ensure fair evaluation between the models, we apply L0 regularization and skip connections to the models, which allows them to adjust the number of model parameters and depth for optimal performance. We find that the Multi-Task models can leverage task relationships to perform better than Single-Task models, especially for high amounts of missing data in the tasks. Furthermore, adding simple auxiliary targets can boost Multi-Task performance even further despite not being effective as input descriptors to single-task models themselves. We anticipate that the proposed strategies can achieve more accurate predictions and consequently enable better design capabilities for such data-constrained domains without incurring much additional computational cost.

**Authors:** Eduardo, García-Verdugo

Digital technologies, including artificial intelligence and additive manufacturing advancements, have revolutionized all areas of chemistry and chemical engineering. In the field of reactor engineering, the development of novel geometries has enabled improved performance. However, until now the design has been largely relying on human design. This study introduces Reac-Discovery, a digital platform that integrates the generation, fabrication, and optimization of catalytic reactors based on periodic open-cell structures (POCs). It integrates the parametric design and analysis of advanced structures from mathematic models (Reac-Gen), the high-resolution 3D printing and functionalization of catalytic reactors (Reac-Fab) with an algorithm that validates the printability of reactor designs and a self-driving laboratory platform (Reac-Eval) capable of parallel multi-reactor evaluations featuring real-time NMR monitoring and machine learning (ML) simultaneous optimization of process parameters and topologic descriptors. Reac-Discovery can iteratively, dynamically, and rapidly refine reactor designs and reaction conditions, enabling the discovery of optimal geometries for industrially relevant processes.  The heterogeneously catalyzed CO₂ cycloaddition at low pressure was chosen as a benchmark reaction. Reac-Discovery offered an improvement of ca. one order of magnitude over the state of the art. By seamlessly integrating digital design and machine learning, Reac-Discovery establishes a transformative framework for advancing complex chemical systems.

## 极性有机共晶的数据驱动发现: 机器学习和自动筛选的集成

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rr1vg?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Shan, Jiang

Polar organic cocrystals hold great promise for various advanced technological applications. However, their relatively low prevalence highlights the challenges of achieving the desired polar packing arrangements, making their discovery complex and demanding. Here, we present a data-driven approach that integrates machine learning (ML) with high-throughput (HT) automation to accelerate the discovery of polar organic cocrystals. Using ML methodologies, we identified key parameters governing polar cocrystal formation, enabling the targeted selection of molecular candidates. A total of 20 cocrystal combinations with chloranilic acid (CA) were explored, with 20 solvent systems screened for each combination, enabling a highly efficient selection process across a vast chemical space. HT automation further streamlined the synthesis and characterization processes through rapid screening and accurate structural validation, while comprehensively exploring the chemical landscape. Experimental validation yielded 16 new hydrogen-bonded cocrystals, 8 in polar space groups, achieving a polar cocrystal discovery rate (50%) over three times higher than the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) average (~14%). his integrated approach represents a new approach in polar organic cocrystal research. The findings highlight the potential of this approach for advancing functional molecular materials, paving the way for next-generation applications using polar organic cocrystals.

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-m9xgc-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Dario A., Estrin

We introduce an innovative machine learning (ML)-based framework for multiscale molecular modeling, in which the ML subsystem is treated as an electrostatic entity interacting with its molecular mechanics (MM) environment through classical electrostatics. The integration of ML accuracy with multiscale modeling is accomplished by leveraging the capabilities of the ANI neural networks to predict geometry-dependent atomic partial charges at the Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) level, going beyond static mechanical embedding. This ML/MM approach can closely approximate state-of-the-art multi-scale quantum-classical (QM/MM) methods while significantly lowering computational requirements, thereby facilitating more efficient and precise simulations in computational chemistry. The method requires no additional training beyond the initial model setup and is integrated into Amber, one of the most widely used software suites for molecular modeling, ensuring accessibility to the broader community. We validate its performance across a variety of challenging applications, including solvation structure, vibrational spectra, torsion free energy profiles, and protein-ligand interactions, achieving excellent agreement with QM/MM benchmarks. This framework not only advances the frontiers of multiscale modeling but also showcases the potential of machine learning to achieve quantum-level accuracy with exceptional efficiency for complex chemical systems.

# Predicting Fluorescence Emission Wavelengths and Quantum Yields via Machine Learning

## 通过机器学习预测荧光发射波长和量子产率

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-fhzdt-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Julio Cesar, Duarte

The search for functional fluorescent organic materials can significantly benefit from rapid and accurate predictions of photophysical properties. However, screening large numbers of potential fluorophore molecules in different solvents faces the limitations of quantum mechanical calculations and experimental measurements. In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the fluorescence of a molecule, focusing on two target properties: emission wavelengths (WLs) and quantum yields (QYs). For this purpose, we employ the Deep4Chem database containing optical properties of 20,236 combinations of 7,016 chromophores in 365 different solvents. Several chemical descriptors, or features, were selected as inputs for each model, and each molecule was characterized by its SMILES fingerprint. The Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) technique was used to rationalize the results, showing that the most impactful properties are chromophore-related, as expected from chemical intuition. For the best-performing model, the Random Forest, our results for the test set show a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 28.8 nm (0.15 eV) for WLs and 0.19 for QYs. The developed ML models were used to predict, thus completing, the missing results for the WL and QY target properties in the original Deep4Chem database, resulting in two new databases, one for each property. Testing our ML models for each target property in molecules not included in the original Deep4Chem database presented good results.

# Predict Before You Precipitate: Learning Templating Effects in HOI Antimony and Bismuth Halides

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1s2mm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Bettina V., Lotsch

Hybrid organic-inorganic (HOI) antimony and bismuth halides exhibit diverse structural features and have been studied intensely for their promising electronic and optical properties. 	There are well-explored structure-property relations for these materials. 	However, a thorough understanding of synthesis routes and templating effects is lacking, turning their targeted synthesis into an open challenge. In this study, we assemble a literature data set of established HOI material candidates and train an explainable machine learning (ML) classification model to explore the templating effects in more detail. With a classification accuracy upwards of 70%, our model is effective in predicting HOI structure types based on the reactants and points out several structural and electrostatic design features for the organic cation that influence the inorganic substructure most strongly. We further demonstrate the validity of our classifier on 9 newly synthesized members of this materials class and propose incremental learning routes to expand the model in future research.

# A Machine Learning and Quantum Chemistry Approach for Identifying Prebiotic Molecules in the Interstellar Medium

## 识别星际介质中益生元分子的机器学习和量子化学方法

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vnwq3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Hongchen, Ji

The discovery of molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) plays a key role in understanding prebiotic chemistry. Relatively few (~250)  molecules have been confirmed in the ISM, and detecting additional species is crucial for expanding our knowledge of astrochemical processes. We present a  strategy for predicting possible prebiotic molecules in the ISM that combines machine learning and  high-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations. Using a reaction dataset of over 153,000 possible combinations of known interstellar molecules, we applied a machine learning model to estimate reaction energy barriers and identify those with low or zero barriers that are most likely to occur in the ISM. From this screening process, 24 molecules were identified, five of which have already been observed in interstellar space. For the remaining 19 molecules, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) and coupled cluster theory calculations to determine the most stable conformers, spectroscopic parameters, and predict their detectability through spectroscopy. We present data to guide future observational searches for new interstellar species, contributing to the ongoing exploration of complex organic molecules in space and their potential role in prebiotic chemistry.

# Evaluation of short-term stress stability in real-time using PMU measurements and artificial intelligence : towards a self-healing smart grid

## 使用PMU测量和人工智能实时评估短期应力稳定性: 迈向自愈智能电网

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6018107/latest

This article presents a new methodology for real-time evaluation of short- term voltage stability (ETCP) using Phasor Measurement Units (PMU), intelligence techniques, artificial intelligence, and data mining. This stability assessment methodology using measurements of PMU-WAMS consists of the real-time application of an intelligent machine designed and trained offline in a three-step process. First, a database is generated with the result of dynamic simulations using Monte Carlo simulation. In the second step, it classifies the working status of the system with a systematic procedure that provides the first constraint, which quickly collapses with the estimate of the maximum Lyapunov exponent and, subsequently, the dynamic performance of the stress amplitude in the calculation of dynamic indices. In the third step, data processing is performed to extract a symbolic representation of the temporary series multi-variable, which is used to train an intelligent machine based on the algorithm random forest learning. The proposed methodology is validated in the New England system of 39 bars and the performance of the methodology to classify real-time ETCP is verified, showing that I was able to anticipate voltage stability problems, reduce temp and perform control actions such as give you advice that prevents or treats the problem.

# Potent efficacy of a NA-targeting antibody against a broad spectrum of H5N1 influenza viruses

## 针对广谱H5N1流感病毒的NA靶向抗体的有效功效

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5999144/latest

For nearly 30 years, Goose/Guangdong (Gs/Gd)-derived highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have posed significant risks to economic stability, food security, and public health. Virus evolution has resulted in various clades, including the panzootic subclade 2.3.4.4b, recognized for its pandemic potential. Here we present the potent in vitro activity of FNI9, a pan-influenza NA-inhibiting monoclonal antibody, against a range of pseudoparticles with NA spanning 27 years of Gs/Gd-derived H5N1 virus evolution. FNI9 also shows strong prophylactic protection in mice against lethal challenges with H5N1 from clade 1 and 2.3.4.4b. Cryo-EM and molecular dynamics analysis reveal that FNI9 binds to 7 highly conserved H5N1 NA residues (R118, E119, D151, E228, E278, R293, and R368). In silico evolutionary escape profiling and machine learning indicate low escapability, high fitness costs, and minimal spread likelihood for viral mutations that evade FNI9 binding. These findings support FNI9 broad protection and underscore the NA role in future influenza vaccine design.

# Gamified and Non-Gamified AI Tools in Enhancing EFL Listening Comprehension: An Analysis of Duolingo and Replika&rsquo;s Impact on Engagement, Motivation, and Learning Outcomes

## 增强EFL听力理解的游戏化和非游戏化AI工具: Duolingo和Replika对参与度，动机和学习成果的影响分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6032009/latest

Listening comprehension is a critical component of English language acquisition and a core foundation for effective communication and language development. This study investigates the impact of gamified and non-gamified AI-driven learning systems, Duolingo and Replika, on the improvement of English as a foreign language (EFL) listening comprehension. A concurrent mixed methods design was used to collect data from 53 Iranian high school students (aged 14&amp;ndash;15) residing in Tehran Province. Quantitative data were collected through researcher-developed pre- and post-intervention listening comprehension assessments and a perception questionnaire, while qualitative data were derived from classroom observation checklists and semi-structured interviews (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;15). Students were randomly allocated to two groups: Duolingo (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;27) and Replika (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;26), who participated in a 12-week intervention consisting of 24 sessions. Duolingo uses gamified elements such as rewards and points to increase engagement, while Replika uses conversation-based interactions. Quantitative analysis revealed significant improvements in listening comprehension for both groups, with the Duolingo group showing higher engagement metrics. Qualitative findings showed that Duolingo's adaptive algorithms and gamification elements fostered a more engaging and personalized learning experience. The study highlights how these AI-driven systems address previously overlooked aspects of EFL instruction through personalized, data-driven pathways, effectively improving adolescents' listening comprehension skills. The research reviewed here highlights how these systems address previously overlooked aspects of EFL instruction, particularly in improving adolescents' listening comprehension skills. By focusing on personalized, data-driven pathways, the study demonstrates how intelligent learning platforms can fill gaps in traditional teaching and effectively improve listening comprehension - a critical yet often underemphasized skill in language teaching.

# Advancing Global Eye Health:&nbsp; Progress and Insights from the Child Blindness and Low Vision Program in Northern Malawi, Southern Africa

## 推进全球眼睛健康: 南部非洲马拉维北部儿童失明和低视力项目的进展和见解

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5944251/latest

Background Blindness and low vision in children remain significant public health concerns, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Malawi, a key region in Southern Africa. These conditions are often underdiagnosed and undertreated due to limited access to specialized services, spectacles and assistive devices, posing critical challenges to health equity. The Childhood Blindness and Low Vision Program (CBLVP) in Northern Malawi aimed to address gaps through capacity building, advocacy, ensuring access to regular eye health and low vision assessments, and provision of spectacles and low vision devices.Methods Activities included setting up clinical low vision services at Mzuzu Central Hospital in Northern Malawi, followed up by conducting outreach screenings and assessments, and building capacity through training and mentorship. Advocacy efforts engaged stakeholders such as government officers, parents, teachers, and disability organizations to promote awareness and service uptake, and provide basic skills to support the use of vision by the children at school and home. A mixed-methods approach was employed to evaluate progress: quantitative data came from service records, including client statistics and device distribution, while qualitative data were collected via engagement interviews with stakeholders and beneficiaries. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were applied to identify key achievements, challenges, and areas for sustainability.Results The program established a dedicated low vision clinic serviced by a full-time optometrist/low vision therapist. Between 2022 and 2024, 2054 children were served; 370 (18%) received glasses, 70 received low vision services (3.4%), and 96 (4.9%) underwent surgery. Spectacles and low vision devices improved beneficiaries' quality of life, enabling better educational and vocational performance. Awareness campaigns, including radio interviews and social events, increased visibility and service uptake, particularly among persons with albinism. However, challenges included the lack of an admission policy for inclusive education, initially leading to unnecessary admissions to special education and unnecessary use of Braille instead of print-based learning.Conclusion The program successfully addressed service gaps, fostered sustainability, and developed a scalable model for low vision care in Malawi and Southern Africa. Future efforts should emphasize policy integration and increased public awareness to sustain and expand the impact.

# Enhancing Chemistry Learning Through The Effective Utilization Of The Periodic Table As Content And A Tool: A Mixed-Methods Study of Teachers and Learners' Engagement in Conceptual Change

## 通过有效利用元素周期表作为内容和工具来增强化学学习: 教师和学习者参与概念变革的混合方法研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6042556/latest

The periodic table is a fundamental concept in chemistry, yet its potential as both content and a tool for conceptual understanding is often underutilized. This mixed-methods study explored how teachers and learners in a South African township school engaged with the periodic table to enhance their understanding of chemical bonding and reactions. The findings indicate that teachers' perceptions of the periodic table&amp;mdash;whether as static content or a dynamic tool&amp;mdash;shaped their instructional practices and influenced learners&amp;rsquo; conceptual development. Similarly, learners who viewed the periodic table as a framework for understanding chemical properties performed better than those who saw it as mere information to memorize. The study underscores the need for professional development to enhance teachers' pedagogical strategies and improve chemistry instruction. These insights contribute to refining chemistry teaching practices and fostering meaningful conceptual change in learners.

# Measuring effectiveness of Integrating Basic Sciences with Clinical Practice through analysis of  learning outcome achievement across curriculum phases; a comparative study

## 通过分析课程各阶段的学习成果来衡量基础科学与临床实践相结合的有效性; 比较研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6025698/latest

Background: Effective integration of basic and clinical sciences is pivotal in medical education, influencing students&rsquo; ability to apply knowledge in clinical settings. This study evaluates the integration efficiency of basic sciences in differing phases of a spirally integrated curriculum through the lens of program learning outcomes (PLOs).&amp;nbsp;
Methods: &amp;nbsp;A quantitative comparative analysis was conducted across phases 1 (years 1 and 2) and 3 (year 5) of a medical curriculum. Data were collected from summative assessments, with Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) assessing knowledge and Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) assessing psychomotor skills. Achievements of course learning outcomes (CLOs) were quantified as percentages and correlated to PLOs. Statistical evaluation was performed using paired t-tests, setting significance at p &amp;lt; 0.05.&amp;nbsp;
Results: Phase 1 demonstrated successful attainment of all 12 PLOs, with achievement percentages ranging from 70-80% or higher. In contrast, phase 3 revealed lower achievement levels in specific PLOs, notably PLO 1.4. Significant disparities in mean achievements for factual knowledge PLOs (except PLO 1.2) and cognitive PLOs 2.2 and 2.3 were observed between the two phases. No significant differences were noted in psychomotor PLOs.&amp;nbsp;
Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in effectively integrating basic sciences within the clinical components of the curriculum, despite its structural advantages. These findings advocate for refined integration strategies to bolster clinical reasoning and educational efficacy, contributing substantively to discussions on enhancing medical education practices and suggesting directions for future research. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

# Deep learning for aircraft emergency landing identification: A New Moroccan Terrain Dataset Case Study

## 飞机紧急着陆识别的深度学习: 一个新的摩洛哥地形数据集案例研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6055501/latest

In the aviation industry, forced landings are undesirable occurrences that may occur to an aircraft while it is in flight. They may result from unanticipated circumstances, or engine failures. One approach that could be used to find prospective emergency landing locations for airplanes is image segmentation. Accurate segmentation should enhance aviation safety procedures generally by improving the efficient identification of safe landing zones. The accurate identification of safe landing places is crucial to aviation safety in emergency situations. Using a pixel-wise labeled dataset, this paper introduces a deep learning framework for semantic segmentation with the goal of identifying emergency landing zones in Morocco [1]. With an emphasis on terrain features like surface type, slope, and obstructions, the study assesses cutting-edge architectures such as DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, Faster R-CNN, and U-Net. To improve model generalization, a strong preparation pipeline that uses data augmentation approaches is used. Metrics like F1-score, recall, precision, and Dice coefficients show how effective the model is, and experimental findings show notable gains in segmentation accuracy. Critical gaps in the literature have prompted our investigation, especially with regard to aircraft and emergency runways, which have received relatively little attention. Since the urgent landing objective is a point rather than a piste, the majority of the work that has been published thus far is specifically for UAVs, ([2]-[7]). The results highlight the possibility of incorporating these techniques for safer emergency landings into autonomous aircraft systems. Hybrid models will be investigated in future studies, and the application will be expanded to include more varied datasets.
