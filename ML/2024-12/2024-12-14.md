# Accelerating CO₂ Direct Air Capture Screening for Metal-Organic Frameworks with a Transferable Machine Learning Force Field

## 通过可转移的机器学习力场加速金属有机框架的co ₂ 直接空气捕获筛选

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-7w6g6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Jihan, Kim

Direct air capture (DAC) of CO₂ is necessary for climate change mitigation, but it faces challenges from low atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and competition from water vapor. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are attractive candidates for DAC owing to their exceptionally high surface area, tunable porosity, and potential for adsorption-based capture processes with relatively low regeneration cost. Identifying optimal MOFs is hindered by their structural complexity, the vastness of their chemical space, and the expense of accurate simulations. Here, we present a machine learning force field (MACE-DAC) tailored for CO2 and H2O interactions in MOFs by finetuning the foundation model MACE-MP-0. To address smoothing issues and catastrophic forgetting, we curated the diverse GoldDAC dataset and introduced a continual learning loss function. To efficiently sample gas configurations, we developed the DAC-SIM package that uses MLFFs to achieve ab initio quality thermodynamics based on Widom insertion at computational speeds comparable to classical force fields. High-throughput screening on more than 8,000 synthesized MOF structures was performed to identify optimal MOFs and extract important chemical features. This approach overcomes prior limitations in describing CO2/MOF and H₂O/MOF interactions, providing a scalable and accurate framework for accelerating DAC research for porous materials.

# Advancing Vapor Pressure Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach with Directed Message Passing Neural Networks

## 推进蒸汽压预测: 一种具有定向消息传递神经网络的机器学习方法

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-nmnlk-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Shiang-Tai, Lin

Background:
Vapor pressure is a critical property in chemical and environmental engineering. Accurately predicting vapor pressure across a range of temperatures is vital for various applications, but traditional methods rely on critical property measurements or quantum mechanical calculations, which can be limiting, especially for new or under-characterized chemicals.
Methods:
This study employs a machine learning model based on the directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) architecture to predict the vapor pressure of organic molecules. Various strategies to incorporate temperature effects into the model are explored to improve prediction accuracy.
Significant findings:
The D-MPNN model achieves significantly better accuracy than the traditional PR + COSMOSAC method, with a lower average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 0.617 compared to 1.36 for the traditional method, using a dataset of 19,079 molecules. The machine learning approach offers a robust alternative that does not require additional critical property data or quantum mechanical calculations.

# Enhancing Activation Energy Predictions under Data Constraints Using Graph Neural Networks

## 使用图神经网络增强数据约束下的活化能预测

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-78w36-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Ming-Hsuan, Tsai

Accurately predicting activation energies is crucial for understanding chemical reactions and modeling complex reaction systems. However, the high computational cost of quantum chemistry methods often limits the feasibility of large-scale studies, leading to a scarcity of high-quality activation energy data. In this work, we explore and compare three innovative approaches—transfer learning, delta learning, and feature engineering—to enhance the accuracy of activation energy predictions using graph neural networks, specifically focusing on methods that incorporate low-cost, low-level computational data. Using the Chemprop model, we systematically evaluated how these methods leverage data from semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) calculations to improve predictions. Delta learning, which adjusts low-level SQM activation energies to align with high-level CCSD(T)-F12a targets, emerged as the most effective method, achieving high accuracy with substantially reduced high-level data requirements. Notably, delta learning trained with just 20%–30% of high-level data matched or exceeded the performance of other methods trained with full datasets, making it advantageous in data-scarce scenarios. However, its reliance on transition state searches imposes significant computational demands during model application. Transfer learning, which pretrains models on large datasets of low-level data, provided mixed results, particularly when there was a mismatch in the reaction distributions between the training and target datasets. Feature engineering, which involves adding computed molecular properties as input features, showed modest gains, particularly when incorporating thermodynamic properties. Our study highlights the trade-offs between accuracy and computational demand in selecting the best approach for enhancing activation energy predictions. These insights provide valuable guidelines for researchers aiming to apply machine learning in chemical reaction engineering, helping to balance accuracy with resource constraints.

# The impact of chronic intermittent hypoxia on enzymatic activity in memory-associated brain regions of male and female rats

## 慢性间歇性低氧对雄性和雌性大鼠记忆相关脑区酶活性的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5449794/latest

Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an intermittent hypoxia disorder associated with cognitive dysfunction, including learning and memory impairments. There is evidence that alterations in protease activity and neuronal activation as associated with cognitive dysfunction, are dependent on sex, and may be brain region-specific. However, the mechanisms mediating OSA-induced cognitive impairments are unclear. Therefore, we used a rat model of OSA, chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), to investigate protease activity (e.g., calpain and caspase-3) and neuronal activation (early growth response protein 1, EGR-1) in brain regions associated with learning and memory. We used a rat model of OSA known as chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) to investigate protease activity (calpain and caspase-3) and neuronal activation (early growth response protein 1, EGR-1) in brain regions associated with learning and memory.Methods Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to CIH or room air (normoxic) for 14 days. We quantified protease activity and cleaved spectrin products, along with EGR-1 protein expression in hippocampal subregions (CA1, CA3), cortical regions [entorhinal cortex (ETC), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), cerebellar cortex (CC)], and subcortical regions [raphe nucleus (RN), locus coeruleus (LC)] associated with learning and memory. Within each group, Pearson correlations of calpain activity, caspase-3 activity, and EGR-1 expression were performed between brain regions. Sex differences within normoxic and CIH correlations were examined.Results CIH dysregulated calpain activity in male ETC and female CA1 and RSC. CIH dysregulated caspase-3 activity in male RN and female CA1 and RSC. CIH decreased calpain and caspase-3 cleavage products in male ETC. CIH decreased calpain-cleaved spectrin in male RSC but increased these products in female RSC. EGR-1 expression was decreased in male and female RN. Correlational analysis revealed CIH increased excitatory connections in males and increased inhibitory connections in females. EGR-1 expression in males shifted from negative to positive correlations.Conclusions Overall, these data show that CIH dysregulates protease activity and impairs neuronal function in a brain region- and sex-dependent manner. This indicates that males and females exhibit sex-specific vulnerabilities to mild OSA. These findings concur with our previous behavioral studies that demonstrated memory impairment in CIH-exposed rats.

# A Primary User Activity Prediction for Cognitive Radio Using Machine Learning Algorithms with On-The-Go Training

## 基于机器学习算法的认知无线电主用户活动预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5448633/latest

Wireless communication is experiencing rapid growth, but it faces a significant challenge due to the limited availability of radio frequency spectrum. Cognitive Radio (CR) technology has emerged as a solution for mitigating spectrum scarcity. CR allows for more efficient spectrum utilization by enabling devices to dynamically access available frequency channels. One of the key mechanisms of CR technology is the utilization of Licensed User or Primary User (PU) channels when they are inactive. By intelligently sensing and detecting unused spectrum, CR devices can access these channels without causing interference to the primary users. Machine learning (ML) models have been successfully integrated into CR systems to improve their performance. These models are favored for their ability to accurately predict channel availability and occupancy patterns. Traditional ML approaches typically rely on labeled data and predefined decision boundaries. However, in the context of CR, the decision boundary can shift as devices transition between indoor and outdoor environments. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel model called Support Vector Machine with On-The-Go training (SVM-OTG). This model offers flexibility by allowing the CR system to train itself whenever there is a change in the environment's decision boundary. Additionally, our model undergoes On-The-Go training whenever its predictions do not match the actual output. This adaptive capability allows the CR system to continuously adapt to the changing environment, thereby improving the accuracy of its predictions. Our work has been specifically focused on enhancing spectrum usage within the widely utilized 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band. Recent studies have indicated that conventional 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi protocols often experience performance bottlenecks. To address this, we applied our SVM-OTG model to a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi dataset. Through extensive experimentation, we have demonstrated that our proposed model outperforms existing algorithms in this domain, achieving a prediction accuracy of 97.25% in both fixed and dynamic environments. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches such as LSTM, RLMLP, RNN, SHLNN, and DL-Mac, our model consistently delivers superior prediction accuracy. These results underscore the effectiveness of the SVM-OTG model in optimizing spectrum utilization and improving wireless communication in the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band.

# Integrating epigenome and sequence features for CTCF-mediated chromatin loop prediction using LightGBM

## 使用LightGBM整合表观基因组和序列特征以进行CTCF介导的染色质环预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5438447/latest

Background The three-dimensional structure of the human genome is folded to form many loops, which are involved in some critical structural chromatin proteins. The DNA binding protein ccctc-binding factor (CTCF) anchors the chromatin loop. Most anchoring loops of CTCF junctions have the same orientation verifying that CTCF&amp;rsquo;s directionality is inherited. The features that accurately distinguish long-range chromatin loops needs deeper exploration.Results Here, we present PC-Loop, a powerful machine learning framework based on LightGBM that predicts CTCF-mediated chromatin loops using PCLoop-epigenomics, PCLoop-sequences, and PCLoop-integration. Better performance in F1 score, Area under ROC curve (AUC), precision, and recall using cell lines GM12878, K562, HeLa-S3, and MSF7 demonstrated that PC-Loop outperformed Lollipop in predicting long-range chromatin loops. Thus, PC-Loop contributes to an understanding of how different proteins play roles in the formation of long-range chromatin loops and the role these proteins play in gene expression and disease control. We offer a novel approach to analyzing enhancer-promoter interactions through a comprehensive feature extraction process. By analyzing peak and signal value distributions within histone-bound protein transcription factors, we extract new biologically relevant features that capture enhancer and promoter dynamics across chromosomal domains. Unlike previous studies that focus solely on classification using machine learning models, our approach emphasizes the biological insights gained from the enhancer-promoter interactions. For example, we show how chromatin loops formed by CTCF and cohesion proteins play critical roles in gene regulation and disease treatment.Conclusions We provide a theoretical basis for improved disease risk management by uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Extracted features enable more accurate predictions and deeper biological interpretations, distinguishing our study from conventional methods.

# Predictors of Skill Trajectories in the Implementation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

## 认知行为疗法实施中技能轨迹的预测因素

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5059673/latest

Background Evidence based practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are often underutilized in community mental health settings. Implementation efforts can be effective in increasing CBT use among clinicians, but not all therapists successfully reach CBT competence at the end of training. Past studies have focused on how clinicians overall acquire CBT skills, rather than examining different learning trajectories that clinicians may follow and predictors of those trajectories; however, understanding of learning trajectories may suggest targets for implementation strategies.Methods  We used growth mixture models to identity trajectories in CBT skill acquisition among clinicians (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;812) participating in a large scale CBT training and implementation program, and examined predictors (attitudes towards EBPs, clinician burnout ,professional field, presence of a graduate degree) of trajectory membership. We assessed model fit using BIC, Vuong likelihood tests, and entropy.Results Consistent with our hypotheses, clinicians followed either a progressive trajectory with steady increases in CBT skills over time, or a stagnant trajectory with minimal increases in CBT skills. Clinicians with more positive attitudes towards EBPs were 3.51 times more likely to follow a progressive trajectory, while clinicians who selected &amp;lsquo;Other&amp;rsquo; as a professional field predicted were 0.46 times less likely to follow a progressive trajectory. Contrary to our hypotheses, presence of a graduate degree and clinician burnout did not predict CBT trajectories.Conclusion Our results indicate that attitudes towards EBPs can be an important intervention point to improve CBT skill acquisition for therapists in training and implementation efforts. More structured support for clinicians who did not receive training in mental health focused fields may also help improve CBT learning.

# YOLOv8-Based Fracture Detection System

## YOLOv8-Based断裂检测系统

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5455810/latest

Emergency departments in hospitals regularly contend with a substantial influx of patients suffering from bone fractures, with pediatric wrist trauma fractures representing a notable portion of these cases. Preceding surgical interventions, pediatric surgeons must gather information about the fracture's cause and analyze the fracture's condition through the interpretation of X-ray images. This process typically requires a blend of skills from radiologists and surgeons, involving extensive training. The rise of deep learning in the field of computer vision has highlighted the development of network models for fracture detection as a crucial area of research. This paper is centered on the utilization of the YOLOv8 algorithm to train models using the GRAZPEDWRI-DX bone fracture dataset after pre-processing with the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) method, which contains&nbsp; 6,091 pediatric patients X-ray images suffering from wrist trauma. The principal objective is to enhance the detection of fractures in these cases. The results of rigorous experimentation illuminate the merits of various YOLOv8 algorithm models, notably emphasizing the superiority of the YOLOv8m model with a 1024-pixel image size, which achieves an impressive mean average precision (mAP 50) of 0.743.&nbsp;

# Clinical Application of Deep Learning for Enhanced Multistage Caries Detection in Panoramic Radiographs

## 深度学习在全景x光片中增强多级龋齿检测的临床应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5368331/latest

The detection of dental caries is typically overlooked on panoramic radiographs. This study aims to leverage deep learning to identify multistage caries on panoramic radiographs. The panoramic radiographs were confirmed with the gold standard bitewing radiographs to create a reliable ground truth. The dataset of 500 panoramic radiographs with corresponding bitewing confirmations was labelled by an experienced and calibrated radiologist for 1,792 caries from 14,997 teeth. The annotations were stored using the annotation and image markup standard to ensure consistency and reliability. The deep learning system employed a two-model approach: YOLOv5 for tooth detection and Attention U-Net for segmenting caries. The system achieved impressive results, demonstrating almost perfect agreement with dentists for both caries counts and classifications (enamel, dentine, and pulp). However, some discrepancies exist, particularly in underestimating enamel caries. While the model occasionally overpredicts caries in healthy teeth (false positive), it prioritizes minimizing missed lesions (false negative), achieving a high recall of 0.96. Overall performance surpasses previously reported values, with an F1-score of 0.85 and an accuracy of 0.93 for caries segmentation in posterior teeth. The deep learning approach demonstrates promising potential to aid dentists in caries diagnosis, treatment planning, and dental education.

The wide adoption of interconnected services leads to the creation of supportive solutions and business opportunities. Conversely, this new paradigm is targeted by malicious activities, aiming to compromise systems' confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, advanced methods lack contextual awareness, which prevents their deployment to real-world systems. Considering that the process of making informed decisions stems from the expertise of analysts based on their experience, the use of cybersecurity domain knowledge has the potential to improve Deep Learning (DL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) operations in real scenarios. Therefore, the main goal of this research is to study and evaluate the use of Knowledge Infused Learning (KIL) in the context of automated threat defense. We define how cybersecurity domain knowledge can be infused into DL and RL, highlighting the main challenges and benefits. Besides, we present a roadmap to apply domain knowledge for red and blue teaming activities and discuss the implications of KIL in explainability, and actionable reporting. Finally, we list the open challenges to guide the development of next-generation security solutions.

# Information Systems based Working Model for the Assessment of Program Learning Outcomes in measuring the Quality in Higher Education

## 基于信息系统的工作模型，用于评估程序学习成果以衡量高等教育质量

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5265369/latest

Information Systems (IS) is an integral part of all disciplines for effective and seamless operations. This research paper shows the applications of IS based models in education and accreditation. Assessment of Program Learning Outcomes (PLO) is one of the methods to demonstrate the quality in higher education (H.E.) and key factor for successful accreditation from specific organizations. PLO is calculated by measuring the course learning outcomes (CLO) for all the modules in the program. Each CLO identifies key performance indicators (KPIs) for different assessments and measures through the students&amp;rsquo; performances. We have developed an IS based model that works on excel program to calculate the PLO automatically just by including the values of a student's score in a specific assessment. This model facilitated the teachers and quality units in the measure of PLO accurately while creating data visualizations and presenting charts for the outcomes. The application is applied in one of the business modules in the University of Gulf to show the working model in the assessment of PLO. The IS-based model for assessing Program Learning Outcomes (PLO) at the University of Gulf automated the calculation process using Excel, ensuring accurate and efficient measurement of student performance. It enhanced data visualization with charts and graphs, facilitating clear presentation and analysis. Applied to a business module, the model demonstrated practical utility and supported accreditation efforts by providing reliable PLO assessments.

# Multiclass arrhythmia classification using multimodal smartwatch photoplethysmography signals collected in real-life settings

## 使用在现实生活中收集的多模式智能手表光电容积脉搏波信号进行多类心律失常分类

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5463126/latest

In the early stages of atrial fibrillation (AF), most cases are paroxysmal (pAF), making identification only possible with continuous and prolonged monitoring. With the advent of wearables, smartwatches equipped with photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensors are an ideal approach for continuous monitoring of pAF. There have been numerous studies demonstrating successful capture of pAF events, especially using deep learning. However, deep learning requires a large amount of data and independent testing on diverse datasets, to ensure the generalizability of the model, and most prior studies did not meet these requirements. Moreover, most prior studies using wearable-based PPG sensor data collection were limited either to controlled environments, to minimize motion artifacts, or to short duration data collection. Most importantly, frequent premature atrial and ventricular contractions (PAC/PVC) can confound most AF detection algorithms. This has not been well studied, largely due to limited datasets containing these rhythms. Note that the recent deep learning models show 97% AF detection accuracy, and the sensitivity of the current state-of-the-art technique for PAC/PVC detection is only 75% on minimally motion artifact corrupted PPG data. Our study aims to address the above limitations using a recently completed NIH-funded Pulsewatch clinical trial which collected smartwatch PPG data over two weeks from 106 subjects. For our approach, we used multi-modal data which included 1D PPG, accelerometer, and heart rate data. We used a computationally efficient 1D bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (1D-Bi-GRU) deep learning model to detect three classes: normal sinus rhythm, AF, and PAC/PVC. Our proposed 1D-Bi-GRU model&amp;rsquo;s performance was compared with two other deep learning models that have reported some of the highest performance metrics, in prior work. For three-arrhythmia-classification, testing data for all deep learning models consisted of using independent data and subjects from the training data, and further evaluations were performed using two independent datasets that were not part of the training dataset. Our multimodal model achieved an unprecedented 83% sensitivity for PAC/PVC detection while maintaining a high accuracy of 97.31% for AF detection. Our model was computationally more efficient (14 times more efficient and 2.7 times faster) and outperformed the best state-of-the-art model by 20.81% for PAC/PVC sensitivity and 2.55% for AF accuracy. We also tested our models on two independent PPG datasets collected with a different smartwatch and a fingertip PPG sensor. Our three-arrhythmia-classification results show high macro-averaged area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 96.22%, and 94.17% for two independent datasets, demonstrating better generalizability of the proposed model.

# Federated Learning for Sustainable IoT Appliance Load Monitoring at the Edge Devices

## 在边缘设备上实现可持续IoT设备负载监控的联合学习

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5095675/latest

Non-intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NALM) is an essential technique that enables tracking of household appliances' electricity usage, promoting eco-friendly practices and reducing energy monitoring costs. However, NALM implementation can be challenging due to privacy concerns, particularly in real-world applications. Federated learning is a promising solution that enables load monitoring model training and sharing while ensuring data security. Nevertheless, federated learning for NALM still faces various challenges, such as limited resources, edge model personalization, and scarcity of training data. In this paper, we propose a practical federated learning framework for NALM that addresses these challenges. Our approach utilizes collaborative data aggregation over federated learning, cloud-based model compression through filter pruning, and personalized edge and multi-task learning model building with unsupervised transfer learning techniques. Our experimental results, conducted using real energy data, demonstrate that our proposed load monitoring model achieves highly accurate personalized energy disaggregation, making it a state-of-the-art approach for non-intrusive appliance load monitoring at the edge client. By using our federated learning-based load monitoring model, we can minimize energy consumption while maintaining high learning performance and preserving user privacy. Future research could focus on further development and research to improve the efficiency of federated learning implementation and address remaining challenges in real-world NALM applications.

# Low-Frequency Tremor-Like Episodes Before the 2023 MW 7.8 T&uuml;rkiye Earthquake Linked to Cement Quarrying

## 与水泥采石有关的2023兆瓦7.8 t ü rkiye地震之前的低频地震样事件

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5059839/latest

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enhanced the detection and identification of transient low-amplitude signals across the entire frequency spectrum, shedding light on deformation processes preceding natural hazards. This study investigates the low-frequency, low-amplitude signals preceding the 2023 MW 7.8 Kahramanmaraş earthquake in T&amp;uuml;rkiye. Using a deep neural network, we extract key features from the spectrograms of continuous seismic signals and employ unsupervised clustering to reveal distinct transient patterns. We identify an increased occurrence of low-frequency tremor-like signals during the six months preceding the mainshock. However, locating these signals indicates their source may be linked to anthropogenic activities at quarry sites and cement plants along the Narlı Fault, where the mainshock nucleated. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding potential patterns detected by machine-learning methodologies. Moreover, this study raises the question of whether years of mass removal and quarrying activity could have altered the stress loading along the Narlı Fault, contributing to the nucleation of the MW 7.8 earthquake.

# Neuroprotective effects of the Sodium Nitroprusside against Chronic Kidney Disease Induced-Cognitive Disorder in rats: Investigating the Involvement of Cystathionine Beta- Synthase in Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway

## 硝普钠对慢性肾脏病大鼠认知障碍的神经保护作用: 胱硫醚 β-合酶参与Nrf2/HO-1信号通路的研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5434481/latest

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a conceivable new risk factor for cognitive disorder and dementia. Uremic toxicity, oxidative stress, and peripheral-central inflammation have been considered important mediators of CKD-induced nervous disorders. Nitric oxide (NO) is a retrograde neurotransmitter in synapses, and has vital roles in intracellular signaling in neurons. This research aims to determine the effectiveness of NO in CKD-induced cognitive deficits by considering the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and the important roles of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS, H2S producing enzyme). Forty rats were divided into four experimental groups: sham, five-sixth (5/6) nephrectomy (CKD), CKD&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;NO donor (Sodium nitroprusside, SNP), CKD&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;SNP and a CBS inhibitor (amino-oxy acetic acid, AOAA). To assess the neurocognitive abilities, eleven weeks after 5/6Nx, behavioral tests (Novel object recognition test, Passive avoidance test, and Barnes maze test) were done. Twelfth week after 5/6Nx, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (sCr) levels, as well as the nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression levels and neuronal injury in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were assessed. As predicted, the levels of BUN and sCr and neuronal injury in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex increased in CKD rats as well as 5/6Nx induced reduction of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activity. Moreover, CKD leads to cognitive disorder and memory loss. SNP treatment significantly improved Nrf2/HO-1 pathways and neuronal injury as well as enhanced learning and memory ability in CKD rats. However, ameliorating effects of SNP on cognitive disorder and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway activity were nullified by CBS inhibitor and H2S reduction. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that many biological effects of NO are probably mediated by CBS activity and endogenous H2S levels.

# Computational insights into exploring the potential effects of environmental contaminants on human health

## 探索环境污染物对人类健康的潜在影响的计算见解

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5365282/latest

The rise in human activity has intensified environmental pollution, posing a global public health challenge. Understanding the intricate mechanisms by which pollutants impact health is crucial. Traditional research, often limited to specific techniques and short-term exposures, fails to capture the full complexity of these interactions. This study integrates machine-learning, quantum chemical computing, physicochemical properties, target prediction, KEGG and GO pathway analyses and survival analysis to examine the effects of air and water pollutants on human health. We chose knowledge-guided pre-trained graph transformer (KPGT) framework with an AUC of 0.83 knowledge bootstrap to predict the carcinogenic potential of pollutants and clustered environmental pollutants into seven different groups. For each group, quantum chemical and physicochemical properties, target prediction, KEGG and GO pathway analyses further revealed links between pollutants and cancer-related factors, such as MicroRNA, PD-L1, the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, and HIF-1 signaling. Survival analysis identified key proteins associated with poor cancer prognosis.

## 先进的入侵检测技术 (AIDT)，用于医疗物联网 (IoMT) 中设备之间的安全通信

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4807446/latest

Patient care and healthcare operations have been significantly improved by the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in medical applications. Understanding the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enables healthcare professionals to use remote diagnostics and real-time patient monitoring to provide treatment and save many lives. However, security and privacy have been issues since IoMT devices are vulnerable to hackers. IoMT devices don't have enough memory or processing power to set up security features. One of the primary issues with the current system is the leaking of personal and private information (IoMT). Considering the aforementioned, this study suggests an Advanced Intrusion Detection Technology (AIDT) to guarantee safe data exchange amongst IoMT devices. The model uses a probabilistic neural network (PNN) to classify whether intrusions are present or not, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature extraction.By employing the integrated patient sensing and network traffic datasets, our research achieves a superior accuracy rate of 96.4% in network intrusion detection compared to the competing algorithms. Furthermore, we incorporated a comprehensive analysis of the implementation of different classification algorithms in IoMT network intrusion detection, further supporting the claim that the proposed framework performs marginally better than alternative models.

# Generative Adversarial Networks for High Degree of Freedom Metasurface Designs

## 用于高自由度元表面设计的生成对抗网络

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5130773/latest

Due to the continuous development of microwave technology and the gradually expanding demand, attention has turned to free-form metasurfaces capable of realizing complex electromagnetic responses. Recent studies have shown that metasurface design can be accelerated and improved with the aid of deep learning methods. Here, we propose a generative adversarial network with raw network framework (RGAN) for realizing inverse design from a given response to a metasurface pattern. With the proposed approach, a metasurface design meeting requirements can be obtained immediately without the need for complex, repetitive iterative processes. Moreover, guided by the agent model within the network, the network is able to maximize exploration of the parameter space, ultimately generating novel designs completely distinct from those in the training set. Simulations demonstrate good spectral response matching. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified through experiments. The RGAN-based inverse prediction framework shows potential in the field of metasurface engineering and can be easily extended to other metasurface application areas, such as optical metamaterials and nanophotonic devices.

# FairPlay: Improving Medical Machine Learning Models with Generative Balancing for Equity and Excellence

## FairPlay: 通过生成性平衡来改善医疗机器学习模型，以实现公平和卓越

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5252769/latest

Understanding and addressing the innate complexities of applying machine learning to clinical outcome prediction requires a deep knowledge of the unique challenges inherent in this field. These challenges are particularly pronounced due to imbalanced datasets and the sensitive nature of tasks, especially in scenarios where critical outcomes are rare and ensuring equitable treatment across diverse patient groups is paramount. Despite attempts to improve these models and to bridge the divide in performance between different gender, racial, and ethnic groups, the disparity in representation, exacerbated by the overall scarcity of positive labels, contributes to biased predictions and decisions, further perpetuating health disparities.&amp;nbsp;
This paper proposes a powerful approach using synthetic patient data, FairPlay, offering a dual solution: enhancing overall algorithmic performance while mitigating bias by bolstering un-derrepresented populations. By generating realistic, anonymous synthetic data echoing real patient characteristics through an advanced , large language model-based approach, we not only improve representation without compromising privacy but also improve the general performance of algorithms by exposing them to a richer variety of patient profiles.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a variety of experiments on multiple datasets. We showcase that FairPlay can improve the performance of mortality prediction both overall and across multiple different groups. Specifically, we find that FairPlay can improve F1 Score averaged across a suite of downstream models by up to 21% without accessing any additional data or changing any of the downstream model training regimens. It achieves this across every subgroup while simultaneously shrinking the gap between different subgroup performances, as demonstrated through the universal improvement of a pair of fairness metrics across four different experimental setups.

# YOLOv8-GK: Tomato leaf disease detection algorithm

## YOLOv8-GK: 番茄叶部病害检测算法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5454516/latest

Tomato leaf diseases seriously affect the yield and quality of tomatoes, so it is crucial to detect leaf diseases accurately. In recent years, the use of deep learning techniques has significantly improved the accuracy of plant leaf disease detection. However, the existing deep learning detection models perform poorly when confronted with the mutual occlusion between leaves, the change of light, and interference from complex backgrounds such as plants and soil. To overcome the challenge of accurately locating and classifying tomato leaf diseases in complex scenarios, this paper proposes a real-time leaf disease detection method based on YOLOv8. On the one hand, to address the defect of capturing global contextual information and the problem of gradient vanishing in deep networks, a GIP-SPPF module is constructed by integrating global background information and edge information. This module preserves the edge cross information, effectively reducing the training difficulty while improving the model performance. On the other hand, to effectively reduce the size of model parameters, we introduced a depthwise separable convolutional structure and combined it with the idea of a residual connection mechanism to construct KOIDSConv, which not only significantly improves the lightweight of the model, but also enhances feature fusion and information complementarity between different channels. The results show that the YOLOv8-GK model has better detection performance than other detection methods in the dataset constructed in this paper, with a high mAP of 98.06%.&nbsp;

# RUL Prediction of Continuous Casting Machine Based on Deep Transfer Learning

## 基于深度迁移学习的连铸机RUL预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5278915/latest

The operation and maintenance of continuous casting machines involve continuous casting rolls with varying degrees of newness, age, and maintenance history. This variability poses challenges in gathering adequate fault failure data for all continuous casting rolls, resulting in limited effectiveness of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction methods based on deep learning. This limitation arises from the insufficient availability of fault labeling data. To tackle this issue, we first construct a CNN-BiLSTM model for predicting the RUL of continuous casting rolls, utilizing available fault failure data. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of transfer learning, where the source domain consists of the old continuous casting roll dataset with ample fault failure data, while the target domain comprises the new continuous casting roll dataset with limited fault failure data. The network structure and parameters of the model are adjusted through the reciprocal exchange of data between the source domain and the target domain. This leads to the development of the TL-CNN-BiLSTM RUL prediction model, which combines transfer learning and deep learning. The efficacy of this model in predicting the RUL of continuous casting rolls with varying levels of fault failure data accumulation is subsequently demonstrated through illustrative examples.

# A Deep Learning Approach for Healthcare Insurance Fraud Detection

## 一种用于医疗保险欺诈检测的深度学习方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5453482/latest

Healthcare fraud is a global financial challenge affecting economic stability and trust in services, with traditional machine learning models struggling to accurately capture its complexity and adaptive nature. This study investigates the application of three deep learning (DL) models, which are artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTM) for healthcare fraud detection. This study used healthcare claim data, including patient demographics, claim amounts, diagnostic codes, and procedure types, to analyse healthcare service usage and identify fraudulent activity. To enhance the interpretability of these models, locally interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) were used. The evaluation results demonstrated that the ANN was the best performer with an accuracy of 0.94, precision of 0.78, recall of 0.45, and F1-score of 0.57. While CNN excelled in accuracy, the LSTM was more effective in reducing false negatives. The LIME for ANN shows the prediction of a claim to be non-fraudulent with a high probability of 0.96, as opposed to a 0.03 probability of being fraudulent with &amp;lsquo;PotentialFraud', as a driving feature, the evaluation metrics show that it is good at correctly identifying fraudulent cases. This study highlights the efficacy of integrating deep learning models with explainable AI (XAI), contributing to the growing research body in healthcare insurance fraud detection.

# Research on image steganography based on conditional Invertible Neural Network

## 基于条件可逆神经网络的图像隐写研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5209220/latest

To improve the security of image steganography, an image steganography method based on conditional Invertible Neural Network is proposed in this paper. First, we design a conditional Invertible Neural Network to obtain high-quality stego images with rich high-level semantic information and clear spatial details. Based on the conditional directivity of conditional Invertible Neural Network, we can accurately adjust the semantic information of stego image and ensure the controllability of stego image content. We introduce a dual cross-attention module into the network structure. The integration of dual cross-attention modules enhances feature extraction and captures complex image details to improve steganographic accuracy. In addition, the introduction of the convolutional block attention module in the convolutional layer direct the model's focus to key image regions, refining stego image quality. We increase the number of convolutional blocks, which improves the efficiency of feature extraction and reuse. A large number of experiments are carried out on the datasets. For cover and stego image pairs, the PSNR value reached 43.62dB, and for secret and recovery image pairs, the PSNR value reached 46.48dB. Experimental results show that the image quality and security of this method are better than other state-of-the-art image steganography methods.

# A novel feature extractor based on Constrained Cross Network for Detecting Sleep State

## 一种基于约束交叉网络的睡眠状态检测特征提取器

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5365048/latest

With increasing awareness of healthy living and social pressure, more and more people have begun to pay attention to their&nbsp;sleep state. Therefore, detecting sleep state is important for personal physical and mental health. Usually, when we talk about&nbsp;sleep detection, the main data source is polysomnography (PSG). Sleep detection based on wrist-worn device data is an&nbsp;excellent alternative to PSG data. However, the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to wrist-worn&nbsp;device data is still in its early stages. Most existing methods that utilize this type of data for detection rely on heuristic algorithms&nbsp;or traditional machine learning, which suffer from low classification efficiency and insufficient accuracy. To further increase&nbsp;the accuracy, this paper improves the weight matrix of Cross Network in Improved Deep&amp;Cross Network and adds it to the&nbsp;traditional feature extractor. First, we verify the theoretical validity of this method. Then, in the experimental phase, the&nbsp;effectiveness of different feature sets and parameter scales of the feature extractor is carried out. The experimental results&nbsp;show that the accuracy increases from 90.0% to 95.7% when using fully connected layers as the classifier. The ablation&nbsp;experiment shows that at a baseline of 90.00%, the accuracy of the feature derivation module has increased by 3.72%, and&nbsp;the accuracy of the feature crossover module has increased by 2.90%. Using the Constrained Cross Network, the average&nbsp;accuracy increases from 4.45% to 5.67%, which can accurately detect sleep state and then be used to evaluate sleep quality.

# Enhanced Classification of Tinnitus Patients Using EEG Microstates and Deep Learning Techniques

## 使用EEG微状态和深度学习技术对耳鸣患者进行增强分类

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5373220/latest

Objective:
This study aims to deepen the understanding and classification of tinnitus through a comprehensive analysis of EEG signals utilizing innovative microstate analysis techniques and cutting-edge machine learning approaches.
Methods:
EEG data were meticulously collected from 16 healthy individuals and 20 tinnitus patients, segmented into five frequency sub-bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) and categorized into four distinct microstate configurations (4-state, 5-state, 6-state, 7-state). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed to analyze microstate duration, occurrence, coverage, global field power (GFP), and transition probabilities. A diverse array of classifiers was utilized, including traditional models (SVM, DT, RF), deep learning models (DNN, CNN), and pre-trained architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, Xception). Notably, a novel feature-to-image transformation method was integrated to enhance the interpretability of the microstate data.
Results:
The DNN classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 97.49% in the beta sub-band, employing a 5-state configuration alongside GFP_TC features. Tinnitus patients demonstrated increased activation in the alpha frequency band and exhibited more dispersed microstate distributions, indicating significant alterations in neural dynamics. Additionally, a detailed numerical analysis of transition matrices revealed reduced self-transition probabilities and heightened transitions between states in tinnitus patients, exemplified by a drop from 0.88 to 0.72 in the Delta band for state A. Furthermore, the SVM classifier, when paired with ResNet50 and Xception, reached perfect performance metrics, achieving accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC all equal to 1 across all microstates.
Conclusion:
The findings suggest that microstate analysis, when integrated with advanced machine learning methodologies, serves as a powerful tool for enhancing the diagnosis and comprehension of tinnitus. The high classification accuracies, coupled with detailed microstate assessments, reveal significant neural dynamics differences between tinnitus patients and healthy controls, offering promising implications for clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies.

# CurrI2P: Inter- and Intra-Modality Similarity Curriculum Learning for Image-to-Point Cloud Registration

## CurrI2P: 用于图像到点云配准的模态间和模态内相似性课程学习

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5457151/latest

Image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration aims to align 2D images and 3D point clouds within the same scene. However, existing methods neglect the differences in learning difficulties among different samples, failing to bridge the image-to-point cloud modality gap adequately. Moreover, the features of images or point clouds within the same modality are easily affected by various geometric transformations, which further increases the complexity of the registration task. To address these issues, we propose a similarity curriculum learning framework for I2P registration, termed CurrI2P, which not only effectively captures similarities between different data pairs but also gradually adapts the model to more complex data transformations. Specifically, we first present inter-modality similarity curriculum learning to progressively enhance cross-modality similarity to reduce inaccurate matches caused by coarse registration at the early training stage. In addition, we design intra-modality similarity curriculum learning, particularly targeting to learn invariant features of images or point clouds within the same modality under the geometric disturbance of increasing magnitude. In experiments, we incorporate CurrI2P into different baselines to validate the feasibility and achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on both KITTI and nuScenes datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/lin-liwei/CurrI2P.

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5632243/latest

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of various machine-learning models for energy forecasting across different seasons in students' residential settings. Our research investigates the performance of baseline models, including LSTM, GRU, state-of-the-art forecasting models, including Autoregressive feedforward neural network, Transformer, and hybrid approaches, by evaluating their ability to predict energy usage with high accuracy. Seasonal patterns and the occurrence of anomalous events such as vacations, meteorological shifts, unpredictable nature of human activity leading to sudden spikes and drops in energy consumption are particular challenges. The results demonstrate that no single model uniformly outperforms others across all seasons, which shows the necessity for season-specific model selection or design. Our proposed HyperNetLSTM and MiniAutoEncXGBoost models are delivering robustness in learning to seasonal variations especially in capturing sudden changes in consumption during the summer. The research contributes to the field of energy forecasting by the significance of seasonal insight and model behavior.

# Lactate-Related Gene Signatures as Prognostic Predictors and Comprehensive Analysis of Immune Profiles in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma

## 乳酸相关基因标记作为鼻咽癌预后预测因子和免疫谱的综合分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5405893/latest

Objectives Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an aggressive malignancy with high rates of morbidity and mortality, largely because of its late diagnosis and metastatic potential. Lactate metabolism and protein lactylation are thought to play roles in NPC pathogenesis by modulating the tumor microenvironment and immune evasion. However, research specifically linking lactate-related mechanisms to NPC remains limited. This study aimed to identify lactate-associated biomarkers in NPC and explore their underlying mechanisms, with a particular focus on immune modulation and tumor progression.Methods To achieve these objectives, we utilized a bioinformatics approach in which publicly available gene expression datasets related to NPC were analysed. Differential expression analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between NPC and normal tissues. We performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify module genes significantly associated with NPC. Overlaps among DEGs, key module genes, and lactate-related genes (LRGs) were analysed to derive lactate-related differentially expressed genes (LR-DEGs). Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict potential biomarkers, and immune infiltration analysis can be used to examine the relationships between identified biomarkers and immune cell types, particularly M0 macrophages and B cells.Results A total of 1,058 DEGs were identified between the NPC and normal tissue groups. From this set, 372 key module genes associated with NPC were isolated. By intersecting the DEGs, key module genes, and lactate-related genes (LRGs), 17 lactate-related DEGs (LR-DEGs) were identified. Using three machine learning algorithms, this list was further refined, resulting in three primary lactate-related biomarkers: TPPP3, MUC4, and CLIC6. These biomarkers were significantly enriched in pathways related to "immune cell activation" and the "extracellular matrix environment." Additionally, M0 and B macrophages were found to be closely associated with these biomarkers, suggesting their involvement in shaping the NPC immune microenvironment.Conclusion In summary, this study identified TPPP3, MUC4, and CLIC6 as lactate-associated clinical modelling indicators linked to NPC. linked to NPC, providing a foundation for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this malignancy.

# Knowledge Fusion Guided Pre-training Non-intrusive Load Sparse Sample Recognition

## 知识融合引导的预训练非侵入式负荷稀疏样本识别

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5458181/latest

The deep learning technology can realize the rapid recognition of the non-intrusive load, but this technology relies on huge amount of the offline labeled sample for the model training, which increases the cost of the modeling. Due to the randomness of the daily electricity consumption in the users and the sparsity of the unknown load sampled data, the new unknown load sample models exist the low accuracy and the poor reliability. These problems seriously affects the promotion and application of the non-intrusive load identification (NILI) in the electric power industry. In the paper, we present a sparse sample recognition framework, namely KFG-DBiLSTM, to enhances the fusion feature representation ability while improves the knowledge transfer reliability. KFG-DBiLSTM uses the Ad-HW algorithm to detecting and denoising of the raw load data for improving the data availability. To learn more key features information and to enhance the representation interpretability, we propose a dual-layer Transformer network, which improve the fusion features extraction ability in the pre-training stage. By fusion the load knowledge features to train a DBiLSTM network as the load type recognizer for reducing the error rate of the model recognition effectively, which overcomes the bidirectional dependence of the load time series sampled data. To ensure the reliability of the model parameters fine-tuning and transfer, we present a weighted cosine similarity (WCS) measurement method, WCS can eliminate the difference of the load feature fusion and parameters transfer in the fine-tuning stage. A large number of the experiments on the REDD, UK-DALE, and RDSA datasets reveal that our method has a higher unknown load identification accuracy and the good stability. In the case of meeting certain accuracy, a small sample set is used to complete the fine-grained load identification, and this method has strong technical applicability in the smart grid.

# A holistic data-driven approach to synthesis predictions of colloidal nanocrystal shapes

## 一种用于胶体纳米晶体形状合成预测的整体数据驱动方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5397033/latest

The ability to precisely design colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) has far-reaching implications in optoelectronics, catalysis, biomedicine, and beyond. Achieving such control is generally based on a trials-and-errors approach. Data-driven synthesis holds the promise to advance both discovery and mechanistic knowledge. Herein, we contribute to advancing the current state of the art in the chemical synthesis of colloidal NCs by proposing a machine-learning toolbox which operates in a low data regime, yet comprehensive of the most typical parameters relevant for colloidal NC synthesis. The developed toolbox predicts the NC shape given the reaction conditions and proposes reaction conditions given a target NC shape, using Cu NCs as the model system. By classifying NC shapes on a continuous energy scale, we synthesize an unreported shape, which are Cu rhombic dodecahedra. This holistic approach integrates data-driven and computational tools with materials chemistry. Such development is promising to greatly accelerate materials discovery and mechanistic understanding, thus advancing the field of tailored materials with atomic scale precision tunability.
