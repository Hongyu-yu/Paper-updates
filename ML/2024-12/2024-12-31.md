Super-resolution (SR) technology plays a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of images. SR reconstruction aims to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. Traditional methods often result in blurred or distorted images. Advanced techniques such as sparse representation and deep learning-based methods have shown promising results but still face limitations in terms of noise robustness and computational complexity.

# Machine learning-based compression of quantum many body physics: PCA and autoencoder representation of the vertex function

**Authors:** Jiawei Zang, Matija Medvidović, Dominik Kiese, Domenico Di Sante, Anirvan M Sengupta and Andrew J Millis

Theoretical approaches to quantum many-body physics require developing compact representations of the complexity of generic quantum states. This paper explores an interpretable data-driven approach utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoder neural networks to compress the two-particle vertex, a key element in Feynman diagram approaches. We show that the linear PCA offers more physical insight and better out-of-distribution generalization than the nominally more expressive autoencoders. Even with ∼10–20 principal components, we find excellent reconstruction across the phase diagram suggesting the existence of heretofore unrealized structures in the diagrammatic theory. We show that the principal components needed to describe the ferromagnetic state are not contained in the low rank description of the Fermi liquid (FL) state, unlike those for antiferromagnetic and superconducting states, suggesting that the latter two states emerge from pre-existing fluctuations in the FL while ferromagnetism is driven by a different process.

# QR-DeepONet: resolve abnormal convergence issue in deep operator network

## Qr-deeponet: 解决深度运营商网络中的异常收敛问题

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ada0a5

**Authors:** Jie Zhao, Biwei Xie and Xingquan Li

Deep operator network (DeepONet) has been proven to be highly successful in operator learning tasks. Theoretical analysis indicates that the generation error of DeepONet should decrease as the basis dimension increases, thus providing a systematic way to reduce its generalization errors (GEs) by varying the network hyperparameters. However, in practice, we found that, depending on the problem being solved and the activation function used, the GEs fluctuate unpredictably, contrary to theoretical expectations. Upon analyzing the output matrix of the trunk net, we determined that this behavior stems from the learned basis functions being highly linearly dependent, which limits the expressivity of the vanilla DeepONet. To address these limitations, we propose QR decomposition enhanced DeepONet (QR-DeepONet), an enhanced version of DeepONet using QR decomposition. These modifications ensured that the learned basis functions were linearly independent and orthogonal to each other. The numerical results demonstrate that the GEs of QR-DeepONet follow theoretical predictions that decrease monotonically as the basis dimension increases and outperform vanilla DeepONet. Consequently, the proposed method successfully fills the gap between the theory and practice.

Abstract: We present an algorithm for accelerating the search of molecule's adsorption site based on global optimization of surface adsorbate geometries. Our approach uses a machine-learning interatomic potential (moment tensor potential) to approximate the potential energy surface and an active learning algorithm for the automatic construction of an optimal training dataset. To validate our methodology, we compare the results across various well-known catalytic systems with surfaces of different crystallographic orientations and adsorbate geometries, including CO/Pd(111), NO/Pd(100), NH$_3$/Cu(100), C$_6$H$_6$/Ag(111), and CH$_2$CO/Rh(211). In the all cases, we observed an agreement of our results with the literature.

# Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics

## 用基础模型和静电识别分裂的空缺

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19330

**Authors:** Se\'an R. Kavanagh

arXiv:2412.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.

arXiv:2412.19333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In moir\'e systems, the impact of lattice relaxation on electronic band structures is significant, yet the computational demands of first-principles relaxation are prohibitively high due to the large number of atoms involved. To address this challenge, We introduce a robust methodology for the construction of machine learning potentials specifically tailored for moir\'e structures and present an open-source software package DPmoire designed to facilitate this process. Utilizing this package, we have developed machine learning force fields (MLFFs) for MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) materials. Our approach not only streamlines the computational process but also ensures accurate replication of the detailed electronic and structural properties typically observed in density functional theory (DFT) relaxations. The MLFFs were rigorously validated against standard DFT results, confirming their efficacy in capturing the complex interplay of atomic interactions within these layered materials. This development not only enhances our ability to explore the physical properties of moir\'e systems with reduced computational overhead but also opens new avenues for the study of relaxation effects and their impact on material properties in two-dimensional layered structures.

arXiv:2412.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molten salts are crucial for clean energy applications, yet exploring their thermophysical properties across diverse chemical space remains challenging. We present the development of a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) called SuperSalt, which targets 11-cation chloride melts and captures the essential physics of molten salts with near-DFT accuracy. Using an efficient workflow that integrates systems of one, two, and 11 components, the SuperSalt potential can accurately predict thermophysical properties such as density, bulk modulus, thermal expansion, and heat capacity. Our model is validated across a broad chemical space, demonstrating excellent transferability. We further illustrate how Bayesian optimization combined with SuperSalt can accelerate the discovery of optimal salt compositions with desired properties. This work provides a foundation for future studies that allows easy extensions to more complex systems, such as those containing additional elements. SuperSalt represents a shift towards a more universal, efficient, and accurate modeling of molten salts for advanced energy applications.

**Authors:** Marcel Guzman, Felipe Martins, Menachem Stern, Andrea J. Liu

arXiv:2412.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In physical networks trained using supervised learning, physical parameters are adjusted to produce desired responses to inputs. An example is electrical contrastive local learning networks of nodes connected by edges that are resistors that adjust their conductances during training. When an edge conductance changes, it upsets the current balance of every node. In response, physics adjusts the node voltages to minimize the dissipated power. Learning in these systems is therefore a coupled double-optimization process, in which the network descends both a cost landscape in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, and a physical landscape -- the power -- in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. Because of this coupling, the physical landscape of a trained network contains information about the learned task. Here we demonstrate that all the physical information relevant to the trained input-output relation can be captured by a susceptibility, an experimentally measurable quantity. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations to show that the susceptibility is positively correlated with functional importance and that we can extract physical insight into how the system performs the task from the conductances of highly susceptible edges.

arXiv:2412.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial imaging of magnetic stray fields from magnetic materials is a useful tool for identifying the underlying magnetic configurations of the material. However, transforming the magnetic image into a magnetization image is an ill-poised problem, which can result in artefacts that limit the inferences that can be made on the material under investigation. In this work, we develop a neural network fitting approach that approximates this transformation, reducing these artefacts. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach allows the inclusion of additional models and bounds that are not possible with traditional reconstruction methods. These advantages allow for the reconstruction of non-trivial magnetization textures with varying magnetization directions in thin-film magnets, which was not possible previously. We demonstrate this new capability by performing magnetization reconstructions on a variety of topological spin textures.

Abstract: Simulating atomic-scale processes, such as protein dynamics and catalytic reactions, is crucial for advancements in biology, chemistry, and materials science. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as powerful tools that achieve near quantum mechanical accuracy, with promising generalization capabilities. However, their practical use is often limited by long inference times compared to classical force fields, especially when running extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations required for many biological applications. In this study, we introduce BoostMD, a surrogate model architecture designed to accelerate MD simulations. BoostMD leverages node features computed at previous time steps to predict energies and forces based on positional changes. This approach reduces the complexity of the learning task, allowing BoostMD to be both smaller and significantly faster than conventional MLFFs. During simulations, the computationally intensive reference MLFF is evaluated only every $N$ steps, while the lightweight BoostMD model handles the intermediate steps at a fraction of the computational cost. Our experiments demonstrate that BoostMD achieves an eight-fold speedup compared to the reference model and generalizes to unseen dipeptides. Furthermore, we find that BoostMD accurately samples the ground-truth Boltzmann distribution when running molecular dynamics. By combining efficient feature reuse with a streamlined architecture, BoostMD offers a robust solution for conducting large-scale, long-timescale molecular simulations, making high-accuracy ML-driven modeling more accessible and practical.

arXiv:2412.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently estimating large numbers of non-commuting observables is an important subroutine of many quantum science tasks. We present the derandomized shallow shadows (DSS) algorithm for efficiently learning a large set of non-commuting observables, using shallow circuits to rotate into measurement bases. Exploiting tensor network techniques to ensure polynomial scaling of classical resources, our algorithm outputs a set of shallow measurement circuits that approximately minimizes the sample complexity of estimating a given set of Pauli strings. We numerically demonstrate systematic improvement, in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, for energy estimation of quantum chemistry benchmarks and verification of quantum many-body systems, and we observe DSS's performance consistently improves as one allows deeper measurement circuits. These results indicate that in addition to being an efficient, low-depth, stand-alone algorithm, DSS can also benefit many larger quantum algorithms requiring estimation of multiple non-commuting observables.

# Deep ReLU networks -- injectivity capacity upper bounds

## 深度ReLU网络 -- 内射容量上限

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19677

**Authors:** Mihailo Stojnic

arXiv:2412.19677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study deep ReLU feed forward neural networks (NN) and their injectivity abilities. The main focus is on \emph{precisely} determining the so-called injectivity capacity. For any given hidden layers architecture, it is defined as the minimal ratio between number of network's outputs and inputs which ensures unique recoverability of the input from a realizable output. A strong recent progress in precisely studying single ReLU layer injectivity properties is here moved to a deep network level. In particular, we develop a program that connects deep $l$-layer net injectivity to an $l$-extension of the $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons, thereby massively generalizing an isomorphism between studying single layer injectivity and the capacity of the so-called (1-extension) $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons discussed in [82]. \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based machinery is then created and utilized to statistically handle properties of the extended $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons and implicitly of the deep ReLU NNs. A sizeable set of numerical evaluations is conducted as well to put the entire RDT machinery in practical use. From these we observe a rapidly decreasing tendency in needed layers' expansions, i.e., we observe a rapid \emph{expansion saturation effect}. Only $4$ layers of depth are sufficient to closely approach level of no needed expansion -- a result that fairly closely resembles observations made in practical experiments and that has so far remained completely untouchable by any of the existing mathematical methodologies.

Abstract: Since the dawn of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), tapping or intermittent contact mode has been one of the most widely used imaging modes. Manual optimization of tapping mode not only takes a lot of instrument and operator time, but also often leads to frequent probe and sample damage, poor image quality and reproducibility issues for new types of samples or inexperienced users. Despite wide use, optimization of tapping mode imaging is an extremely hard problem, ill-suited to either classical control methods or machine learning. Here we introduce a reward-driven workflow to automate the optimization of SPM in the tapping mode. The reward function is defined based on multiple channels with physical and empirical knowledge of good scans encoded, representing a sample-agnostic measure of image quality and imitating the decision-making logic employed by human operators. This automated workflow gives optimal scanning parameters for different probes and samples and gives high-quality SPM images consistently in the attractive mode. This study broadens the application and accessibility of SPM and opens the door for fully automated SPM.

Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.

Abstract: The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive performance in the text generation task, showing the ability to understand and respond to complex instructions. However, the performance of naive LLMs in speciffc domains is limited due to the scarcity of domain-speciffc corpora and specialized training. Moreover, training a specialized large-scale model necessitates signiffcant hardware resources, which restricts researchers from leveraging such models to drive advances. Hence, it is crucial to further improve and optimize LLMs to meet speciffc domain demands and enhance their scalability. Based on the condensed matter data center, we establish a material knowledge graph (MaterialsKG) and integrate it with literature. Using large language models and prompt learning, we develop a specialized dialogue system for topological materials called TopoChat. Compared to naive LLMs, TopoChat exhibits superior performance in structural and property querying, material recommendation, and complex relational reasoning. This system enables efffcient and precise retrieval of information and facilitates knowledge interaction, thereby encouraging the advancement on the ffeld of condensed matter materials.

Abstract: Discriminating the low-abundance hydroxylated proline from hydroxylated proline is crucial for monitoring diseases and eval-uating therapeutic outcomes that require single-molecule sensors. While the plasmonic nanopore sensor can detect the hydrox-ylation with single-molecule sensitivity by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), it suffers from intrinsic fluctuations of single-molecule signals as well as strong interference from citrates. Here, we used the occurrence frequency histogram of the single-molecule SERS peaks to extract overall dataset spectral features, overcome the signal fluctuations and investigate the citrate-replaced plasmonic nanopore sensors for clean and distinguishable signals of proline and hydroxylated proline. By ligand exchange of the citrates by analyte molecules, the representative peaks of citrates decreased with incubation time, prov-ing occupation of the plasmonic hot spot by the analytes. As a result, the discrimination of the single-molecule SERS signals of proline and hydroxylated proline was possible with the convolutional neural network model with 96.6% accuracy.

Abstract: Photonic computation started to shape the future of fast, efficient and accessible computation. The advantages brought by light based Diffractive Deep Neural Networks (D2NN), are shown to be overwhelmingly advantageous especially in targeting classification problems. However, cost and complexity of multi-layer systems are the main challenges that reduce the deployment of this technology. In this study, we develop a simple yet extremely efficient way to achieve optical classification using a single diffractive optical layer. A spatial light modulator is used not only to emulate the classifying system but also the input medium for the objects to be classified by the system. Using our approach, we classify road traffic signs which has a direct application on daily life and safety. We perform classification of road signs under the effect of noise and show that we can successfully classify road signs with more than 75% accuracy under 20% noise/imperfection.

Abstract: Accurate measurements of cosmic ray proton flux are crucial for studying the modulation processes of cosmic rays during the solar activity cycle. We present a proton flux measurement method based on ground-based neutron monitor (NM) data and machine learning techniques. After preprocessing the NM data, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to simulate the relationship between the NM observations and proton flux measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02). We obtain daily proton flux data ranging from 1GV to 100GV for the period from 2011 to 2024, showing that the measured values are in good agreement with the observed ones. In particular, we provide daily proton flux measurements for periods when AMS-02 data are unavailable due to operational reasons. We also perform wavelet analyses on the continuous proton flux data to investigate the relationship between proton flux and solar activity variations, particularly during late 2014 when AMS-02 measurements were missing.

Abstract: We present an algorithm for accelerating the search of molecule's adsorption site based on global optimization of surface adsorbate geometries. Our approach uses a machine-learning interatomic potential (moment tensor potential) to approximate the potential energy surface and an active learning algorithm for the automatic construction of an optimal training dataset. To validate our methodology, we compare the results across various well-known catalytic systems with surfaces of different crystallographic orientations and adsorbate geometries, including CO/Pd(111), NO/Pd(100), NH$_3$/Cu(100), C$_6$H$_6$/Ag(111), and CH$_2$CO/Rh(211). In the all cases, we observed an agreement of our results with the literature.

# Accelerating Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds Parameter Estimation in Pulsar Timing Arrays with Flow Matching

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are essential tools for detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), but their analysis faces significant computational challenges. Traditional methods like Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) struggle with high-dimensional parameter spaces where noise parameters often dominate, while existing deep learning approaches fail to model the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation or are validated only on synthetic datasets. We propose a flow-matching-based continuous normalizing flow (CNF) for efficient and accurate PTA parameter estimation. By focusing on the 10 most contributive pulsars from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, our method achieves posteriors consistent with MCMC, with a Jensen-Shannon divergence below \(10^{-2}\) nat, while reducing sampling time from 50 hours to 4 minutes. Powered by a versatile embedding network and a reweighting loss function, our approach prioritizes the SGWB parameters and scales effectively for future datasets. It enables precise reconstruction of SGWB and opens new avenues for exploring vast observational data and uncovering potential new physics, offering a transformative tool for advancing gravitational wave astronomy.

# Are Two Hidden Layers Still Enough for the Physics-Informed Neural Networks?

Abstract: The article discusses the development of various methods and techniques for initializing and training neural networks with a single hidden layer, as well as training a separable physics-informed neural network consisting of neural networks with a single hidden layer to solve physical problems described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). A method for strictly deterministic initialization of a neural network with one hidden layer for solving physical problems described by an ODE is proposed. Modifications to existing methods for weighting the loss function are given, as well as new methods developed for training strictly deterministic-initialized neural networks to solve ODEs (detaching, additional weighting based on the second derivative, predicted solution-based weighting, relative residuals). An algorithm for physics-informed data-driven initialization of a neural network with one hidden layer is proposed. A neural network with pronounced generalizing properties is presented, whose generalizing abilities of which can be precisely controlled by adjusting network parameters. A metric for measuring the generalization of such neural network has been introduced. A gradient-free neuron-by-neuron fitting method has been developed for adjusting the parameters of a single-hidden-layer neural network, which does not require the use of an optimizer or solver for its implementation. The proposed methods have been extended to 2D problems using the separable physics-informed neural networks approach. Numerous experiments have been carried out to develop the above methods and approaches. Experiments on physical problems, such as solving various ODEs and PDEs, have demonstrated that these methods for initializing and training neural networks with one or two hidden layers (SPINN) achieve competitive accuracy and, in some cases, state-of-the-art results.

# Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics

**Authors:** Se\'an R. Kavanagh

Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.

Abstract: Seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) has seen promising advancements through deep learning. Existing approaches typically focus on task-specific models trained and evaluated in isolation that lead to limited generalization across different geological scenarios. In this work we introduce a task-agnostic foundational model for FWI that captures general features across tasks. We first demonstrate that full fine-tuning of this foundational model outperforms task-specific models built from scratch by delivering superior performance across multiple benchmarks. Building upon this we employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to further reduce computational overhead. By fine-tuning only a small fraction of the model parameters PEFT achieves comparable results to full fine-tuning while significantly lowering memory and computational requirements. Additionally, PEFT excels in out-of-distribution tasks where it outperforms both full fine-tuning and task-specific models. These findings establish the value of foundational modeling for FWI and highlight PEFT as an effective strategy for efficient and scalable adaptation across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a side effect of thoracic radiation therapy. Recently, Machine learning (ML) models enhanced with radiomic and dosiomic features provide better predictions by incorporating spatial information beyond DVHs. However, to improve the clinical decision process, we propose to use uncertainty quantification (UQ) to improve the confidence in model prediction. This study evaluates the impact of post hoc UQ methods on the discriminative performance and calibration of ML models for RP prediction. Methods: This study evaluated four ML models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and random forest (RF), using radiomic, dosiomic, and dosimetric features to predict RP. We applied UQ methods, including Patt scaling, isotonic regression, Venn-ABERS predictor, and Conformal Prediction, to quantify uncertainty. Model performance was assessed through Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), and Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV). Results: UQ methods enhanced predictive performance, particularly for high-certainty predictions, while also improving calibration. Radiomic and dosiomic features increased model accuracy but introduced calibration challenges, especially for non-linear models like XGB and RF. Performance gains from UQ methods were most noticeable at higher certainty thresholds. Conclusion: Integrating UQ into ML models with radiomic and dosiomic features improves both predictive accuracy and calibration, supporting more reliable clinical decision-making. The findings emphasize the value of UQ methods in enhancing applicability of predictive models for RP in healthcare settings.

arXiv:2412.19581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable electron spin clusters are of interest for quantum computation, simulation and sensing. However, with interaction length scales of a few tens of nanometers in the strong coupling regime, they are unresolved in conventional confocal microscopy, making individual readout problematic. Here we show that when using a single shot readout technique, collective states of the combined register space become accessible. By using spin to charge conversion of the defects we draw the connection between the intricate photon count statistics with spin state tomography using deep neural networks. This approach is particularly versatile with further scaling the number of constituent spins in a cluster due to complexity of the analytical treatment. We perform a proof of concept measurement of the correlated classical signal, paving the way for using our technique in realistic applications.

Abstract: Paleoclimatic measurements serve to understand Earth System processes and evaluate climate model performances. However, their spatial coverage is generally sparse and unevenly distributed across the globe. Statistical interpolation methods are the prevalent techniques to grid such data, but these purely data-driven approaches sometimes produce results that are incoherent with our knowledge of the physical world. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) follow an innovative approach to data analysis and physical modeling through machine learning, as they incorporate physical principles into the data-driven learning process. Here, we develop PINNs to reconstruct global maps of atmospheric dust surface deposition fluxes from measurement data in paleoclimatic archives for the Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum periods. We design an advection-diffusion equation to consider dominant wind directions at various latitudes, which prevents dust particles from flowing upwind. Our PINN improves on standard kriging interpolation by allowing variable asymmetry around data points. The reconstructions display realistic dust plumes from continental sources towards ocean basins following prevailing winds.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence methods are employed for the first time to construct a surrogate model for plasma turbulence that enables long time transport simulations. The proposed GAIT (Generative Artificial Intelligence Turbulence) model is based on the coupling of a convolutional variational auto-encoder, that encodes precomputed turbulence data into a reduced latent space, and a recurrent neural network and decoder that generates new turbulence states 400 times faster than the direct numerical integration. The model is applied to the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) plasma turbulence model, that is closely related to the quasigeostrophic model used in geophysical fluid dynamics. Very good agreement is found between the GAIT and the HW models in the spatio-temporal Fourier and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition spectra, and the flow topology characterized by the Okubo-Weiss decomposition. The GAIT model also reproduces Lagrangian transport including the probability distribution function of particle displacements and the effective turbulent diffusivity.

Abstract: The persistent underrepresentation of women and other gender minorities in physical science fields has been an ongoing concern. This study investigates gender dynamics in introductory physics laboratory courses, specifically exploring whether students of different gender identities exhibit equal inclination and confidence in conducting lab experiments, and whether they face barriers that impact their participation. The study was conducted across three institutions, involving non-physics students enrolled in algebra-based and calculus-based physics courses. Our findings reveal no significant differences in participation levels across genders in various lab activities. However, a subtle yet significant trended was observed: non-male students tend to express greater preferences and comfort levels for note-taking, calculations, and graphing tasks compared to their male counterparts, who gravitated more towards hands-on equipment handling. Although no overt barriers deterring participation based solely on gender were identified, some students reported experiences or witnessed instances where gender dynamics hindered full engagement, such as assumptions about competence or difficulty asserting voices in male-dominated groups. These findings contribute insights into potential gender-based inclinations and experiences within laboratory environments. The results underscore the importance of fostering an inclusive climate that encourages equitable opportunities and engagement from all gender identities in scientific exploration and learning.

Abstract: The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.

Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a major driver of new surges has been the emergence of new variants. When a new variant emerges in one or more countries, other nations monitor its spread in preparation for its potential arrival. The impact of the new variant and the timings of epidemic peaks in a country highly depend on when the variant arrives. The current methods for predicting the spread of new variants rely on statistical modeling, however, these methods work only when the new variant has already arrived in the region of interest and has a significant prevalence. Can we predict when a variant existing elsewhere will arrive in a given region? To address this question, we propose a variant-dynamics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach. First, we derive the dynamics of variant prevalence across pairs of regions (countries) that apply to a large class of epidemic models. The dynamics motivate the introduction of certain features in the GNN. We demonstrate that our proposed dynamics-informed GNN outperforms all the baselines, including the currently pervasive framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). To advance research in this area, we introduce a benchmarking tool to assess a user-defined model's prediction performance across 87 countries and 36 variants.

Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.

Abstract: Urban pollution poses serious health risks, particularly in relation to traffic-related air pollution, which remains a major concern in many cities. Vehicle emissions contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular issues, especially for vulnerable and exposed road users like pedestrians and cyclists. Therefore, accurate air quality monitoring with high spatial resolution is vital for good urban environmental management. This study aims to provide insights for processing spatiotemporal datasets with high missing data rates. In this study, the challenge of high missing data rates is a result of the limited data available and the fine granularity required for precise classification of PM2.5 levels. The data used for analysis and imputation were collected from both mobile sensors and fixed stations by Dynamic Parcel Distribution, the Environmental Protection Agency, and Google in Dublin, Ireland, where the missing data rate was approximately 82.42%, making accurate Particulate Matter 2.5 level predictions particularly difficult. Various imputation and prediction approaches were evaluated and compared, including ensemble methods, deep learning models, and diffusion models. External features such as traffic flow, weather conditions, and data from the nearest stations were incorporated to enhance model performance. The results indicate that diffusion methods with external features achieved the highest F1 score, reaching 0.9486 (Accuracy: 94.26%, Precision: 94.42%, Recall: 94.82%), with ensemble models achieving the highest accuracy of 94.82%, illustrating that good performance can be obtained despite a high missing data rate.

# Machine Learning Approaches for Developing Potential Surfaces: Applications to OH^-(H$_2$O)$_n$ ($n=1-3$) Complexes

**Authors:** Jiace, Sun

An approach for obtaining high-level ab initio potential surfaces is described.  The approach takes advantage of machine learning strategies in a two-step process.  In the first, the molecular-orbital based machine learning (MOB-ML) model uses Gaussian process regression to learn the correlation energy at the CCSD(T) level using the molecular orbitals obtained from Hartree-Fock calculations.  In this work, the MOB-ML approach is expanded to use orbitals obtained using a smaller basis set, aug-cc-pVDZ, as features for learning the correlation energies at the complete basis set (CBS) limit.  This approach is combined with the development of a neural-network potential, where the sampled geometries and energies that provide the training data for the potential are obtained using a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculation, which was run using the MOB-ML model.   Protocols are developed to make full use of the structures that are obtained from the DMC calculation in the training process.   These approaches are used to develop potentials for OH-(H2O) and H3O+(H2O), which are used for subsequent DMC calculations. The  results of these calculations are compared to those performed using previously reported potentials.   Overall, the results of the two sets of DMC calculations are in good agreement for these very floppy molecules.   Potentials are also developed for OH-(H2O)2 and OH-(H2O)3, for which there are not available potential surfaces.  The results of DMC calculations for these ions are compared to those for the correspondingOH-(H2O)2 and OH-(H2O)3 ions.  It is found that the level of delocalization of the shared proton is similar for a hydroxide or hydronium ion bound to the same number of water molecules.  This finding is consistent with the experimental observation that these sets of ions have similar spectra.

**Authors:** Tamiki, KOMATSUZAKI

The identification of kinetically feasible reaction pathways that connect a reactant to its product, including numerous intermediates and transition states, is crucial for predicting chemical reactions and elucidating reaction mechanisms. However, as molecular systems become increasingly complex or larger, the number of local minimum structures and transition states grows, which makes this task challenging, even with advanced computational approaches. We introduced a reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently identify a kinetically feasible reaction pathway between a given local minimum structure for the reactant and a given one for the product, starting from the reactant. The performance of the algorithm was validated using a benchmark dataset of large-scale chemical reaction path networks. Several search policies were proposed, using metrics based on energetic or structural similarity to the product’s goal structure, for each local minimum structure candidate found during the search. The performances of baseline greedy, random, and uniform search policies varied substantially depending on the system. In contrast, exploration-exploitation balanced policies such as Thompson sampling, probability of improvement, and expected improvement consistently demonstrated stable and high performance. Furthermore, we characterized the search mechanisms that depend on different policies in detail. This study also addressed potential avenues for further research, such as hierarchical reinforcement learning and multi-objective optimization, which could deepen the problem setting explored in this study.

Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as a transformative force in materials science. However, the field still faces significant challenges, primarily the scarcity of comprehensive material datasets and the inefficiencies in utilizing existing data to its full potential. In this work, we propose the CrossMat platform, integrating material databases to accelerate material discovery across diverse applications. Currently encompassing fields such as electrocatalysis, thermocatalysis, photocatalysis, solid-state electrolyte materials, hydrogen storage materials, lithium battery electrolytes, thermoelectric materials, and superconducting materials, CrossMat is driven by large language models and machine learning algorithms to significantly broaden the scope of material prediction. By systematically identifying synthesizable, cost-effective, and environmentally stable materials, CrossMat facilitates their adaptation to previously unexplored domains. This approach not only addresses critical limitations in current methodologies but also opens up innovative avenues for the discovery and development of advanced materials.

**Authors:** Dario A., Estrin

We introduce an innovative machine learning (ML)-based framework for multiscale molecular modeling, in which the ML subsystem is treated as an electrostatic entity interacting with its molecular mechanics (MM) environment through classical electrostatics. The integration of ML accuracy with multiscale modeling is accomplished by leveraging the capabilities of the ANI neural networks to predict geometry-dependent atomic partial charges at the Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) level, going beyond static mechanical embedding. This ML/MM approach can closely approximate state-of-the-art multi-scale quantum-classical (QM/MM) methods while significantly lowering computational requirements, thereby facilitating more efficient and precise simulations in computational chemistry. The method requires no additional training beyond the initial model setup and is integrated into Amber, one of the most widely used software suites for molecular modeling, ensuring accessibility to the broader community. We validate its performance across a variety of challenging applications, including solvation structure, vibrational spectra, torsion free energy profiles, and protein-ligand interactions, achieving excellent agreement with QM/MM benchmarks. This framework not only advances the frontiers of multiscale modeling but also showcases the potential of machine learning to achieve quantum-level accuracy with exceptional efficiency for complex chemical systems.

# Pathogen-specific stomatal responses in cacao leaves to Phytophthora megakarya and Rhizoctonia solani

## 可可叶片对大叶疫霉和水稻纹枯病菌的病原体特异性气孔反应

We investigated the impact of the black pod rot pathogen (Phytophthora megakarya) and a non-pathogenic fungus (Rhizoctonia solani) on stomatal aperture in two cacao genotypes (SCA6 and Pound7) under varying light conditions. Image analysis revealed diverse stomatal responses, including no change, opening, and closure, that were influenced by the interplay of genotype, pathogen strain, and light conditions. Notably, SCA6 exhibited stomatal opening in response to P. megakarya specifically under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, suggesting a light-dependent activation of pathogen virulence factors. In contrast, Pound7 displayed stomatal closure in response to both P. megakarya and R. solani, indicating the potential recognition of conserved Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) and a broader defense response. Machine learning was used to predict stomatal area size and classify pathogen treatments based on stomatal traits in cacao. Size-related traits were the strongest predictors of stomatal area size, while shape-related traits were also significant. This combined approach is promising for disease phenotyping and development of resistant crop varieties.

# Art impacts in museums compared to digital encounters

## 与数字遭遇相比，博物馆中的艺术影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5716793/latest

As cultural consumption increasingly moves to a digital space, it is crucial to understand the evolving landscape of art consumption both in and outside of a physical museum context. The current study delves into this contrast, seeking to understand how art is perceived and appreciated in museums and on a digital medium (like a computer screen). Across two experiments at the Barnes Foundation and Penn Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we explored how the aesthetic engagement of paintings and artifacts is influenced by the physical context in which an artwork is encountered and by the characteristics of the viewer. Our findings suggest that the cognitive and emotional impacts of artworks on viewers, as well as the viewers&amp;rsquo; overall aesthetic experiences are comparable across physical museum spaces and digital platforms. However, participants reported gaining more understanding from art viewed in museums, compared to participants who viewed art in the lab. Art experience and openness to experience influenced aesthetic impacts and ratings differently in the museum and in the lab. Overall, routes to broader valuations of liking were more similar than different between the museum and lab contexts, whereas patterns of impacts that might lead to new knowledge or understanding gained differed between museum and lab contexts. As digital technologies are increasingly integrated into diverse processes in museums such as collections management, curation, exhibitions, and education and learning, our research highlights how museums can leverage digital expansion to achieve their missions as centers of learning and education.

# Wavelet Analysis of ENSO Impact on Rainfall Variability in the Andaman Islands: Implications for Climate Resilience and Predictive Modelling

## 恩索对安达曼群岛降雨变化影响的小波分析: 对气候弹性和预测模型的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5675635/latest

In this research project it is explored how El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects rain patterns on Andaman Islands by employing wavelet analysis methods. The primary research goal is to assess temporal correlations between ENSO phases and local rainfall using both Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Methodology utilized included the analysis of Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) data coupled with local rainfall statistics; Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were then employed to establish relationships. Results revealed a moderate negative relationship (Pearson coefficient =-0.31) between ONI values and annual rainfall; higher ONI levels associated with El Nino events tend to correlate to reduced precipitation across the region. Additionally, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks in predictive modelling significantly improved forecast accuracy as evidenced by their R-squared value of 0.95 and their relative risk-maximization error estimate of 0.15. This implies a complex interrelation between global climate events and regional hydrological responses; further challenging prior assumptions of ENSO's effects. These insights contribute to improving regional climate dynamics knowledge, underscoring the role of ENSO in rainfall variability prediction, supporting improved climate resilience efforts as well as predictive modelling efforts in Andaman Islands.

# Integrative Machine Learning Approaches to Identify and Validate Gene Biomarkers for Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

## 整合机器学习方法识别和验证基因生物标志物在肝细胞癌早期检测中的应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5720650/latest

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and prognosis is poor if the disease is detected at advanced stages. There is an urgent need for early diagnostic biomarkers to facilitate timely interventions. Current diagnostic methods, such as liver function tests (LFTs), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) panels, and imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound, lack specificity for HCC and do not provide a comprehensive prognosis. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) based approach for identifying early HCC biomarkers using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. We analyzed publicly available RNA-seq datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), UCSC Xena, and GEO RNA-seq Experiments Interactive Navigator (GREIN). In this study, we performed various feature selection methods using ML with a Random Forest (RF) model, achieving the best performance in identifying and predicting the top most significantly important genes. Bioinformatics tools, including Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING), Gene Ontology (GO), DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery), the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) were used for validation. Through our analysis, we identified six potential early-detection gene biomarkers for HCC: CDKN3, LIFR, MKI67, TOP2A, SLC5A1, and VIPR1.

A diverse patient-reported Quality-of-life(QoL) scale attempts to predict outcomes for aNSCLC patients received atezolizumab using machine learning.Materials and Methods This study analysized the association between baseline QoL and clinical outcome in aNSCLC patients received atezolizumab in 4 randomized clinical trials: the IMpower150 study (discovery cohort), the BIRCH, OAK and POPLAR study (validation cohorts). We identified quality of life subtypes (QoLS) by consensus clustering in the discovery cohort and predicted them in external validated cohorts.Results We identified QoLS1 and QoLS2 via consensus clustering in the discovery cohort. Compared with QoLS2, patients in QoLS1 had a significantly longer median OS(13.14 vs. 21.42 months, hazard ratio [HR] 2.07 [1.64&amp;ndash;2.62]; p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.0001) and PFS(5.7 vs. 8.3 months, HR 1.70 [1.42&amp;ndash;2.04]; p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.0001), and higher clinical benefit rates( 68% vs 57% ,p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.0027) with 6, 12 and 24-month time-dependent AUC of 0.61, 0.6 and 0.53 for OS, respectively. We observed similar favorable trends for OS (p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.0001) for predicted QoLS1 in the external cohorts using the PAM algorithm. Additionally, QoLS1 served as a strong predictive biomarkers for atezolizumab (ICI)-treated aNSCLC patients in comparison with chemotherapy (non-ICI)-treated patients regarding OS in both the IMpower150 trial (QoLS1: HR ICI vs. non&amp;minus;ICI = 1.30, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.04; QoLS2: HR ICI vs. non&amp;minus;ICI = 1.21, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.2) and the OAK&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;POPLAR trials (QoLS1: HR ICI vs. non&amp;minus;ICI = 1.27, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.007; QoLS2: HR ICI vs. non&amp;minus;ICI = 1.21, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.07).Conclusions Our study demonstrated the potential of integrative machine learning in effectively analyzing QoL and predicting clinical outcomes in aNSCLC patients undergoing atezolizumab immunotherapy.

Background: Accurate assessment of the risk of distant metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is important for the development of personalized treatment and prognosis. The purpose of this study was to explore the risk factors for distant metastasis of HNSCC and to establish a predictive model using machine learning methods.
Materials and methods: We designed a retrospective cross-sectional study with a cohort from the SEER database (affiliated with the National Cancer Institute). A total of 31,060 cases of head and neck cancer were included by our inclusion criteria. We constructed four machine learning models&mdash;Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Neural Network&mdash;to predict the risk of distant metastasis in HNSCC patients and compared the performance of the four models. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate the performance of the model. The evaluation ability and clinical practicability of the model were verified by comparing the area under the curve and the receiver operating characteristic curve.
Results: The receiver operating characteristic of the four models ranged from 0.681 to 0.847. The average accuracy of all algorithms was 77 %, and XGBoost had the highest accuracy of 85.119 %. Among the four models, XGBoost and Logistic Regression had the highest precision, both with precision greater than 79. Neural Network had the highest recall and F1-score. Decision Tree had the lowest accuracy and recall. Among the four models, the area under the curve of Decision Tree was the lowest, at 0.690, whereas that of XGBoost was the highest, at 0.846. Overall, XGBoost had the best predictive effect.

## 智能灾害预测: 地震和洪水的统一机器学习方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5717395/latest

Natural disaster prediction is vital for the minimization of effects of these calamities on human life and infrastructure. The aim of this research work is to find an application of machine learning algorithms in earthquake magnitude and flood event prediction. This is achieved using historical seismic data, provided by the Indian Meteorological Department and United States Geological Survey. This paper was trained by optimizing the Random Forest model using RandomizedSearchCV. The model had a MAE of 14.5%, RMSE of 19.8%, and an R-squared value of 0.75, thus it proved to be efficient in the prediction of earthquake magnitudes. For flood prediction, a Voting Classifier ensemble model was used that comprised XGBoost, Random Forest, KNN and Decision Tree and, for the prediction of flood events with environmental and socioeconomic factors. The ensemble model presented significant results with an accuracy of 93.64%, precision of 89%, recall of 85%, and an F1-Score of 87%, which shows how this model is robust in flood-non-flood classification. Results therefore indicate the potentiality that machine learning models have for improving disaster prediction by indicating the strength of the ensemble methods in improving early preparedness, resource allocation, and early warning systems.

# Progressive feature learning and multiplicative feature fusion network for corn disease recognition

## 渐进式特征学习与乘性特征融合网络在玉米病害识别中的应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5711522/latest

Accurate and fast corn leaf disease recognition has attracted increasing interest in recent years, which is of great significance for promoting corn production efficiency and quality. In this paper, we propose a progressive feature learning and multiplicative feature fusion Network (PFMNet) for corn leaf disease recognition. Our approach leverages cloud services for efficient data storage, processing, and scalability. Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale feature learning module (MFLM) consisting of three parallel branches, which collaboratively learns the features from the input images, whole objects, and discriminative parts of objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. This helps discover the subtle areas of lesions and suppress the complex background noise to enhance the feature discriminability, especially for the in-field scenes with overlapped, bent and distorted corn leaves. By mapping the features at different branches to a shared latent space and producing the channel attention for each branch, we further design a multiplicative feature fusion module (MFFM), which helps aggregate different scale features in a synergistic way. Extensive experimental results quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can achieve an accuracy of 97.14% and recall of 97.36% on the corn leaf disease recognition benchmark. The integration of cloud services enhances the scalability and practicality of our solution for widespread deployment in agricultural applications.

# MOAC-RT: Personalized Multi-Objective Radiotherapy using Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Moac-rt: 使用演员评论家深度强化学习的个性化多目标放射治疗

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5637868/latest

Radiotherapy (RT) stands as on the common approaches in the treatment of cancer patients, delivering a specified radiation dosage across multiple sessions, progressively targeting the tumor for gradual eradication. Traditional RT uses fixed schedules and constant dose fractions. However, different patients may respond differently to radiation treatment based on different reasons. Effective treatment planning is crucial in RT to maximize treatment quality, balancing tumor irradiation and healthy tissue preservation, making it a multi-objective problem. Also, since this treatment is conducted over several sessions, it is inherently a sequential decision-making problem. This paper models RT treatment planning as a multi-objective reinforcement learning problem, using a 2D tumor growth simulation incorporating factors like oxygen levels, glucose distribution, and cell status. We propose an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning approach base on MobileNetV2 pretrained network, called MOAC-RT, to optimize the RT treatment plan (dosage and schedule) for radiotherapy. The results show that personalized RT treatment plan, where a dose between 1 to 2 Gy is delivered to the tumor based on its status, and the rest time is chosen considering the effect of radiation on the tumor and the status of healthy cell, can outperform standard approach and previous works as it accomplishes the treatment in less time and with fewer prescribed doses, requiring a reduced number of sessions.

# Dietary and Serum Micronutrients Associations with Lung Cancer: Results from the NHANES 1988-2018 and Mendelian randomization study

## 饮食和血清微量营养素与肺癌的关系: 来自NHANES 1988 2018和孟德尔随机化研究的结果

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5691131/latest

Background Numerous studies suggest a link between nutrients and lung cancer (LC) development, previous researches have produced conflicting results regarding the effects of diet-derived nutrient levels on LC risk. This study investigates the causal relationships between different types of lung cancer&amp;mdash;including lung adenocarcinoma (LA), squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC)&amp;mdash;and 12 dietary micronutrients, while also including calcium as an important mineral nutrient. We used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to prove these associations, both in terms of diet and serum.Methods We selected instrumental variables (IVs) for the micronutrients based on recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and derived summary statistics for LC involving 33,057 cases and 545,462 controls. The causal inference analysis utilized the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, complemented by sensitivity analyses to validate the assumptions. The NHANES data, collected from 1988 to 2018, helped explore these associations, employing random forest imputation for missing data, propensity score analysis for confounding adjustment, and subgroup analyses to assess nutrient-cancer relationships. Machine learning techniques identified micronutrient most significantly associated with LC.Results Our findings suggest that higher dietary concentrations of vitamin B12 (OR: 0.30), zinc (OR: 0.06 for LA), vitamin D (OR: 0.60 for LA), and selenium (OR: 0.003 for SCLC) correlate with reduced LC risk.  In the NHANES cohort of 14,421 participants, LC patients exhibited lower dietary intakes of the 12 micronutrients despite higher serum concentrations. Notably, machine learning results showed that elevated serum concentrations of calcium, zinc, and copper may also reduce the risk of LC.Conclusions These results indicate that zinc may protect against LC, particularly LA, while evidence for other nutrients is insufficient. The study also emphasizes the need for improved nutritional supplementation in LC patients.

# Deep learning-based skin lesion classification for cancer detection

## 用于癌症检测的基于深度学习的皮肤病变分类

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5675190/latest

Early detection is crucial for a successful remedy of skin cancer and an upsurge of longevity, as it is one of the most ubiquitous kinds of cancer globally. This project introduces a skin cancer detection system that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to autonomously classify skin lesions into distinct categories based on image inputs. The system employs deep learning techniques to analyse images and forecast the presence of several types of malignancy for the skin, including malignancies of basal cells and melanoma. The algorithm was honed using a dataset of tagged skin lesion pictures, incorporating advanced techniques such as Batch Normalization and Max Pooling to prevent overfitting and improve accuracy. In order to minimize overfitting, dropout layers were included, and the architecture was improved to optimize the model's functionality. The prediction findings are later displayed through a web-based interface that was constructed using Flask. Users are able to submit skin pictures and receive thorough findings, which include information about the expected cancer type. The objective of this system is to facilitate the diagnosis of skin cancer more efficiently for dermatologists and healthcare professionals by offering automated, high-accuracy predictions. The system may be expanded to include a mobile application in the future, which would provide a wider range of accessibility for the rapid identification of malignancy.

# Enhancing Malaria Detection and Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks - Vision Transformer Architecture

## 使用卷积神经网络增强疟疾检测和分类-Vision Transformer Architecture

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5019953/latest

Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite advancements in treatment and prevention, malaria continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women. Although effective, traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopy, are time-consuming and require skilled personnel prone to human error, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. More so, existing machine learning models used in malaria detection and classification have low performance and overfitting issues. This study presents an enhanced malaria detection and classification model using an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). The proposed ensemble model, which combines CNN and ViT, outperforms each individual model, achieving an accuracy of 99.64%, precision of 99.23%, recall of 99.75%, F1 score of 99.51%, and a cross-entropy loss of 0.01. The proposed model demonstrated superior performance compared to those reported in the literature. These results highlight the potential of the CNN-ViT ensemble model for accurate and reliable malaria detection, offering a significant improvement over existing methods.

# Production, Exports, and R&amp;amp;D Strategies: A Dynamic and Heterogeneous Analysis

## 生产、出口与研发战略: 一个动态的异质性分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5715055/latest

This paper develops a dynamic model of firms with heterogeneous production levels making optimal decisions regarding exports and R&amp;amp;D investment, and both choices endogenously affect firms&rsquo; production growth. In a closed economy, firms determine how much to invest in one of two R&amp;amp;D strategies: independent innovation or dependent imitation. In an open economy, firms decide not only on R&amp;amp;D investment but also on whether and how much to export. To comprehensively capture firm-level growth dynamics, the model incorporates both self-selection and learning-by-exporting mechanisms. Our model identifies production thresholds which determine whether firms choose to export, and whether to imitate or to innovate. As expected, only sufficiently productive firms choose to export. Notably, the most productive non-exporters choose to innovate, while the most productive exporters prefer imitation. Additionally, as firms become more productive, they tend to reduce both their R&amp;amp;D investment and the proportion of production they export. This paper then moves further to seek for support from the empirical evidence. Based on panel data of global firms observed from 2011 to 2019, multiple tests robustly support these theoretical findings, confirming that complex multilateral relationships exist among firms&rsquo; production, exports, and R&amp;amp;D strategies. The paper concludes with a discussion of findings and policy implications.

# Enhancing Real-time Heading Estimation for Pedestrian Navigation Via Deep Learning and Smartphone Embeded Sensors

## 通过深度学习和智能手机嵌入传感器增强行人导航的实时航向估计

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5625572/latest

The accurate smartphone-based pedestrian navigation significantly depends on the precise heading estimation. However, heading estimation is still a challenging problem in most pedestrian navigation applications because of the bias of low-cost smartphone sensors, thermal drift with long-term operation, and the unexpected changes in the carrying mode of handheld devices. To address these challenges, many existing methods based on pervasive resources encounter severe errors. Conversely, auxiliary resources-based approaches may hinder ubiquitous and seamless indoor-outdoor navigation experiences. This research aims to enhance heading estimation by leveraging pervasive measurements such as LVGOs and straight-line features self-recognized from camera images. The proposed method mitigates the accumulated gyro drift using the absolute heading angle estimated by LVGOs. However, these absolute angles are highly prone to false estimation while navigating near areas with high electric and magnetic activities due to stable geomagnetism anomalies. Encouraged by the pervasiveness of straight-line features in indoor and outdoor environments, we developed a deep learning method-based visual tracking of these features to enhance the gyroscope and magnetic field fusion-based heading estimation. A convolutional neural network was developed using a U-Net network to accurately and quickly recognize these features, then leverage them as heading constraint to overcome long-term gyro drift and short-term compass heading bias. The proposed method superiorly ensured the balance between recognition time delay and precision, which enabled smooth real-time performance. The achieved results improved the heading estimation and could provide significant help, especially for visually impaired people, as they mostly track tactile paving. This encourages future tests and assessments using visually impaired people to reliably include the proposed method in their applications.

# Assessing the Performance of Domain-Specific Models for Plant Leaf Disease Classification: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Transfer-Learning on Open Datasets

## 评估植物叶病分类的特定领域模型的性能: 开放数据集上转移学习的综合基准

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5668089/latest

Agriculture and its yields are indispensable to human life all over the planet. It is an essential part of many countries&rsquo; economies and without it the world&rsquo;s population can not be fed. As such, guaranteeing harvest with minimal loss is a primary objective. One factor that heavily contributes to loss in crop harvesting are plant diseases, which often affect crops and their leaves. A plant&rsquo;s leaf often carries symptoms that indicate whether or not a plant is infected, but traditional manual approaches to identifying these symptoms are tedious and laborious. Additionally the process of manually spotting diseases can be rather slow in a field where urgency and fast identification are very important. The sooner a disease gets identified, the sooner countermeasures can be carried out. To improve both the accuracy with which diseases can be recognized, as well as increasing the speed at which this can be carried out, deep learning methods have proven useful. Recently the field of plant disease recognition has seen a big uptick in the application of various convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the automatic classification of diseases. There exist many different highly-capable models at this time. There also exists a range of plant leaf disease classification image datasets containing different plants and diseases. However, there seems to be no consensus on which model is best suited to handle this task and the same can be said for the datasets. To the best of our knowledge, prior work has used a wide range of different models with different datasets in the way of feasibility studies, but without comprehensively identifying which models are best used in this field. In this work we test a large number of state-of-the-art CNN models on a wide range of openly available datasets to asses their performance and to identify models that are best suited for this field, in order to be able to built better models, and even new foundation models, based on these findings. 23 models have been tested on 18 datasets, both using transfer-learning and transfer-learning with additional fine-tuning added, for 5 iterations each. Transfer-learning allows models to utilize knowledge obtained from other previous tasks to be used for new tasks, reducing training time and lowering the need for training data. The experiments result in a total of 4,140 having been trained for this work. All results will be compared and contextualized in order to find the best models architecture for plant leaf disease classification as well as assessing which datasets are well suited for this task.

# Machine learning-driven analysis of geophysical wellbore data for underground storage applications

## 用于地下存储应用的地球物理井筒数据的机器学习驱动分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5721089/latest

This study explores the application of data-driven approaches to enhance the interpretation of geophysical wellbore data for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the Illinois Basin. Extensive data from exploration and pilot-scale projects are analyzed to assess their potential for generating synthetic datasets that can effectively replicate some missing information for ongoing projects. Specifically, various machine learning (ML) models, including random forest, gradient boosting, feed-forward neural networks, and others, are employed to predict sonic velocities based on mineralogical composition and to identify fracture locations using petrophysical logs. ML-based approaches significantly outperform the traditional effective media interpretation, exhibiting improved accuracy in sonic velocity prediction and capturing small-scale heterogeneity of the formations. However, the prediction of fracture presence remains a challenge due to data imbalance and the complex interplay between fractures and inherent heterogeneity of geologic formations. Application of T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) - advanced technique for multidimensional data visualization reveals that spatial heterogeneity strongly influences geophysical properties, limiting ML models' performance in detecting fractures. Despite these challenges, ML approaches show promise in complementing traditional methodologies, enabling faster and more informed decision-making process during early project stages. Future research is needed to address data limitations and enhance the reliability of ML models in diverse geological settings.

# Network Intrusion Detection based on Feature Fusion of Attack Dimension

## 基于攻击维数特征融合的网络入侵检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5714403/latest

Network traffic anomaly detection involves the rapid identification of intrusions within a network through the detection, analysis, and classification of network traffic data.The variety of cyber attacks encompasses diverse attack principles. Employing an indiscriminate feature selection strategy may lead to the neglect of key features highly correlated with specific attack types. This oversight could diminish the recognition rate for that category, thereby impacting the overall performance of the detection model.To address this issue, this paper proposes a network traffic anomaly detection model based on the fusion of attack-dimensional features. Firstly, construct binary classification datasets independently for each attack class and perform individual feature selection to extract positively correlated features for each class. The features are then fused by employing a combination methods. Subsequently, based on the fused sub-datasets, base classifiers are trained. Finally, an ensemble learning approach is introduced to integrate the predictions of individual classifiers, enhancing the robustness of the model.The proposed approach, validated on NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 benchmark datasets, outperforms the latest methods in the field by achieving a \(2%\) and \(7%\) increase in precision on weighted averages.

This study suggests a hybrid optimization model and a new deep learning technique to create an effective deepfake detection system. During the preprocessing stage, deepfake database images are improved by employing Gaussian Filter and Histogram Equalization and are ready for analysis. The recently proposed Improved Local Ternary Patterns (I-LTP) approach collects textural and temporal information for feature extraction. The advanced GeoFisherNet, which effectively integrates spatial and temporal properties, is then utilized to fuse these data.

## B部分: 创新的数据分析方法，以提高机器学习的航海目的; 计算效率

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5709408/latest

The increasing influence of AI across various scientific domains has prompted engineering to &amp;nbsp;embark on new explorations for complex challenges. However, recent studies often overlook &amp;nbsp;the foundational aspects of the maritime field, leading to over-optimistic or oversimplified &amp;nbsp;outputs for real-world application purposes. To address these concerns, in previous works, we highlighted the sensitivity of trained models to noise, computational efficiency, and the &amp;nbsp;necessity for feature engineering/compactness in seakeeping given the stochastic nature of the &amp;nbsp;wave. In response, a novel data analysis framework was introduced with two purposes to &amp;nbsp;augment data for machine learning (ML) models in seakeeping: transferring features from high-fidelity to low-fidelity modelling which resulted in improving feature accuracy for simulation &amp;nbsp;and increasing computational efficiency through feature engineering; the current issue &amp;nbsp;addresses the second objectives. To this end, the experimental data of a spherical model in a &amp;nbsp;wave basin excited by different waves has been employed. The response time series of the &amp;nbsp;model underwent a continuous wavelet transform to extract fine spectral-temporal features. &amp;nbsp;After feature reorganization based on coefficient intensity in a new feature map, additional &amp;nbsp;endogenous features are attached to the arrays to improve feature variability and entropy. &amp;nbsp;Different ML models were trained, where the new data analysis framework substantially &amp;nbsp;reduced training costs while maintaining fair accuracy, with training times slashed from hours &amp;nbsp;to seconds. The significance of the current study extends beyond the maritime context and can &amp;nbsp;be utilised for ML applications in intrinsically stochastic data.
