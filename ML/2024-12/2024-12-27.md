**Authors:** Samuel, Blau

Applications of deep learning (DL) to design nanomaterials are hampered by a lack of suitable data representations and training data. We report efforts to overcome these limitations and leverage DL to optimize the nonlinear optical properties of core-shell upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs). UCNPs, which have applications in e.g., biosensing, super-resolution microscopy, and 3D printing, can emit visible and ultraviolet light from near-infrared excitations. We report the first large-scale dataset of UCNP emission spectra based on accurate but expensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations (N > 6,000) and use this data to train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) using a novel representation of UCNP nanostructure. Applying gradient-based optimization on the trained GNN, we identify structures with 6.5 times higher predicted emission under 800nm illumination than any UCNP in our training set. Our work reveals new design principles for UCNPs and presents a roadmap for DL-based inverse design of nanomaterials.

# Predicting Fluorescence Emission Wavelengths and Quantum Yields via Machine Learning

## 通过机器学习预测荧光发射波长和量子产率

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-fhzdt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Julio Cesar, Duarte

The search for functional fluorescent organic materials can significantly benefit from rapid and accurate predictions of photophysical properties. However, screening large numbers of potential fluorophore molecules in different solvents faces the limitations of quantum mechanical calculations and experimental measurements. In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the fluorescence of a molecule focusing on two target properties: emission wavelengths (WLs) and quantum yield (QYs). For this purpose, we employ the Deep4Chem database containing optical properties of 20,236 combinations of 7,016 chromophores in 365 different solvents. Several chemical descriptors, or features, were selected as inputs for each model, and each molecule was characterized by its SMILES fingerprint. The Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) technique was used to rationalize the results, showing that the most impactful properties are chromophore-related, as expected from chemical intuition. For the best-performing model, the Random Forest, our results for the test set show a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 28.8 nm for WL and 0.19 for QY. The developed ML models were used to predict, thus complete, the missing results for the WL and QY target properties in the original Deep4Chem database, resulting in two new databases, one for each property. Testing our ML models for each target property in molecules not included in the Deep4Chem database presented good results.

## 用于过渡态几何预测的机器学习

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wdtz9-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Matthew N., Grayson

The calculation of transition state (TS) geometries is essential for understanding reaction mechanisms and rational synthetic methodology design. However, traditional methods like density functional theory (DFT) are often too computationally expensive for large-scale TS identification and are significantly slower than high-throughput experimental screening methods. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) offer promising alternatives, enabling the direct prediction of TS geometries, reducing the reliance on expensive quantum mechanical (QM) calculations and affording predictions ahead of experiment. The works explored here include the broader application of ML in reaction property prediction, emphasising how accurate TS geometries can serve as vital input data to improve model accuracy. A comprehensive review of ML methods developed to explicitly predict TS geometries are then presented, with attention to their application in downstream tasks, such as energy barrier calculations, and their use as initial structures for further optimisation via QM methods. Finally, a critical evaluation of the accuracy and limitations of existing TS prediction methods are discussed, highlighting challenges that impede wider adoption and areas where further research is needed.

**Authors:** Tong , Zhu

The accurate computation of reaction energy and reaction barrier height is indispensable for the investigation of chemical reaction mechanisms and rates. In this research, we employ the Deep post-Hartree Fock (DeePHF) model in conjunction with the local density matrix derived from different base quantum chemistry methods (HF, PBE, B3LYP, M06-2X and $\omega$B97M-V). Through extensive training on high-precision small molecule reaction data, including reaction structures and high-precision NEB (Nudged Elastic Band) trajectories, our model showcases better performance across various reaction barrier height datasets compared to the common density functional theory(DFT). The precision of the model rivals that of the double hybrid functionals. Notably, DeePHF maintains high accuracy even when applied to small molecules, medium-sized molecules, and standard benchmark reactions datasets, displaying its substantial advantage in exploring reaction potential energy profiles.

# Targeted Molecular Generation With Latent Reinforcement Learning

## 具有潜在强化学习的目标分子生成

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-8k8gr?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Govinda, Bhisetti

Computational methods for generating molecules with specific physiochemical properties or biolog- ical activity can greatly assist drug discovery efforts. Deep learning generative models constitute a significant step towards that direction. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes a Reinforcement Learning paradigm, called proximal policy optimization (PPO), for optimizing chemical molecules in the latent space of a pre-trained deep learning generative model. Working in the latent space of a generative model allows us to bypass the need for explicitly defining chemical rules when computationally designing molecules. The generation of molecules with desired properties is achieved through navigating the latent space for identifying regions that correspond to molecules with desired properties. Proximal policy optimization is a state-of-the-art policy gradient algorithm capable of operating in continuous high dimensional spaces in a sample-efficient manner. We have paired our optimization framework with the latent spaces of two autoencoder models, a variational autoencoder and an autoencoder trained with mutual information machine loss respectively, showing that the method is agnostic to the underlying architecture. We present results on commonly used benchmarks for molecule optimization that demonstrate that our method has comparable or even superior performance to state-of-the-art approaches. We additionally show how our method can generate molecules that contain a pre-specified substructure while simultaneously optimizing for molecular properties, a task highly relevant to real drug discovery scenarios.

## 通过优化子载波分配和功率控制提高OFDMA网络的频谱利用率和能量效率

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5707349/latest

The increasing demand for efficient spectrum utilization and energy conservation in wireless communication systems has highlighted Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) as a key enabling technology. However, existing optimization techniques, such as Genetic Algorithms, Machine Learning-based methods, and the Water-filling Algorithm, face challenges related to scalability and computational complexity. This study presents an optimized framework for enhancing spectrum utilization and energy efficiency in OFDMA networks, modelled with 10 users, 256 subcarriers, a system bandwidth of 100 MHz, and operating at a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 20 dB. Utilizing 16-QAM modulation and adhering to a per-user power constraint of 2 units, the proposed framework integrates adaptive subcarrier allocation and power control. The methodology employs simulation-based analysis to evaluate performance under realistic network conditions. Results demonstrate significant improvements, achieving an average spectrum utilization of 0.69141 and an average energy efficiency of 1.4447, indicating the method&rsquo;s effectiveness in maximizing resource allocation while minimizing energy consumption. This research bridges theoretical models with practical applications, contributing to the advancement of cognitive radio networks by providing a scalable and efficient solution for spectrum access. The proposed approach reduces interference and enhances operational efficiency, offering valuable insights for the deployment of large-scale OFDMA systems in next-generation communication networks.

## 石灰石处理的建筑垃圾骨料对砂浆性能的影响: 使用响应面方法进行优化

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5705458/latest

Multiple sectors, including agriculture and construction, have produced large amounts of waste in recent years, leading to significant environmental problems. The construction sector is currently faced with the severe difficulties of decreasing natural resources and a growing dependence on waste management, highlighting the need for quick action for an approach to recycling and the introduction of alternative materials. The study concentrates on recycling waste materials and developing innovative construction products. This includes replacing 20% of cement with limestone powder and rice husk, replacing 50% of fine aggregates with construction and demolition waste, and incorporating 1% coconut fiber. The evaluation of these materials involved conducting tests to assess compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength using cube, cylinder, and beam samples parallel to water absorption and non-distractive tests. The methods in machine learning, including Response Surface Methodology, were utilized for prediction, showing enhanced hardened properties. This study suggests that incorporating waste materials into construction practices can protect natural resources and provide sustainable options for the future.

# Uniform Regularization and Constrative Learning to Mitigate the Long-Tail Effect of Recommendation Algorithms

## 统一正则化和Constrative学习减轻推荐算法的长尾效应

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5674769/latest

In recommender systems, Graph Collaborative Filtering (GCF) is widely used for its ability to effectively model the interaction between users and items. However, in practical scenarios, GCF faces a significant problem: the representation of popular items tends to be over-concentrated, while cold items are marginalized, leading to recommendation results biased towards popular items and making it difficult to address the issue of long-tail distribution. To alleviate data sparsity, existing GCF methods typically incorporate Contrastive Learning (CL) to assist in updating node representations. However, inappropriate CL methods can introduce extra noise. For this reason, this paper proposes an Enhanced Contrastive Learning-based Graph Collaborative Filtering (ECL-GCF). The model improves the traditional GCF approach by: 1. capturing explicit interaction information between users and items by exploiting structural neighborhood contrastive learning; 2. introducing semantic neighborhood contrastive learning to construct potential similarity relationships by capturing implicit semantic information of users and items, thereby providing more meaningful representations for cold items; and 3. optimizing the embedding representation by regularizing chi-square and homogeneous embedding representations, ensuring that the embeddings are both close to positive sample pairs and uniformly distributed in the space, thus preventing the marginalization of cold items. Experimental results indicate that the model improves recommendation performance by approximately 5% on the Yelp2018 and iFashion datasets, and especially performs well on cold item recommendation.

# Developing and Validating a Machine Learning-Based Model for Predicting In-Hospital Mortality Among ICU-Admitted Heart Failure Patients: A Study Utilizing the MIMIC-III Database

## 开发和验证基于机器学习的模型，以预测ICU收治的心力衰竭患者的住院死亡率: 一项利用mimic-iii数据库的研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5649681/latest

Background: Although the assessment of in-hospital mortality risk among heart failure patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is crucial for clinical decision-making, there is currently a lack of comprehensive models accurately predicting their prognosis. Machine learning techniques offer a powerful means to identify potential risk factors and predict outcomes within multivariable clinical data.
Methods: This study, based on the MIMIC-III database, extracted demographic characteristics, vital signs, laboratory test values, and comorbidity information of heart failure patients using structured query language. LASSO regression was employed for feature selection, and various machine learning algorithms were utilized to train models, including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), among others. An ensemble learning model based on soft voting mechanism was constructed. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and AUC values through cross-validation and on an independent test set.
Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the soft voting ensemble learning model demonstrated the best overall performance, with accuracy and AUC values both at 0.86. Additionally, RF and GB models also performed well, with RF achieving an accuracy of 0.79 and an AUC of 0.79 on the independent test set, while GB model achieved an accuracy of 0.77 and an AUC of 0.79. In contrast, other models such as LR, SVM, and KNN exhibited poorer performance in terms of accuracy and AUC values, indicating the significant advantage of ensemble methods in handling complex clinical prediction tasks.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning models, particularly ensemble learning models based on soft voting mechanism, in predicting in-hospital mortality risk among heart failure patients in the ICU. The overall performance of the ensemble learning model confirms its effectiveness as an adjunct clinical decision-making tool. Future research should further optimize the models and validate them in a broader patient population to enhance their practical utility and accuracy in real clinical settings.

## 基于跨部门表达和异常的人群情绪分类

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5709790/latest

The crowd emotion sensing is a critical element in surveillance and management of the crowd in different environments. With exploding populations, and developing nations, the crowd in urban cities mandate state of art surveillance methodologies involving continuous monitoring and reporting of criminal activities. The research article presents a novel technique to compute the spatial and temporal features obtained from the crowd environments and combine the novelty of neural networks for detecting the emotions of crowds with better accuracy and swiftness. The features are obtained from the continuous feed of surveillance videos typically categorized into the common features of human beings namely anger, sadness, disgust, surprise, fear, happiness and obviously neutrality. Such features are extracted after careful background separation which are typically difficult in crowded environments, using techniques namely SIFT, and FAST termed to be the visual descriptors. Once the features are extracted, spatial and temporal features are classified into individual and combined features as defined in the cross-division environment in order to portray the crowd dynamics and characteristics. Cross division environment computes the necessary features for identifying the anomalies in the crowded situations in a neural network, after a series of operations such as dimensionality reduction, and principal component analysis. From the semantic information, crowd behaviours are detected based on interactive features in a dynamic environment and the proposed technique has demonstrated effective results in terms of 98.9% accuracy in detecting especially violence in crowd datasets collected from UMN.

# Has high quality economic development alleviated Multidimensional relative poverty?

## 高质量的经济发展缓解了多维相对贫困吗？

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5712332/latest

Alleviating Multidimensional relative poverty(MRP) is indispensable for achieving Chinese modernization. Utilizing the Chinese Family Panel Studies(CFPS) data spanning from 2014 to 2022, we constructed an evaluation index system for both MRP and high-quality economic development(EHD) levels. Furthermore, we introduced the BP neural network method for precise measurement of these development levels. Concurrently, we analyzed the influence and underlying mechanisms of EHD on MRP from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our research findings indicate the following: (ⅰ) EHD significantly mitigates the issue of MRP. This conclusion remains valid after conducting robustness tests and addressing endogeneity concerns. (ⅱ) Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of EHD exhibits significant variability on MRP. Specifically, it has a more pronounced inhibitory effect on younger age groups, those with low social capital, rural residents, and low-income groups. (ⅲ) Mechanism analysis demonstrates that EHD can alleviate MRP by fostering the development of digital inclusive finance, enhancing infrastructure construction, and increasing employment opportunities. This study offers valuable theoretical insights and decision-making references for addressing MRP.

# Research on luminaire paint defect detection model based on improved YOLOv10

## 基于改进YOLOv10的灯具油漆缺陷检测模型研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5654333/latest

Aiming at the problems of low detection accuracy, low computational efficiency and poor detection ability of multi-scale targets in existing detection methods, an improved YOLOv10 algorithm was proposed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of multi-scale defect detection of luminaire paint. By introducing the LSKA attention mechanism to the SPPF module on the YOLOv10 feature extraction backbone network, the recognition ability of the complex form of paint defects of lamps is improved. At the same time, the lightweight design of C2f and detection head module makes the algorithm more suitable for real-time application scenarios. In terms of evaluation indexes, after ablation experiments, the improved algorithm has improved 2.6% compared with the original YOLOv10 in main performance indexes mAP@0.5. In addition, the lightweight design of the improved algorithm significantly reduces the number of parameters and the amount of computation required. Compared with the original YOLOv10, the number of parameters is reduced by 0.22&amp;times;106 and the amount of computation is reduced by 1.4GFLOPS, making it more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The improved YOLOv10 algorithm proposed in this paper achieves a balance of high accuracy and high efficiency in the multi-scale defect detection of luminaire paint surface, providing a reliable machine learning technical means for industrial production, and helping industrial equipment to carry out efficient monitoring and diagnosis under unattended conditions.

# Deep Learning methods for reducing metal artifact in Non-Contrast Brain CT Images with Neurovascular Coils

## 神经血管线圈减少非对比脑部CT图像金属伪影的深度学习方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5648275/latest

Background
Metal artifacts from neurovascular coil effect image quality in computed tomography (CT), we aim to use two deep learning (DL) methods -- convolutional neural network based metal artifact reduction (CNN-MAR)and dual domain network (DuDoNet) to reduce metal artifacts, and compare these methods with two traditional metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods -- Metal Artifact Reduction for Orthopedic Implants (O-MAR) and sinogram completion fused physical model (SCFPM).
Methods
40 consecutive patients with Neurovascular Coil who underwent brain CT between July 2021 to December 2022 were included. Above methods were compared quantitatively by calculating the Hounsfield Units (HU), standard deviation (SD), contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and artifact index (AI). Two radiologists who were blinded to these MAR methods assessed qualitatively the Neurovascular Coil datas for metal artifact and diagnose confidence, resolution, new artifacts and the contours of different soft tissue interfaces utilizing a five-point scale. Friedman M test was used for quantitative and qualitative evaluation.
Results
The HU, SD and AI were significantly lower in DuDoNet images when compared with Filtered back projection (FBP), O-MAR, CNN-MAR images (p＜0.001), although no statistically significant when compared with SCFPM images. The CNR was not significantly different among FBP, O-MAR, SCFPM, CNN-MAR and DuDoNet methods (p=0.596). For artifact and diagnosis confidence score, SCFPM method was significantly higher than FBP, O-MAR, DuDoNet methods (p＜0.001, p=0.010, p=0.015, respectively) although no statistically significant when compared with CNN-MAR method. The resolution and contours of different soft tissue interfaces score were lower in DuDoNet images when compared with other images (all p&amp;lt;0.001). The SCFPM method introduces the least new artifacts among these MAR methods. In addition, using tradional or deep learning methods, we found new lesion obscured by metal artifacts in two cases.
Conclusions
For Quantitative Image Analysis, DuDoNet achieved the best image quality. For qualitative Image Analysis SCFPM achieved the best image quality. DuDonet method can cause over-smoothing and blurring effect. SCFPM method introduce least new artifact.

# Synthetic MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI combined with diffusion-weighted imaging for identifying molecular subtypes of breast cancer using machine learning models

## 合成MRI、动态增强MRI联合扩散加权成像识别乳腺癌分子亚型的机器学习模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5608203/latest

Objective: To determine whether quantitative parameters from synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can effectively differentiate between molecular subtypes of breast cancer using various machine learning models.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 401 patients with suspicious breast lesions who underwent breast MRI examinations, including SyMRI, DCE-MRI, and DWI, from September 2020 to September 2024. Quantitative parameters obtained from SyMRI included T1-Pre, T2-Pre, and proton density (PD-Pre) values of breast lesions before contrast injection, as well as T1-Gd, T2-Gd, and PD-Gd values after contrast injection. Additionally, difference values (Delta-T1, Delta-T2, Delta-PD) and enhancement ratios (T1-Ratio, T2-Ratio, PD-Ratio) were calculated. Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated the morphological and kinetic characteristics on DCE-MRI, using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the lesions to assess tumors on DWI. Logistic regression and ANOVA were applied to identify significant parameter differences among the four breast cancer subtypes. Based on these selected parameters by logistic regression, five machine learning models were developed: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT). We plotted Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary metric to assess the performance of the best model. We utilized the SHAP library in Python to generate feature importance values for our model's predictions.
Results: A total of 292 patients (median age, 53 years; age range, 27&ndash;80 years) met the inclusion criteria. Among these, 204 patients (median age, 52 years; age range, 27&ndash;78 years) were assigned to the training cohort, while 88 patients (median age, 53 years; age range, 27&ndash;80 years) were included in the testing cohort. Eleven parameters were identified across the four breast cancer subtypes(p＜0.05). These parameters included two clinical pathological factors: age and menopause(p＜0.001); five SyMRI parameters: T1-Gd, T2-Gd, PD-Gd, T1-Ratio, and PD-Ratio(p＜0.05); three DCE-MRI parameters: burr sign, time&ndash;intensity curve (TIC), and Breast Imaging Reporting and Date System(BI-RADS) grading(p＜0.001); and one DWI parameter: ADC-Tumor(p＜0.001). The SVM model demonstrated the highest overall performance based on the comprehensive evaluation of multiple metrics in the training set, achieving superior diagnostic performance with AUC, accuracy, speciﬁcity, and sensitivity of 0.972, 82.5%, 94.76%, and 82.14%, respectively. This SVM model achieved AUC values of 0.979 for luminal A, 0.925 for luminal B, 0.971 for HER2-enriched, and 0.982 for triple-negative (TN) subtypes in the training set; AUC values of 0.973 for luminal A, 0.873 for luminal B, 0.956 for HER2-enriched, and 0.955 for TN subtypes in the testing set. The Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) tool to effectively identify the importance of features contributing to the model, with T2-Gd, PD-Ratio, and burr sign showing the highest contributions, achieving mean absolute SHAP values of 0.418, 0.340, and 0.264, respectively.
Conclusion: &amp;nbsp;Quantitative parameters derived from SyMRI mappings, DCE-MRI, and DWI may provide a non-invasive approach for differentiating between the molecular subtypes of breast cancer using various machine learning models.

# Satisfaction survey of early clinical exposure in medical students: a cross-sectional study

## 医学生临床早期暴露满意度调查的横断面研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5677524/latest

Introduction: Early clinical exposure (ECE), one type of vertical integration model between preclinical and clinical subjects, is a teaching-learning technique that improves early medical students' professionalism. Conventional medical training delays clinical exposure until later years, potentially diminishing students' motivation and confidence. This study aims to evaluate the satisfaction and perception of third-year medical students from the ECE program.
Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted involving a convenience sample of 93 third-year medical students participating in an ECE program from December to March 2023 in the emergency ward. Data were collected using a validated semi-structured questionnaire, administered immediately after the program and three months later, after the students officially entered the clinical setting. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to assess students' satisfaction and perceptions.
Results: Out of 93 participants, 80 completed the questionnaire. Most of the students found ECE to be an effective program with a satisfaction rate of over 90% in terms of benefits for the clinical years, helping to adapt to the clinical environment, giving confidence to communicate with supervisors and patients, and taking medical history and physical examination individually or in groups of two or more people. However, results show a significant decrease in the attitude towards the ECE program after entering the hospital (P value = 0.001). Qualitative feedback highlighted the effectiveness of ECE in helping students adapt to the clinical environment, the need for prolonged interaction with supervisors, and the integration of ECE across all courses.
Discussion: The ECE program significantly improved students' initial confidence and adaptability to clinical environments. However, the observed decline in long-term satisfaction suggests a gap between the structured ECE experience and the complexities of real clinical practice. Continuous adaptation and integration of ECE throughout medical training are essential to sustain students' motivation and confidence as they transition to clinical roles.

Background: Faculty Development Programs (FDPs) are an integral part of institutional priorities to support staff members in leveraging the skills necessary to deliver quality education and enhance the overall learning experience. Little is known about their impact in resource-limited settings. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the perception of medical and health faculties toward FDP by exploring staffs&rsquo; views on their performance, learning environment, and challenges that hinder the program&rsquo;s implementation.
Method: Data were collected through a survey of faculty members to assess participants&rsquo; perceptions of the CPD programs
Result:There was a 77% response rate (n=103) to the survey from the targeted sample size of 134. . The majority of the staff members (90.3%, n = 93) perceive FDP activities as beneficial for enhancing their teaching abilities, while 70.9% (n = 73) see improvement in research practices, and 54.4% (n = 56) observe benefits to their clinical skills. Fewer respondents (46.6%, n = 48) reported improvements in their scientific publications. However, several challenges were identified with time constraints perceived as a major obstacle to effective program implementation.
Conclusion:In a resource-limited setting, evaluating the program's effectiveness plays a pivotal role in improving its activities. Providing additional resources, enhancing institutional support, and improving accessibility to activities can strengthen the program&rsquo;s success, ultimately benefiting both staff and students.

## 基于机器学习技术的社区慢性阻塞性肺疾病患者抑郁风险预测模型的建立与验证

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5651501/latest

Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory condition that presents a significant health challenge. Research suggests that individuals with COPD frequently experience symptoms of depression. Despite this association, there is a marked lack of reliable predictive models that can accurately forecast the likelihood of depression in community-dwelling COPD patients. This study aims to develop an innovative predictive model utilizing machine learning techniques to effectively anticipate the risk of depression in individuals with COPD living in the community.
Methods: The research utilized data from the 2020 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) database to examine clinical information from a sample of 809 COPD patients residing in the community. The analysis involved the application of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression to identify predictive factors. Furthermore, various machine learning (ML) classification models were employed, with the most optimal model being determined and assessed. Additionally, a personalized risk assessment tool using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was developed for interpreting the findings.
Result: The study identified six key indicators of depression in community-based COPD patients. These included Self_assessed_health, Sleeping_time_at_night, Memory_disease, Gender, ADL_ score, and Age. Logistic classification model was the optimal model, test set area under curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval, CI):0.713 (0.648-0.778).
Conclusions:The model constructed in this study has relatively reliable predictive performance, which helps clinical doctors identify high-risk populations of community COPD patients prone to depression at an early stage.

Objectives: Studies on predicting the outcome of sling surgery are limited. Most depend on analysis of multiple confounding factors using regression models. However, their prediction results are limited. In this study, we tested a statistical regression model and an AI model for the prediction of the outcome of mid-urethral sling.
Methods: Data were collected from 151 patients who underwent MUS surgery in our center from 2002 to 2022 and confounding factors that affect the outcome of the surgery at a minimum of one year. The study was divided into two phases. Phase I included the construction of a prediction model using binomial logistic regression. In phase II, we applied an AI preferences (Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial neural network (ANN) trying to obtain better predictions.
Results: Phase I: The logistic regression model predicted the outcome of surgery with overall accuracy of 90.7% and positive predictive value of 61.5% [X2 (11) = 46.24, P &amp;lt; 0.001].
Phase II: The data of the patients were entered as 10 features; 9 were predictors and the 10th was the output. The output comprised 18 cases designated as &lsquo;failure&rsquo; and 133 as &lsquo;success&rsquo; output. The best model performance-wise was the (SVM) with 92% accuracy and 96% F1-score, which meets the industrial standards for predictive models. However, ANN produced 90% accuracy and 94% F1-score. However, our sample size is small
Conclusion: Prediction of the outcome of MUS surgery was achieved using different modalities with the best prediction of the outcome obtained by SVM method.

# The ART of BARD: The Role of Domain Selection and the Background Field on Atmospheric River Tracking (ART) of BARD over the pan-Atlantic

## 吟游诗人的艺术: 域选择和背景场在泛大西洋上的吟游诗人的大气河流追踪 (ART) 中的作用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5710901/latest

Over the past decade, the number of methods for Atmospheric River (AR) detection has increased, highlighting the growing understanding that uncertainty in detection may affect scientific knowledge. This study evaluates and validates the regional scale implementation of Bayesian AR Detector (BARD), a statistical machine learning model developed to reduce the uncertainty in AR tracking (ART), using three different horizontal and vertical domains of background integrated water-vapour transport (IVT) field and focusing on the pan-Atlantic region during 1940-2022 using ERA5 data. The consistency in seasonal AR Probability (ARP) and IVT differences across 3 model runs indicates that all configurations capture the general seasonal cycle of ARs, with enhanced activity and moisture transport in the midlatitudes during winter. However, discrepancies in selected IVT backgrounds and domains led to anomalies&rsquo; magnitude and spatial distribution, particularly in AR detection probability and AR IVT over Western and Northern Europe. These discrepancies among model runs are large over the ocean where ARs take shape and are consistent in climate modes such as a strong positive El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO+) of 2015-2016. This reflects the robust and inherent differences in how each configuration maps AR dimensions and their associated transport processes. Further, these biases in AR mapping across model runs led to higher differences in AR-induced precipitation, wind speed, and temperature in Northern Europe and Scandinavia. This comparison underscores the importance of evaluating model configurations to assess uncertainties in AR representation under varying IVT background fields across regional domains and climate conditions.
