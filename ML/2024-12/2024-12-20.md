# Maven: a multimodal foundation model for supernova science

## Maven: 超新星科学的多模态基础模型

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad990d

**Authors:** Gemma Zhang, Thomas Helfer, Alexander T Gagliano, Siddharth Mishra-Sharma and V Ashley Villar

A common setting in astronomy is the availability of a small number of high-quality observations, and larger amounts of either lower-quality observations or synthetic data from simplified models. Time-domain astrophysics is a canonical example of this imbalance, with the number of supernovae observed photometrically outpacing the number observed spectroscopically by multiple orders of magnitude. At the same time, no data-driven models exist to understand these photometric and spectroscopic observables in a common context. Contrastive learning objectives, which have grown in popularity for aligning distinct data modalities in a shared embedding space, provide a potential solution to extract information from these modalities. We present Maven, the first foundation model for supernova science. To construct Maven, we first pre-train our model to align photometry and spectroscopy from 0.5 M synthetic supernovae using a contrastive objective. We then fine-tune the model on 4702 observed supernovae from the Zwicky transient facility. Maven reaches state-of-the-art performance on both classification and redshift estimation, despite the embeddings not being explicitly optimized for these tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that pre-training with synthetic data improves overall performance. In the upcoming era of the Vera C. Rubin observatory, Maven will serve as a valuable tool for leveraging large, unlabeled and multimodal time-domain datasets.

# Scaling field-theoretic simulation for multi-component mixtures with neural operators

**Authors:** Emmit K. Pert, Clay H. Batton, Sherry Li, Steven Dunne, Grant M. Rotskoff

arXiv:2412.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-component polymer mixtures are ubiquitous in biological self-organization but are notoriously difficult to study computationally. Plagued by both slow single molecule relaxation times and slow equilibration within dense mixtures, molecular dynamics simulations are typically infeasible at the spatial scales required to study the stability of mesophase structure. Polymer field theories offer an attractive alternative, but analytical calculations are only tractable for mean-field theories and nearby perturbations, constraints that become especially problematic for fluctuation-induced effects such as coacervation. Here, we show that a recently developed technique for obtaining numerical solutions to partial differential equations based on operator learning, *neural operators*, lends itself to a highly scalable training strategy by parallelizing per-species operator maps. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach on six-component mixtures with randomly selected compositions and that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art pseudospectral integrators for field-theoretic simulations, especially as polymer lengths become long.

**Authors:** Nic\'ephore Bonnet, Nicola Marzari

arXiv:2412.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first-principles approach for calculating ion separation in solution through two-dimensional (2D) membranes is proposed and applied. Ionic energy profiles across the membrane are obtained first, where solvation effects are simulated explicitly with machine-learning molecular dynamics, electrostatic corrections are applied to remove finite-size capacitive effects, and a mean-field treatment of the charging of the electrochemical double layer is used. Entropic contributions are assessed analytically and validated against thermodynamic integration. Ionic separations are then inferred through a microkinetic model of the filtration process, accounting for steady-state charge separation effects across the membrane. The approach is applied to Li$^{+}$, Na$^{+}$, K$^{+}$ sieving through a crown-ether functionalized graphene membrane, with a case study of the mechanisms for a highly selective and efficient extraction of lithium from aqueous solutions.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of artificial neural networks that are implemented in a physical system. A major challenge in this context is that these networks are difficult to train since training here would require a change of physical parameters rather than simply of coefficients in a computer program. For this reason, reservoir computing, where one employs high-dimensional recurrent networks and trains only the final layer, is widely used in this context. In this chapter, I introduce the basic concepts of reservoir computing. Moreover, I present some important physical implementations coming from electronics, photonics, spintronics, mechanics, and biology. Finally, I provide a brief discussion of quantum reservoir computing.

Abstract: Ordered phases of matter have close connections to computation. Two prominent examples are spin glass order, with wide-ranging applications in machine learning and optimization, and topological order, closely related to quantum error correction. Here, we introduce the concept of topological quantum spin glass (TQSG) order which marries these two notions, exhibiting both the complex energy landscapes of spin glasses, and the quantum memory and long-range entanglement characteristic of topologically ordered systems. Using techniques from coding theory and a quantum generalization of Gibbs state decompositions, we show that TQSG order is the low-temperature phase of various quantum LDPC codes on expander graphs, including hypergraph and balanced product codes. Our work introduces a topological analog of spin glasses that preserves quantum information, opening new avenues for both statistical mechanics and quantum computer science.

Abstract: The brain encodes external stimuli through patterns of neural activity, forming internal representations of the world. Recent experiments show that neural representations for a given stimulus change over time. However, the mechanistic origin for the observed "representational drift" (RD) remains unclear. Here, we propose a biologically-realistic computational model of the piriform cortex to study RD in the mammalian olfactory system by combining two mechanisms for the dynamics of synaptic weights at two separate timescales: spontaneous fluctuations on a scale of days and spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) on a scale of seconds. Our study shows that, while spontaneous fluctuations in synaptic weights induce RD, STDP-based learning during repeated stimulus presentations can reduce it. Our model quantitatively explains recent experiments on RD in the olfactory system and offers a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of drift and its relation to learning, which may be useful to study RD in other brain regions.

Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of novel thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can easily be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. Finally, we propose new promising candidate materials such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.

arXiv:2412.14109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been extensively employed in planar perovskite photovoltaics to screen effective organic molecular additives, while encountering predictive biases for novel materials due to small datasets and reliance on predefined descriptors. Present work thus proposes an effective approach, Co-Pilot for Perovskite Additive Screener (Co-PAS), an ML-driven framework designed to accelerate additive screening for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Co-PAS overcomes predictive biases by integrating the Molecular Scaffold Classifier (MSC) for scaffold-based pre-screening and utilizing Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (JTVAE) latent vectors to enhance molecular structure representation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of power conversion efficiency (PCE) predictions. Leveraging Co-PAS, we integrate domain knowledge to screen an extensive dataset of 250,000 molecules from PubChem, prioritizing candidates based on predicted PCE values and key molecular properties such as donor number, dipole moment, and hydrogen bond acceptor count. This workflow leads to the identification of several promising passivating molecules, including the novel Boc-L-threonine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (BTN), which, to our knowledge, has not been explored as an additive in PSCs and achieves a device PCE of 25.20%. Our results underscore the potential of Co-PAS in advancing additive discovery for high-performance PSCs.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the update of weight matrices in learning algorithms can be described in the framework of Dyson Brownian motion, thereby inheriting many features of random matrix theory. We relate the level of stochasticity to the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, providing more robust evidence to a previously conjectured scaling relationship. We discuss universal and non-universal features in the resulting Coulomb gas distribution and identify the Wigner surmise and Wigner semicircle explicitly in a teacher-student model and in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine.

**Authors:** Myeong-Su Lee, Jaemin Oh, Dong-Chan Lee, KangWook Lee, Sooncheol Park, Youngjoon Hong

arXiv:2412.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenges posed by the high nonlinearity of the Butler-Volmer (BV) equation in forward and inverse simulations of the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model using the physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework. The BV equation presents significant challenges for PINNs, primarily due to the hyperbolic sine term, which renders the Hessian of the PINN loss function highly ill-conditioned. To address this issue, we introduce a bypassing term that improves numerical stability by substantially reducing the condition number of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the small magnitude of the ionic flux \( j \) often leads to a common failure mode where PINNs converge to incorrect solutions. We demonstrate that incorporating a secondary conservation law for the solid-phase potential \( \psi \) effectively prevents such convergence issues and ensures solution accuracy. The proposed methods prove effective for solving both forward and inverse problems involving the BV equation. Specifically, we achieve precise parameter estimation in inverse scenarios and reliable solution predictions for forward simulations.

arXiv:2412.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in data assimilation (DA) methods have greatly improved the accuracy of Earth system predictions. To fuse multi-source data and reconstruct the nonlinear evolution missing from observations, geoscientists are developing future-oriented DA methods. In this paper, we redesign a purely data-driven latent space DA framework (DeepDA) that employs a generative artificial intelligence model to capture the nonlinear evolution in sea surface temperature. Under variational constraints, DeepDA embedded with nonlinear features can effectively fuse heterogeneous data. The results show that DeepDA remains highly stable in capturing and generating nonlinear evolutions even when a large amount of observational information is missing. It can be found that when only 10% of the observation information is available, the error increase of DeepDA does not exceed 40%. Furthermore, DeepDA has been shown to be robust in the fusion of real observations and ensemble simulations. In particular, this paper provides a mechanism analysis of the nonlinear evolution generated by DeepDA from the perspective of physical patterns, which reveals the inherent explainability of our DL model in capturing multi-scale ocean signals.

arXiv:2412.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tearing mode, a large-scale MHD instability in tokamak, typically disrupts the equilibrium magnetic surfaces, leads to the formation of magnetic islands, and reduces core electron temperature and density, thus resulting in significant energy losses and may even cause discharge termination. This process is unacceptable for ITER. Therefore, the accurate identification of a magnetic island in real time is crucial for the effective control of the tearing mode in ITER in the future. In this study, based on the characteristics induced by tearing modes, an attention-aware convolutional neural network (AM-CNN) is proposed to identify the presence of magnetic islands in tearing mode discharge utilizing the data from ECE diagnostics in the EAST tokamak. A total of 11 ECE channels covering the range of core is used in the tearing mode dataset, which includes 2.5*10^9 data collected from 68 shots from 2016 to 2021 years. We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (66.5%, 5.7%, and 27.8%), respectively. An attention mechanism is designed to couple with the convolutional neural networks to improve the capability of feature extraction of signals. During the model training process, we utilized adaptive learning rate adjustment and early stopping mechanisms to optimize performance of AM-CNN. The model results show that a classification accuracy of 91.96% is achieved in tearing mode identification. Compared to CNN without AM, the attention-aware convolutional neural networks demonstrate great performance across accuracy, recall metrics, and F1 score. By leveraging the deep learning model, which incorporates a physical understanding of the tearing process to identify tearing mode behaviors, the combination of physical mechanisms and deep learning is emphasized, significantly laying an important foundation for the future intelligent control of tearing mode dynamics.

arXiv:2412.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiplexing capability of metasurfaces has been successfully demonstrated in applications such as holography and diffractive neural networks. However, identifying a suitable structure that simultaneously satisfies the phase requirements across multiple channels remains a significant challenge in many multiplexing design scenarios. In this study, we propose an innovative phase correlation method for metasurface multiplexing design that utilizes a multi-layer perceptron to establish phase correlations across multiple channels. This approach reduces the difficulty of multi-channel phase training by converting it into a simpler single-channel optimization task, thereby reducing design complexity and computational cost. Using the proposed method, we design a dual-wavelength multiplexed diffractive neural network and a multi-wavelength metasurface color holography under a linear polarization. The designed multiplexed metasurface achieves up to 90% classification accuracy in image recognition and exhibits good performance in color holography.

# Optimal Spatiotemporal Resolutions

**Authors:** Domiziano Doria, Simone Martino, Matteo Becchi, Giovanni M. Pavan

arXiv:2412.13741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, the comprehension of any type of complex system depends on the resolution used to look at the phenomena occurring within it.But identifying a priori, for example, the best time frequencies/scales to study a certain system over-time, or the spatial distances at which looking for correlations, symmetries, and fluctuations, is most often non-trivial.Here we describe an unsupervised approach that, starting solely from the data of a system, allows learning the characteristic length-scales of the key events/processes dominating it and the optimal spatiotemporal resolutions to characterize them.We test this approach on time-series data obtained from simulation or experimental trajectories of various example many-body complex systems ranging from the atomic- to the macroscopic-scale and having diverse internal dynamic complexities.Our method automatically performs the analysis of the system's data, analyzing correlations at all relevant inter-particle distances and at all possible inter-frame intervals in which their time-series can be subdivided: namely, at all space-and-time resolutions.The optimal spatiotemporal resolution for studying a certain system thus steps-out as that maximizing information extraction-and-classification from the system's data, which we prove being related to the characteristic spatiotemporal length-scales of the local/collective physical events dominating it.This approach is broadly applicable and can be used to optimize the study of different types of data (static distributions, time-series, or signals).The concept of 'optimal resolution' has general character and provides a robust basis to characterize any type of system based on its data, as well as to guide data analysis in general.

arXiv:2412.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of high-performance computing has enabled the generation of large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of turbulent flows, driving the need for efficient compression/decompression techniques that reduce storage demands while maintaining fidelity. Traditional methods, such as the discrete wavelet transform, cannot achieve compression ratios of 8 or higher for complex turbulent flows without introducing significant encoding/decoding errors. On the other hand, super-resolution generative adversarial networks (SR-GANs) can accurately reconstruct fine-scale features, preserving velocity gradients and structural details, even at a compression ratio of 512, thanks to the adversarial training enabled by the discriminator. Their high training time is significantly reduced with a progressive transfer learning approach and, once trained, they can be applied independently of the Reynolds number. It is demonstrated that SR-GANs can enhance dataset temporal resolution without additional simulation overhead by generating high-quality intermediate fields from compressed snapshots. The SR-GAN discriminator can reliably evaluate the quality of decoded fields, ensuring fidelity even in the absence of original DNS fields. Hence, SR-GAN-based compression/decompression methods present a highly efficient and scalable alternative for large-scale DNS storage and transfer, offering substantial advantages in terms of compression efficiency, reconstruction fidelity, and temporal resolution enhancement.

# Harvesting energy from turbulent winds with Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Lorenzo Basile, Maria Grazia Berni, Antonio Celani

arXiv:2412.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an emerging technology designed to harness the power of high-altitude winds, offering a solution to several limitations of conventional wind turbines. AWE is based on flying devices (usually gliders or kites) that, tethered to a ground station and driven by the wind, convert its mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of a generator. Such systems are usually controlled by manoeuvering the kite so as to follow a predefined path prescribed by optimal control techniques, such as model-predictive control. These methods are strongly dependent on the specific model at use and difficult to generalize, especially in unpredictable conditions such as the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. Our aim is to explore the possibility of replacing these techniques with an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional methods, RL does not require a predefined model, making it robust to variability and uncertainty. Our experimental results in complex simulated environments demonstrate that AWE agents trained with RL can effectively extract energy from turbulent flows, relying on minimal local information about the kite orientation and speed relative to the wind.

Abstract: Urban pollution poses serious health risks, particularly in relation to traffic-related air pollution, which remains a major concern in many cities. Vehicle emissions contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular issues, especially for vulnerable and exposed road users like pedestrians and cyclists. Therefore, accurate air quality monitoring with high spatial resolution is vital for good urban environmental management. This study aims to provide insights for processing spatiotemporal datasets with high missing data rates. In this study, the challenge of high missing data rates is a result of the limited data available and the fine granularity required for precise classification of PM2.5 levels. The data used for analysis and imputation were collected from both mobile sensors and fixed stations by Dynamic Parcel Distribution, the Environmental Protection Agency, and Google in Dublin, Ireland, where the missing data rate was approximately 82.42%, making accurate Particulate Matter 2.5 level predictions particularly difficult. Various imputation and prediction approaches were evaluated and compared, including ensemble methods, deep learning models, and diffusion models. External features such as traffic flow, weather conditions, and data from the nearest stations were incorporated to enhance model performance. The results indicate that diffusion methods with external features achieved the highest F1 score, reaching 0.9486 (Accuracy: 94.26%, Precision: 94.42%, Recall: 94.82%), with ensemble models achieving the highest accuracy of 94.82%, illustrating that good performance can be obtained despite a high missing data rate.

Abstract: Large-scale crises, including wars and pandemics, have repeatedly shaped human history, and their simultaneous occurrence presents profound challenges to societies. Understanding the dynamics of epidemic spread during warfare is essential for developing effective containment strategies in complex conflict zones. While research has explored epidemic models in various settings, the impact of warfare on epidemic dynamics remains underexplored. In this study, we proposed a novel mathematical model that integrates the epidemiological SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with the war dynamics Lanchester model to explore the dual influence of war and pandemic on a population's mortality. Moreover, we consider a dual-use military and civil healthcare system that aims to reduce the overall mortality rate which can use different administration policies. Using an agent-based simulation to generate in silico data, we trained a deep reinforcement learning model for healthcare administration policy and conducted an intensive investigation on its performance. Our results show that a pandemic during war conduces chaotic dynamics where the healthcare system should either prioritize war-injured soldiers or pandemic-infected civilians based on the immediate amount of mortality from each option, ignoring long-term objectives. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating conflict-related factors into epidemic modeling to enhance preparedness and response strategies in conflict-affected areas.

# Machine Learning Co-pilot for Screening of Organic Molecular Additives for Perovskite Solar Cells

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been extensively employed in planar perovskite photovoltaics to screen effective organic molecular additives, while encountering predictive biases for novel materials due to small datasets and reliance on predefined descriptors. Present work thus proposes an effective approach, Co-Pilot for Perovskite Additive Screener (Co-PAS), an ML-driven framework designed to accelerate additive screening for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Co-PAS overcomes predictive biases by integrating the Molecular Scaffold Classifier (MSC) for scaffold-based pre-screening and utilizing Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (JTVAE) latent vectors to enhance molecular structure representation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of power conversion efficiency (PCE) predictions. Leveraging Co-PAS, we integrate domain knowledge to screen an extensive dataset of 250,000 molecules from PubChem, prioritizing candidates based on predicted PCE values and key molecular properties such as donor number, dipole moment, and hydrogen bond acceptor count. This workflow leads to the identification of several promising passivating molecules, including the novel Boc-L-threonine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (BTN), which, to our knowledge, has not been explored as an additive in PSCs and achieves a device PCE of 25.20%. Our results underscore the potential of Co-PAS in advancing additive discovery for high-performance PSCs.

# Navigating the Noise: Bringing Clarity to ML Parameterization Design with O(100) Ensembles

Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) parameterizations of subgrid processes (here of turbulence, convection, and radiation) may one day replace conventional parameterizations by emulating high-resolution physics without the cost of explicit simulation. However, uncertainty about the relationship between offline and online performance (i.e., when integrated with a large-scale general circulation model (GCM)) hinders their development. Much of this uncertainty stems from limited sampling of the noisy, emergent effects of upstream ML design decisions on downstream online hybrid simulation. Our work rectifies the sampling issue via the construction of a semi-automated, end-to-end pipeline for $\mathcal{O}(100)$ size ensembles of hybrid simulations, revealing important nuances in how systematic reductions in offline error manifest in changes to online error and online stability. For example, removing dropout and switching from a Mean Squared Error (MSE) to a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss both reduce offline error, but they have opposite effects on online error and online stability. Other design decisions, like incorporating memory, converting moisture input from specific humidity to relative humidity, using batch normalization, and training on multiple climates do not come with any such compromises. Finally, we show that ensemble sizes of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ may be necessary to reliably detect causally relevant differences online. By enabling rapid online experimentation at scale, we can empirically settle debates regarding subgrid ML parameterization design that would have otherwise remained unresolved in the noise.

Abstract: A novel method to reconstruct the energy of hadronic showers in the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) is presented. The HGCAL is a sampling calorimeter with very fine transverse and longitudinal granularity. The active media are silicon sensors and scintillator tiles readout by SiPMs and the absorbers are a combination of lead and Cu/CuW in the electromagnetic section, and steel in the hadronic section. The shower reconstruction method is based on graph neural networks and it makes use of a dynamic reduction network architecture. It is shown that the algorithm is able to capture and mitigate the main effects that normally hinder the reconstruction of hadronic showers using classical reconstruction methods, by compensating for fluctuations in the multiplicity, energy, and spatial distributions of the shower's constituents. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using test beam data collected in 2018 prototype of the CMS HGCAL accompanied by a section of the CALICE AHCAL prototype. The capability of the method to mitigate the impact of energy leakage from the calorimeter is also demonstrated.

Abstract: Background: Limited-angle (LA) dual-energy (DE) cone-beam CT (CBCT) is considered as a potential solution to achieve fast and low-dose DE imaging on current CBCT scanners without hardware modification. However, its clinical implementations are hindered by the challenging image reconstruction from LA projections. While optimization-based and deep learning-based methods have been proposed for image reconstruction, their utilization is limited by the requirement for X-ray spectra measurement or paired datasets for model training.
  Purpose: This work aims to facilitate the clinical applications of fast and low-dose DECBCT by developing a practical solution for image reconstruction in LA-DECBCT.
  Methods: An inter-spectral structural similarity-based regularization was integrated into the iterative image reconstruction in LA-DECBCT. By enforcing the similarity between the DE images, LA artifacts were efficiently reduced in the reconstructed DECBCT images. The proposed method was evaluated using four physical phantoms and three digital phantoms, demonstrating its efficacy in quantitative DECBCT imaging.
  Conclusions: The proposed method achieves accurate image reconstruction without the need for X-ray spectra measurement for optimization or paired datasets for model training, showing great practical value in clinical implementations of LA-DECBCT.

arXiv:2407.11284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconvolving ("unfolding'') detector distortions is a critical step in the comparison of cross section measurements with theoretical predictions in particle and nuclear physics. However, most existing approaches require histogram binning while many theoretical predictions are at the level of statistical moments. We develop a new approach to directly unfold distribution moments as a function of another observable without having to first discretize the data. Our Moment Unfolding technique uses machine learning and is inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We demonstrate the performance of this approach using jet substructure measurements in collider physics. With this illustrative example, we find that our Moment Unfolding protocol is more precise than bin-based approaches and is as or more precise than completely unbinned methods.

Abstract: High-resolution spatiotemporal simulations effectively capture the complexities of atmospheric plume dispersion in complex terrain. However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for applications requiring rapid responses or iterative processes, such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, or inverse modeling. To address this challenge, this work introduces the Dual-Stage Temporal Three-dimensional UNet Super-resolution (DST3D-UNet-SR) model, a highly efficient deep learning model for plume dispersion prediction. DST3D-UNet-SR is composed of two sequential modules: the temporal module (TM), which predicts the transient evolution of a plume in complex terrain from low-resolution temporal data, and the spatial refinement module (SRM), which subsequently enhances the spatial resolution of the TM predictions. We train DST3DUNet- SR using a comprehensive dataset derived from high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of plume transport. We propose the DST3D-UNet-SR model to significantly accelerate LES simulations of three-dimensional plume dispersion by three orders of magnitude. Additionally, the model demonstrates the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving conditions through the incorporation of new observational data, substantially improving prediction accuracy in high-concentration regions near the source.

# Machine Learning in X-ray Scattering for Materials Discovery and Characterization

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-x8fx0-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Nazanin, Bassiri-Gharb

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an immediate and powerful characterization technique that provides detailed information on the lattice structure and long-range order in crystalline materials. In recent decades, the quality and quantity of available crystal structure data has exploded, in large part due to the advent of online crystal structure databases, increased use of in-situ and operando methodologies, and user-accessible beamlines. The new wealth of data has also spawned an increasing use of machine learning (ML) to either construct high-throughput surrogates of established analysis or extract patterns from large datasets. However, XRD spectroscopy has been for many years solved via Rietveld refinement, while most ML techniques are simply complex statistical evaluation methods that are physics-agnostic. The discrepancy between data analysis and the underlying physics can lead to incorrect conclusions and/or limit the wide-spread adoption of ML techniques. In this review, we bridge the gap between ML and XRD spectroscopy with an introduction designed both for new data scientists and experimentalists interested in problems related to ML-guided spectroscopy analysis. We cover how supervised ML methods are used to predict likely symmetries and phases in pure and mixed samples, including challenges related to experimental artifacts and model interpretation. We also review recent uses of unsupervised methods in the extraction of patterns hidden in high-dimensional data, such as in in-situ and microscopic studies. Finally, we discuss the importance of problem formulation, data transferability, and reporting with recent case studies and give various resources throughout to expedite the learning curve for readers new to XRD or ML. We advocate for greater scrutiny of ML methods, how they are presented in the literature, and how to conduct data-driven research responsibly.

# Object Detection: A comprehensive study of famous Deep Learning approaches with case study of Helmet Detection dataset

## 目标检测: 以头盔检测数据集为例对著名深度学习方法的综合研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5465187/latest

A key component of computer vision, object detection is essential to many applications, including augmented reality, autonomous driving, and monitoring. With a succinct case study on helmet detection, this paper explores the most recent deep learning architectures for object detection. Using a variety of datasets, the study carefully assesses the performance of well-known models such as YOLO, SSD, and R-CNN. Our findings shed light on the advantages and disadvantages of each method for object detection in various settings and scales through thorough investigation and analysis. This research advances the field's understanding and capabilities by highlighting the wider ramifications of object detection in real-world circumstances. Our findings highlight the need of reliable object detection systems and provide insightful information for further studies targeted at developing more efficient and accurate models. The case study on helmet detection illustrates how object detection can be applied to ensure safety compliance, particularly in construction and traffic surveillance. We found that YOLO outperformed other models in real-time detection due to its speed, while SSD provided a good balance between accuracy and performance. R-CNN, though highly accurate, was slower and more computationally expensive. Our results suggest that the choice of model depends heavily on the specific application requirements, such as the need for real-time processing or high precision. Future work should focus on optimizing these models for edge devices and improving their robustness in diverse environmental conditions, further enhancing their practical utility in real-world applications.

Rapid extraction and visualization of cell-specific gene expression is important for automatic cell type annotation, e.g. in single cell analysis. There is an emerging field in which tools such as curated databases or Machine Learning methods are used to support cell type annotation. However, complementing approaches to efficiently incorporate latest knowledge of free-text articles from literature databases, such as PubMed are understudied.This work introduces the PubMed Gene/Cell type-Relation Atlas (PuMA) which provides a local, easy-to-use web-interface to facilitate automatic cell type annotation. It utilizes a pretrained large language model in order to extract gene and cell type concepts from PubMed and links biomedical ontologies to suggest gene to cell type relations. It includes a search tool for genes and cells, additionally providing an interactive graph visualization for exploring cross-relations. Each result is fully traceable by linking the relevant PubMed articles. This work enables researchers to analyse and automatize cell type annotation based on PubMed articles.

# Scalable Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale Coordination of Electric Vehicles Using Graph Neural Networks

## 基于图神经网络的电动汽车大规模协调可扩展强化学习

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5504138/latest

As the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) accelerates, addressing the challenges of large-scale, city-wide optimization becomes critical to ensuring efficient use of charging infrastructure and maintaining electrical grid stability. This study introduces EV-GNN, a novel graph-based solution that addresses scalability challenges and captures uncertainties in EV behavior from a Charging Point Operator's (CPO) perspective. We prove that EV-GNN enhances classic RL algorithms' scalability and sample efficiency by combining an end-to-end Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture with Reinforcement Learning (RL) and employing a branch pruning technique. We further demonstrate that the proposed architecture's flexibility allows it to be combined with most state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms to solve a wide range of problems, including those with continuous, multi-discrete, and discrete action spaces. Extensive experimental evaluations show that EV-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL algorithms in scalability and generalization across diverse EV charging scenarios, delivering notable improvements in both small- and large-scale problems.

# Development of Emotion Recognition for Rehabilitation Feedback System Using Wavelet Transform and LSTM

## 基于小波变换和LSTM的康复反馈系统情感识别开发

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5561710/latest

Human assist devices have been used to assist users in rehabilitation environments to correct patients' motions to increase the rehabilitation quality. However, they are usually a routing working machine that cannot consider the patient's emotions. By introducing emotion recognition into the system, the device can detect the user's condition more accurately and provide a corresponding action to improve the experience. This study focuses on enhancing the precision of emotion recognition for a rehabilitation device designed for stroke patients, which will adjust according to their emotional state to improve their rehabilitation experience. In this study, the Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP) is leveraged, which includes multimodal physiological signals and subjective emotion ratings from 32 participants watching 40 emotion-evoking video clips that is suitable for neural network training. Two preprocessing methods, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Transform (WT), are considered for utilizing the dataset. Additionally, DNN, DenseNet, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are considered the core of the classification method, which will determine the emotion into 3, 5, or 9 categories. The result indicates that STFT and WT preserve temporal and frequency information that can benefit the classification. Among the models, LSTM demonstrates superior capability in capturing sequential data features from EEG signals, leading to higher accuracy rates. Throughout experiments, the best performance was achieved with the LSTM network processed with WT, with accuracies of 88% for valence and 90% for arousal in 3x3 classification, which is better than the previous system. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of choosing appropriate signal processing techniques and neural network architectures to enhance the precision and reliability of emotion recognition systems using EEG data. It can be further applied to detect patients' conditions to provide a better rehabilitation experience for stroke patients.

This process is essential for improving the accuracy of image analysis, enhancing image recognition, and optimizing visual effects. Despite the widespread application and notable success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image denoising tasks, existing methods often encounter challenges such as overfitting and limited flexibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Dual-Branch Denoising Network (DFFNet) designed to enhance feature extraction capabilities and improve adaptability to noise. Specifically, the proposed DFFNet comprises two distinct parallel branches. In the first branch, a novel Multi-Scale Convolutional Block (MCB) is introduced, which significantly increases the receptive field while simultaneously preserving local details and the overall structure of the image. In the second branch, a Flexible Pooling Attention mechanism (FCA) is designed to reduce computational complexity while enhancing the effectiveness of feature representation. The two branches are then weighted and fused, achieving the dual objectives of noise removal and the preservation of critical image details, thereby improving overall image quality. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed DFFNet achieves superior denoising performance.

# Interpreting DETR with Respect to Object Queries

## 解释关于对象查询的DETR

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5659752/latest

In recent years, understanding the decision-making processes of neural network models has become increasingly important. This paper is focusing on this concern and addresses this issue on DETR model which is an object detection framework based on transformers. We explore ways to improve the interpretability and efficiency of this model by proposing and applying new methods for representing this model. A key focus of this research is on object queries specifically analyzing their behavior during the model's validation process. We identify and remove less active object queries from the model, subsequently, measuring the impact on the training time and also the model accuracy. By eliminating 10% of these inactive object queries, we reduce validation time by 3.3% and lower the model&amp;rsquo;s required FLOPS by 36.25 G.

# Prefrontal and parieto-occipital neural signatures of evidence accumulation and response to computerised Cognitive Behavioural Therapy in depression.

## 抑郁症的证据积累和对计算机化认知行为疗法的反应的前额叶和顶枕神经信号。

Computerised Cognitive Behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective psychological intervention for mild to moderate depression. While CBT aims to correct maladaptive cognitive biases and ensuing disadvantageous decision-making, our current understanding of its mechanisms of change and associated neural substrates remains limited. Preliminary behavioural evidence has shown that the process of evidence accumulation (EA), indexing the efficiency of decision dynamics, is impaired in depression. However, little is known about the role of EA in the context of CBT for depression. In this study we recruited 37 (18 females) unmedicated depressed subjects. Participants attended two task-based functional resonance imaging sessions before and two months after completing an online self-help CBT-based intervention. We fitted a hybrid reinforcement learning drift diffusion model to the probabilistic reversal learning task data and investigated accumulator-like brain activity as a function of computerised CBT. We found that at baseline, responders, compared to nonresponders, exhibited weaker left prefrontal and parieto-occipital EA neural signatures, which subsequently increased in proportion to the sustained symptomatic improvement observed following computerised CBT. We thus provide novel evidence that attenuated EA neural signatures in the left prefrontal and parieto-occipital cortical areas are associated with response to computerised CBT in depression. Crucially, the observed increase of accumulator-like brain activity following computerised CBT warrants further investigation in future experimental work probing neurocomputational mechanisms of change in CBT.

# Machine Learning Identification of TSPAN7 as a Key Target Linking Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Colorectal Cancer

## TSPAN7作为连接2型糖尿病和结直肠癌的关键靶标的机器学习识别

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5651334/latest

Background Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Colorectal Cancer (CRC) are significant global public health challenges with a notable epidemiological association. This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism behind this epidemiological association.Methods Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression gene (DEG) analysis were conducted to identify shared genes between T2DM and CRC. Machine learning algorithms, including LASSO, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were employed to identify hub genes. IOBR and clusterProfiler packages were used for immunoinfiltration assessment and enrichment analysis, respectively.Results We identified 27 shared genes between T2DM and CRC, with TSPAN7 emerging as a key hub gene linking the two conditions. TSPAN7 expression was significantly lower in disease groups compared to control groups across multiple cohorts, demonstrating excellent diagnostic accuracy. Enrichment analysis revealed involvement of these genes in various metabolic activities and pathways, including sulfur metabolism, selenium metabolism, renin secretion, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, TRP channel regulation, and efferocytosis.Conclusion This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the association between T2DM and CRC by identifying TSPAN7 as a key target. The findings offer theoretical evidence for developing new diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies for these diseases.

# Prognostic Prediction Using Recursive Partitioning Analysis of Patients Undergoing Salvage Surgery for Locally Recurrent Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma

## 使用递归分区分析对局部复发性口腔鳞状细胞癌进行挽救性手术的患者进行预后预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5475553/latest

Background The prognosis of patients with locally recurrent oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (LR-OCSCC) remains poor even when salvage surgery can be performed. Therefore, the current study aimed to identify negative prognostic factors in these patients and use recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), a machine learning statistical method, to develop a prognostic classification based on these factors.Methods The clinical data of 75 patients who underwent salvage surgery for LR-OCSCC at the National Cancer Center between 2010 and 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Prognostic factors were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Patients were classified by survival outcomes using RPA. Survival rates were determined using the Kaplan&amp;ndash;Meier method.Results The 3-year overall survival (OS) and locoregional recurrence rates for all patients who underwent salvage surgery were 53.4% and 32.7%, respectively.  The univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified concurrent regional recurrence, previous history of radiotherapy to the neck, and recurrence within 12 months from initial treatment as negative prognostic factors. RPA was performed using these variables and patients were classified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on a combination of concurrent regional recurrence and time to recurrence. The 3-year OS rates for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 73.3%, 53.3%, and 24.4%, respectively.Conclusion A novel prognostic classification for LR-OCSCC salvage surgery was developed to facilitate development of treatment strategies and identification of patients that would not benefit from this procedure.

# Regional differences in peripapillary scleral fibroblast cytoskeleton and nuclear morphology after intraocular pressure elevation in mouse eyes

## 小鼠眼眼压升高后乳头周围巩膜成纤维细胞细胞骨架和核形态的区域差异

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5397173/latest

These studies aimed to study the mechanisms of glaucomatous peripapillary scleral (PPS) remodeling by investigating IOP-induced changes in fibroblast actin-collagen alignment and nuclear morphology in mouse PPS. Cryosections from the optic nerve heads (ONH) of eyes isolated 1- and 6-weeks after bead-induced IOP elevation were imaged for nuclei, fibrillar actin (FA), and collagen (second harmonic generation, SHG). Nuclear morphology was analyzed using VAMPIRE machine-learning image analysis and FA-collagen alignment was determined by comparing vector fields of FA and SHG images. Nuclear morphology was regionally defined with the inner pial PPS (pPPS) containing nuclei with higher aspect ratios than the peripheral PPS (outer PPS, oPPS) and peripheral sclera. FA-collagen alignment was higher in the PPS than in the peripheral sclera (7.1&plusmn;2.5&deg; versus 10.0&plusmn;1.4&deg;, p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.05, n&thinsp;=&thinsp;6). One and six weeks after BI, there were nuclear morphologic changes reflecting a transition to a rounder shape in all scleral regions and persistently reduced FA-collagen alignment in the PPS regions. This study therefore concludes that chronic IOP elevation is associated with persistent alterations in nuclear morphology and FA-collagen alignment that indicate sustained cellular responses to tissue stress. These changes could be a precursor to more chronic scleral remodeling that underlies glaucoma pathogenesis.

# Association between anemia and cognitive dysfunction in the hypertensive elderly: a cross-sectional study

## 老年高血压患者贫血与认知功能障碍关系的横断面研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5470638/latest

Background
Cognitive dysfunction has become one of the most serious social health problems around the world. Anemia may increase the risk of cognitive dysfunction in elderly population. Hypertension may also deteriorate cognitive function. Few studies reported the association of anemia and cognitive dysfunction in hypertensive elderly.
Methods
Data were obtained from the 2011&ndash;2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Cognitive performance was evaluated by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease (CERAD) Word Learning subtest, the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Multivariate logistic regression analysis and subgroup analysis were conducted to assess the relationship between anemia and cognitive dysfunction.
Results
A total of 2005 elderly participants (aged&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;60 years) were included. Anemia was associated with the greater risk of low cognitive performance in hypertensive elderly (OR&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.427, 95% CI: 1.065&ndash;1.911). Anemia was associated with lower performance in AFT (OR&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.331, 95% CI: 1.008&ndash;1.758) and DSST (OR&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.818, 95% CI: 1.335&ndash;2.475). In subgroups of age younger than 65 or older than 80 years, being a female, being non-Hispanic White, with poverty income ratio less than 5.00, being a nonsmoker or nondrinker, anemia was significantly associated with cognitive dysfunction.
Conclusions
The findings of the present study suggest the existence of an association between anemia and low cognitive performance among hypertensive elderly.
Clinical trial number: not applicable.

# Differential Diagnosis of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension via Deep Multimodal Modeling of Noninvasive Measurements

## 通过无创测量的深度多模式建模对肺动脉高压进行鉴别诊断

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5652320/latest

Background
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare yet progressive disorder characterized by elevated blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs, often presenting without an evident cause. The distinction between pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and PH due to left heart disease (PH-LHD) is crucial due to differences in treatment approach and prognosis. A correct diagnosis is essential to ensuring that patients receive the appropriate treatment. However, the current diagnosis of PAH and PH-LHD faces clinical limitations due to its reliance on invasive hemodynamic measurements or the limits of data modeling.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study involving 905 PH patients from Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, incorporating CT images and clinical textual data. A heterogeneous graph neural network was constructed on multimodal data. We developed and validated a heterogeneous network to predict the probability of PAH and PH-LHD. The new method exhibits strong discrimination between PAH and PH-LHD.
Findings
In the multiple cross-validations, it achieved a 0.943 AUC when using a combination of image and textual data, a 0.869 AUC for only textual variables, and a 0.715 AUC for only images. It also evaluated the type-dependent performances, yielding the best AUC (0.896) when using a subgroup of variables. The best performance (AUC=0.809) can be achieved by using only ECG variables in our model.
Interpretation
Our study provides a quantitative rationale for modulating multimodal data to enhance differential diagnosis of PAH and PH-LHD with only noninvasive measurements.

# Machine learning models in predicting high malignant potential in gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis

## 预测胃肠道间质瘤高恶性潜能的机器学习模型: 系统回顾和荟萃分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5382250/latest

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) present diverse biological behaviors and varying malignancy risks, necessitating early detection and effective risk stratification. Machine learning (ML) models are emerging as valuable tools for assessing the malignant potential of GIST. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the efficacy of various ML models in predicting GIST malignancy. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, up to April 22, 2024. After article selection, we extracted essential data and performed meta-analysis to aggregate the c-index, sensitivity, and specificity. The risk of bias was assessed using the PROBAST framework. Our analysis included 12 studies involving 20 ML models and 2,859 patients. Tumor size emerged as the most significant predictor. The pooled c-index was 0.89 (training) and 0.87 (test), with sensitivities of 0.85 and 0.82, and specificities of 0.89 and 0.75, respectively. Two studies had high bias risk, while ten had low bias, although overall applicability was considered low due to inadequate data sources. ML models demonstrate strong diagnostic capabilities in predicting GIST malignancy, with the Logistic Regression model performing best. Key predictive factors included tumor size, necrosis, ulceration, and shape regularity. Future models should integrate impactful disease predictors to enhance clinical utility.

# Evaluation of a Training Program for Healthcare Professionals Supporting Informal Caregivers of People with Dementia: A Pre-Post Quasi-Experimental Study

## 对支持痴呆症患者非正式护理人员的医疗保健专业人员培训计划的评估: 一项准实验研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5455672/latest

Background Despite their proven effectiveness, support interventions for caregivers of people with neurodegenerative diseases struggle to be sustainably implemented. In this context, the &amp;ldquo;Caregivers /Network-Service&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Aidants Proches / R&amp;eacute;seau-Service&amp;rdquo;) project (Interreg) aimed to create a network of professionals specialized in supporting family caregivers through training programs. The goal of this study was to determine the overall impact of the proposed training.Methods A total of 217 healthcare professionals participated in the training, and 108 agreed to take part in the study. Based on the Kirkpatrick-Barr framework (Barr et al., 2000) and the study by Parmar et al. (2022), the training&amp;rsquo;s outcomes were evaluated at four levels: (1) professionals&amp;rsquo; reactions to the training, (2) changes in their learning (knowledge and skills), (3) changes in their practices, (4A) organizational changes, and (4B) clinical changes. For the latter level, a multiple case study was conducted with caregivers receiving individualized support from trained professionals.Results The training was highly appreciated and improved the knowledge, skills, and practices of the professionals.  It also promoted organizational changes, such as the implementation of new support services for caregivers. The individualized support provided by the trained professionals appeared to have positive clinical effects on caregivers, who also recommended the service.Conclusion Given the demonstrated effectiveness of these support services, as highlighted by our research, and in light of the lack of initiatives in the field, we strongly recommend the implementation of such training programs for healthcare professionals.

# Prediction models and prognostic analysis of immune-related acute kidney injury in lung cancer patients

## 肺癌患者免疫相关急性肾损伤预测模型及预后分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5388659/latest

Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are extensively utilized in lung cancer patients, with documented instances of ICIs-associated acute kidney injury (ICIs-AKI). This study aims to explore the incidence rates, clinical features, risk factors, and prognostic outcomes of ICIs-AKI, while developing a model for early recognition of ICIs-AKI.
Methods: The study involved 413 adult lung cancer patients treated with ICIs at Ningbo No.2 Hospital between Sept. 1, 2021, and June 30, 2023. Patients were followed until death or Dec. 31, 2023, and categorized into ICIs-AKI or non-AKI groups. Prediction models for ICIs-AKI were developed using logistic regression and MLP neural networks. Cox proportional-hazards models assessed the association between ICIs-AKI and overall survival.
Results: The study included 381 lung cancer patients receiving ICIs treatment after excluding 32 patients. ICIs-AKI occurred in 13.39% of cases, with a median onset time of [123 (63, 303)] days. Multivariable logistic analysis identified diabetes, proteinuria, extrarenal irAEs, diuretic use, and chemotherapy as significant risk factors (all P&amp;lt;0.05), while higher baseline eGFR levels were protective (P&amp;lt;0.05). Two prediction models were developed: logistic regression (AUC=0.877, sensitivity=0.922, specificity=0.726) and MLP (AUC=0.950, accuracy=0.843, precision=0.847). Survival analysis showed no difference in overall survival between ICIs-AKI and non-AKI groups (HR=1.021, 95% CI=0.629-1.659, P=0.932; adjusted HR=0.950, 95% CI=0.558-1.616, P=0.849). AKI to CKD progression incidence was 58.82%, with no significant difference in overall survival between CKD and non-CKD groups (P=0.157).
Conclusion: This study offers detailed insights into ICIs-AKI, including its rate, onset timing, risk factors, and clinical features. Approximately half of the affected patients experienced spontaneous renal function recovery. Both logistic regression and MLP models effectively predicted ICIs-AKI. Importantly, neither ICIs-AKI incidence nor renal function restoration correlated with patient mortality. These findings improve understanding of ICIs-AKI and underscore the importance of early detection and management strategies.

# Development of machine learning Predictive Model for Type 2 Diabetic Retinopathy Using the Triglyceride-glucose index explained by SHAP method

## 利用SHAP方法解释的甘油三酯-葡萄糖指数建立2型糖尿病视网膜病变的机器学习预测模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5602589/latest

Introduction: This study aimed to develop a diabetic retinopathy (DR) Prediction model using various machine learning algorithms incorporating the novel predictor Triglyceride-glucose index (TyG). Furthermore, the model was interpreted using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method.
Method: Real-world data were collected from a general hospital in a major city and a county clinic, then divided into the DR Group (1392) and non-DR group (2358). Baseline data were collected, and variables were selected using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV). The performance of five machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression model (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost (XGB), was assessed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating characteristic Curve (ROC). The optimal model was interpreted using SHAP.
Result：SVM and LR demonstrated superior performance in both the test set and training set (ROC, 0.85 and 0.82, respectively). The top five predictors identified by SHAP analysis included TyG, Insulin therapy, HbA1c, Diabetes Course, HDL. HDL was identified as a protective factor, while the remaining factors were associated with retinopathy.
Conclusion：LR and SVM demonstrated the best performance. This is the first study constructing a DR Prediction model using TyG index. Notably, TyG significantly predicted DR and may serve as a crucial indicator for guiding clinical screening of high DR Risk.

# AI-Enhanced Triage: Improving Musculoskeletal Care with Data Driven Screening of Referral Letters

## 人工智能增强的分诊: 通过数据驱动的转诊信筛选来改善肌肉骨骼护理

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5146275/latest

Background Thirty percent of General Practitioners' (GP) consultations concern musculoskeletal symptoms (MSK). Many of those are referred to a rheumatology outpatient clinic. Triaging the GPs&amp;rsquo; referral letters is an important task to prioritise patients in need of early treatment such as those likely to have rheumatoid arthritis. The letters may provide valuable insights into patients' conditions beyond the reasons for referral described by the GPs.Objective We set out to build a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline using only GP referral letters to accelerate prioritisation of referrals by identifying: I) RA, II) osteoarthritis, III) fibromyalgia and IV) patients who remain under the care of a rheumatologist for &amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;3 months.Methods We collected 8,044 valid referral letters from 5,728 patients across 12 different clinics affiliated to Reumazorg Zuid West Nederland, splitting the data into a development set (Roosendaal and Goes; n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;7,213) and an external replication set (remaining centres; n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;831). We preprocessed the narrative data by I) removing named entities, II) batch correction, III) and transforming the data to a vector with term frequency by inverse document frequency. For each disease we trained an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model, which we fine tuned across 1000 epochs with a Bayesian optimization technique, and validated on a hold out data set. Next, we assessed the generalizability to other centres by applying our models on the external data. Finally, we compared the prioritisation ability of our RA-classifier versus the current referral order to assess the additive value of ML to patient triaging.Results The pipeline produced models with a consistent performance in the replication set. Our classifiers did not merely &amp;lsquo;extract&amp;rsquo; the suspected diagnosis by the GP, rather it identifies implicit structure in the text indicative of the disease in question. We achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.78 (CI:0.74&amp;ndash;0.83) for RA, 0.71 (CI: 0.67&amp;ndash;0.74) for osteoarthritis, 0.81 (CI: 0.77&amp;ndash;0.85) for fibromyalgia and 0.63 (CI: 0.61&amp;ndash;0.66) for chronic follow-up. For RA we could define a cut-off that would preselect two-thirds of all RA patients, while excluding two thirds of non-RA patients, both in holdout and final test set. Finally, our classifier was able to prioritise RA over non-RA cases (P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001), while the manual referral system could not significantly differentiate between RA and non-RA.Conclusion Prior to a rheumatology outpatient clinic visit, we could effectively identify patients with high risk for RA, Osteoarthritis and Fibromyalgia. Patients that were chronically followed-up at the rheumatology clinic were difficult to predict, likely due to patients&amp;rsquo; heterogeneity. For all four classification tasks we could improve visit prioritisation compared to current waiting times. Overall, our algorithm has potential to improve care efficiency, reduce clinicians' workload, and facilitate early specialised care. Future research is needed to integrate these models into a comprehensive decision support tool for clinical use.

# Predicting work ability impairment in Post COVID-19 patients: a machine learning model based on clinical parameters

## 预测COVID-19后患者的工作能力障碍: 基于临床参数的机器学习模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5119120/latest

The Post COVID-19 condition (PCC) is a complex disease affecting health and everyday functioning. This is well reflected by a patient&rsquo;s inability to work (ITW). In this study, we aimed to investigate factors associated with ITW and to design a machine learning-based model for predicting ITW twelve months after baseline.
We selected patients from the post COVID care study (PCC-study) with data on their ability to work. To identify factors associated with ITW, we compared PCC patients with and without ITW. For constructing a predictive model, we selected nine clinical parameters: hospitalization during the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, WHO severity of acute infection, presence of somatic comorbidities, presence of psychiatric comorbidities, age, height, weight, Karnofsky index, and symptoms. The model was trained to predict ITW twelve months after baseline using TensorFlow Decision Forests. Its performance was investigated using cross-validation and an independent testing dataset.
In total, 259 PCC patients were included in this analysis. We observed that ITW was associated with dyslipidemia, worse patient reported outcomes (FSS, WHOQOL-BREF, PHQ-9), a higher rate of preexisting psychiatric conditions, and a more extensive medical work-up. The predictive model exhibited a mean AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78; 0.88) in the 10-fold cross-validation. In the testing dataset, the AUC was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.58; 0.93).
In conclusion, we identified several factors associated with ITW. The predictive model performed very well. It could guide management decisions and help setting mid- to long-term treatment goals by aiding the identification of patients at risk of extended ITW.

# Potential Targets for Epilepsy Treatment: An Integrated Study Based on Multi-omics, Mendelian Randomization, Immune Infiltration Assessment, and Machine Learning

## 癫痫治疗的潜在靶点: 基于多组学、孟德尔随机化、免疫浸润评估和机器学习的综合研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5656048/latest

Background: Epilepsy is a severe neurological disease. Exploring the intrinsic mechanisms of the onset and development of epilepsy, and seeking new therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers, remain very important for epilepsy research.
Methods: Two independent epilepsy microarray datasets from the GEO database were used to identify differentially expressed genes. And eQTL exposure factor data from the GWAS database were used for Mendelian randomization analysis to identify genes associated with epilepsy. The intersection of genes from the two sources was taken to identify key genes for epilepsy. Subsequently, various enrichment analyses and immune infiltration assessments were performed on the key genes to explore their functions and the pathways involved in the epileptic process. Finally, four machine learning models were used to construct a nomogram to evaluate the risk of epilepsy.
Results: This study identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with epilepsy, including 163 up-regulated DEGs and 100 down-regulated DEGs. Combined with Mendelian randomization analysis, seven key genes were confirmed: ASAH1, RASGRP1, PGLYRP1, ARG1, TBC1D4, PDIA6, and SLPI. These gene enrichments were involved in cellular material transport networks, related cellular components, as well as amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, neurotrophic factor signaling pathways, sphingolipid metabolism, Toll-like receptor and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways, Ras/MAPK signaling pathways, phagocytosis, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. CIBERSORT analysis revealed the unique distribution of immune cells in epilepsy and the regulation of key genes on immune cells, further emphasizing the importance of immune processes in the disease. The nomogram constructed based on these genes provides a quantitative prediction of epilepsy risk.
Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of epilepsy and demonstrate the potential for treating epilepsy by targeting specific molecular pathways, laying the groundwork for future research and clinical work.

# A Single Far-Field Wavefront Reconstruction Method Based on a Mixed Focal Length-Fresnel Zone Plate and AM-CNN

## 基于混合焦距-菲涅耳波带片和am-cnn的单远场波前重建方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5660455/latest

In adaptive optics, multiple different incident wavefronts may correspond to the same far-field intensity distribution, resulting in a many to one mapping relationship. This paper proposes a single far-field wavefront reconstruction method based on a mixed focal length-Fresnel zone plate (MFL-FZP) and neural network. First, the phase modulation and imaging are integrated, allowing partial focal plane information and defocus information of the wavefront to be reflected in the same far-field spot. It can break the symmetry of the near-field wavefront, overcome the problem of multiple solutions, and reconstruct a unique wavefront based on the light spot. Then, an attention mechanism-based convolutional neural network (AM-CNN) is introduced to establish an accurate nonlinear mapping between a single far-field image and a near-field wavefront. Compared to ResNet, VGG networks, AM-CNN has superior speed and accuracy, AM-CNN has superior speed and accuracy. In addition, a comparative verification work is conducted on the existing four quadrant discrete phase modulation and spiral discrete phase modulation methods, and the results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy and stronger robustness. Finally, the influence of defocusing amount on reconstruction accuracy is quantitatively discussed. The test results show that the optimal defocusing amount of the MFL-FZP is 1 &lambda;, and the average root mean square (RMS) of the residual wavefront is 0.012 &lambda;. The average RMS for residual wavefronts under different turbulence intensities is only 1.5% of the incident wavefronts, and the inference time is 3.2 ms. To further substantiate the method's practicality, we constructed an experimental optical setup, which confirmed the simulation results and demonstrated the method&rsquo;s robust performance in real-world conditions. This work offers an efficient and high-precision method for single-frame wavefront reconstruction, validated through both simulations and experiments.

Fostering connectedness among tertiary education students has been linked to positive academic outcomes and University experience. Further, a sense of connectedness with peers has been linked to the development of stronger interpersonal skills. However, little research has examined peer connectedness specifically in postgraduate health science cohorts, where skills like empathy are crucial in graduate clinical careers. This study examined the content validity of the Connected Classroom Climate Inventory (CCCI) in postgraduate health science students, and its construct validity in relation to self-efficacy for clinical skills. Students completed two questionnaires: the CCCI (Dwyer et al., 2004), and the Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) (Kang et al., 2019). The CCCI measures students' perceptions of connectedness with their peers. The SES measures self-perceived clinical competence, and the questionnaires were modified to reflect audiology or social work skills. In a sample of 72 Masters students from audiology and social work programs, the 20-item CCCI demonstrated excellent internal consistency (&alpha;&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.94). The CCCI scores showed a moderate positive correlation (r&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.46, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.001) with scores on the SES for degree-specific clinical skills. These findings provide evidence for the content and construct validity of the CCCI in this postgraduate population. The positive association between CCCI and self-efficacy suggests that promoting connectedness could benefit the development of self-efficacy and preparedness for clinical practice. By reliably measuring connectedness using the validated CCCI, universities can identify students who may need support, evaluate interventions, and optimize learning environments for postgraduate health science students.

# Citric acid water as an alternative to food restriction to motivate task performance in mice during touchscreen testing

## 柠檬酸水作为食物限制的替代品，以激发触摸屏测试期间小鼠的任务表现

Rodent behavioural testing paradigms in touchscreen operant chambers have successfully provided insight into the neural mechanisms underlying various cognitive domains in healthy and disease models. Touchscreen testing has previously required food restriction to sufficiently motivate rodents to complete behavioural tests, limiting the use of interventions, for example diet-based interventions, that alter animals&amp;rsquo; motivation for food in experimental design. Here, we explored the safety and efficacy of water manipulation via addition of citric acid in motivating behavioural performance in touchscreen operant chambers 1) in comparison with food restriction and 2) when mice are fed an obesogenic high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) diet. Water manipulation and food restriction produced similar performance on the progressive ratio task in non-obesogenic, standard-fed mice. However, when water-manipulated mice were fed a HFHS diet they showed deficits in this motivation-sensitive task. Critically, all groups, regardless of restriction type or diet, showed similar learning curves during a pairwise visual discrimination task. Together, these findings demonstrate that water manipulation can safely and effectively motivate mice to perform touchscreen tasks for reward, even when fed a highly satiating HFHS diet, which opens the possibility of using interventions, especially diet-based, in conjunction with touchscreen cognitive testing batteries.

# Defining the Learning Outcomes and Core Curriculum for Clinical Clerkships

## 定义临床见习的学习成果和核心课程

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5475989/latest

Background: The core curriculum is defined as a curriculum that is essential and common to all students. Defining the core curriculum for clinical clerkships will help to clarify the content to which disorders and skills must be mastered by students.
Objectives: This study aimed to define the content of the clinical clerkship core curriculum based on the expectations of graduates to work at the primary healthcare level.
Methods: The core learning outcomes of clinical clerkships were defined by starting from diseases, clinical presentations, conditions, and skills listed in SaudiMeds framework and the Saudi Medical Licensing Exam content outline. Although some diseases are expected to be managed at the primary care level, only emergency management or preliminary diagnosis with referral to a more advanced level is required. Thus, the knowledge and skills to be acquired for each disease/disorder are competencies in one or more of the following areas: preliminary diagnosis, diagnosis, treatment, emergency management, prevention, and follow-up.
Results and Conclusion: A total of 404 diseases/disorders and 137 skills (66 procedural and 71 examination skills) were listed, and their levels of knowledge and performance were defined. The clerkships where each clinical skill should be practiced and acquired were also identified.
The implementation of the clinical core curriculum faces challenges due to faculty practices and the misinterpretation of some hospital policies.
This final document can be shared with other medical schools to define the core curriculum on a national basis.

# AI-Augmented IS-IS Routing Framework for Optimized IoT Networks

## 用于优化IoT网络的AI增强IS-IS路由框架

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5670333/latest

In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), efficient and reliable routing is crucial for maintaining optimal network performance. Traditional IS-IS routing protocols, while foundational, often fall short in dynamic IoT environments due to their static nature. This paper presents an AI-augmented IS-IS routing framework, leveraging the capabilities of reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning, to dynamically adjust routing paths. The proposed framework aims to enhance energy efficiency, reduce latency, and improve packet delivery ratios. Through comprehensive simulations, our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional routing protocols. Additionally, this study addresses the challenges associated with implementing AI-driven routing in IoT networks and explores potential future enhancements to further optimize performance.

# Learning about the liveability of cities from young migrants using the combinatorial-Hodge-theory approach

## 使用组合霍奇理论方法从年轻移民中了解城市的宜居性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5575866/latest

Migration is a major decision to leave one place and move to another, involving career and life changes. Migration flows provide people's comparisons across places about which is better to live by ''vote with their feet'' (Tiebout, 1956). However, is it possible to derive a consistent measure of the liveability of cities from these flows? We propose a combinatorial-Hodge-theory approach: the empirical liveability of cities is evaluated by a potential governing unbalanced, acyclic migrations between cities. As a case study, we measure the liveability of municipalities in Japan for specific populations such as families with small children and women of reproductive age in a population-decline society. Using these potentials as dependent variables, we perform a regression analysis to identify the factors relevant to liveability. We also derive analytical expressions that allow us to interpret as potentials the standards of living or utilities, estimated in the economics literature (Douglas &amp; Wall, 1993; Douglas, 1997; Douglas &amp; Wall, 2000; Wall, 2001; Nakajima &amp; Tabuchi, 2011). The proposed method extracts a consistent metric of interval scale from the non-transitive, pairwise comparison between locations and provides substantial statistics for urban planning by policymakers.

# FTLinear: MLP based on Fourier Transform for Multivariate Time-series Forecasting

## FTLinear: 基于傅里叶变换的MLP用于多元时间序列预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5654336/latest

Most existing multivariate time series forecasting models are based on Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs), Graph Neural Networks(GNNs), and Transformers, which leads to high model complexity. Although linear models based on Multi-layer Perceptrons(MLPs) have the advantages of low complexity and high performance, they fail to capture the long-term dependencies in time series, resulting in poor forecasting performance. This paper proposes a linear model based on Fourier Transform, FTLinear, which first converts the time series to the frequency domain, then uses frequency enhancement to remove noise from the data, and finally obtains the output through a simple linear transformation. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves MSE and MAE by 18.48% and 8.03% respectively compared to iTransformer, by 12.03% and 2.35% respectively compared to PatchTST, and by 17.75% and 7.52% respectively compared to DLinear on 8 public datasets. This demonstrates that converting time series to the frequency domain can provide the model with a global perspective, enhancing its ability to capture long-term dependencies and thus improving forecasting performance.
