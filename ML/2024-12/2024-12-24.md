Many techniques in computational materials science require scientists to identify the right set of parameters that capture the physics of the specific material they are studying. Calculating these parameters from scratch is sometimes possible but costs a lot of time and computational power. Consequently, scientists are always eager to find more efficient ways to estimate them without doing the full calculation.

# SICGNN: structurally informed convolutional graph neural networks for protein classification

## SICGNN: 用于蛋白质分类的结构通知卷积图神经网络

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various domains, including social networks, recommender systems, protein classification, molecular property prediction, and genetic networks. In bioinformatics and chemical engineering, considerable research is being actively conducted to represent molecules or proteins on graphs by conceptualizing atoms or amino acids as nodes and the relationships between nodes as edges. The overall structures of proteins and their interconnections are crucial for predicting and classifying their properties. However, as GNNs stack more layers to create deeper networks, the embeddings between nodes may become excessively similar, causing an oversmoothing problem that reduces the performance for downstream tasks. To avoid this, GNNs typically use a limited number of layers, which leads to the problem of reflecting only the local structure and neighborhood information rather than the global structure of the graph. Therefore, we propose a structurally informed convolutional GNN (SICGNN) that utilizes information that can express the overall topological structure of a protein graph during GNN training and prediction. By explicitly including information of the entire graph topology, the proposed model can utilize both local neighborhood and global structural information. We applied the SICGNN to representative GNNs such as GraphSAGE, graph isomorphism network, and graph attention network, and confirmed performance improvements across various datasets. We also demonstrate the robustness of SICGNN using multiple stratified 10-fold cross-validations and various hyperparameter settings, and demonstrate that its accuracy is comparable or better than those of existing GNN models.

Efficient and accurate characterization of an experimental setup is a critical requirement in any physical setting. In the quantum realm, the characterization of an unknown operator is experimentally accomplished via Quantum Process Tomography (QPT). This technique combines the outcomes of different projective measurements to reconstruct the underlying process matrix, typically extracted from maximum-likelihood estimation. Here, we exploit the logical correspondence between optical polarization and two-level quantum systems to retrieve the complex action of structured metasurfaces within a QPT-inspired context. In particular, we investigate a deep-learning approach that allows for fast and accurate reconstructions of space-dependent SU(2) operators by only processing a minimal set of measurements. We train a convolutional neural network based on a scalable U-Net architecture to process entire experimental images in parallel. Synthetic processes are reconstructed with average fidelity above 90%. The performance of our routine is experimentally validated in the case of space-dependent polarization transformations acting on a classical laser beam. Our approach further expands the toolbox of data-driven approaches to QPT and shows promise in the real-time characterization of complex optical gates.

Abstract: The acceleration of material property calculations while maintaining ab initio accuracy (1 meV/atom) is one of the major challenges in computational physics. In this paper, we introduce a Python package enhancing the computation of (finite temperature) material properties at the ab initio level using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP). The Machine-Learning Assisted Canonical Sampling (MLACS) method, grounded in a self-consistent variational approach, iteratively trains a MLIP using an active learning strategy in order to significantly reduce the computational cost of ab initio simulations.
  MLACS offers a modular and user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT) codes, MLIP potentials, and molecular dynamics packages, enabling a wide range of applications, while maintaining a near-DFT accuracy. These include sampling the canonical ensemble of a system, performing free energy calculations, transition path sampling, and geometry optimization, all by utilizing surrogate MLIP potentials, in place of ab initio calculations.
  This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and implementation of the MLACS method. We also demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency through various examples, showcasing the capabilities of the MLACS package.

# A Decision Transformer Approach to Grain Boundary Network Optimization

**Authors:** Christopher W. Adair, Oliver K. Johnson

arXiv:2412.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As microstructure property models improve, additional information from crystallographic degrees of freedom and grain boundary networks (GBNs) can be included in microstructure design problems. However, the high dimensional nature of including this information precludes the use of many common optimization approaches and requires less efficient methods to generate quality designs. Previous work demonstrated that human-in-the-loop optimization, instantiated as a video game, achieved high-quality, efficient solutions to these design problems. However, such data is expensive to obtain. In the present work, we show how a Decision Transformer machine learning (ML) model can be used to learn from the optimization trajectories generated by human players, and subsequently solve materials design problems. We compare the ML optimization trajectories against players and a common global optimization algorithm: simulated annealing (SA). We find that the ML model exhibits a validation accuracy of 84% against player decisions, and achieves solutions of comparable quality to SA (92%), but does so using three orders of magnitude fewer iterations. We find that the ML model generalizes in important and surprising ways, including the ability to train using a simple constitutive structure-property model and then solve microstructure design problems for a different, higher-fidelity, constitutive structure-property model without any retraining. These results demonstrate the potential of Decision Transformer models for the solution of materials design problems.

Abstract: Electrocatalytic water splitting, which produces hydrogen and oxygen through water electrolysis, is a promising method for generating renewable, carbon-free alternative fuels. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by the high costs of Pt cathodes and IrO$_{x}$/RuO$_{x}$ anode catalysts. In the search for cost-effective alternatives, barium titanate (BaTiO$_{3}$) has emerged as a compelling candidate. This inexpensive, non-toxic perovskite oxide can be synthesized from earth-abundant precursors and has shown potential for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in recent studies. In this work, we explore the OER activity of pristine and Ni-doped BaTiO$_{3}$ at explicit water interfaces using metadynamics (MetaD) simulations. To enable efficient and practical MetaD for OER, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential based on artificial neural networks (ANN), achieving large-scale and long-time simulations with near-DFT accuracy. Our simulations reveal that Ni-doping enhances the catalytic activity of BaTiO$_{3}$ for OER, consistent with experimental observations, while providing mechanistic insights into this enhancement.

arXiv:2412.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-angle scattering (SAS) techniques are indispensable tools for probing the structure of soft materials. However, traditional analytical models often face limitations in structural inversion for complex systems, primarily due to the absence of closed-form expressions of scattering functions. To address these challenges, we present a machine learning framework based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for directly extracting real-space structural information from scattering spectra in reciprocal space. This model-independent, data-driven approach provides a versatile solution for analyzing intricate configurations in soft matter. By applying the KAN to lyotropic lamellar phases and colloidal suspensions -- two representative soft matter systems -- we demonstrate its ability to accurately and efficiently resolve structural collectivity and complexity. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing the quantitative analysis of soft materials, paving the way for robust structural inversion across diverse systems.

arXiv:2412.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-width one hidden layer networks with multiple neurons in the readout layer display non-trivial output-output correlations that vanish in the lazy-training infinite-width limit. In this manuscript we leverage recent progress in the proportional limit of Bayesian deep learning (that is the limit where the size of the training set $P$ and the width of the hidden layers $N$ are taken to infinity keeping their ratio $\alpha = P/N$ finite) to rationalize this empirical evidence. In particular, we show that output-output correlations in finite fully-connected networks are taken into account by a kernel shape renormalization of the infinite-width NNGP kernel, which naturally arises in the proportional limit. We perform accurate numerical experiments both to assess the predictive power of the Bayesian framework in terms of generalization, and to quantify output-output correlations in finite-width networks. By quantitatively matching our predictions with the observed correlations, we provide additional evidence that kernel shape renormalization is instrumental to explain the phenomenology observed in finite Bayesian one hidden layer networks.

Abstract: Reproducibility, endurance, driftless data retention, and fine resolution of the programmable conductance weights are key technological requirements against memristive artificial synapses in neural network applications. However, the inherent fluctuations in the active volume impose severe constraints on the weight resolution. In order to understand and push these limits, a comprehensive noise benchmarking and noise reduction protocol is introduced. Our approach goes beyond the measurement of steady-state readout noise levels and tracks the voltage-dependent noise characteristics all along the resistive switching $I(V)$ curves. Furthermore, we investigate the tunability of the noise level by dedicated voltage cycling schemes in our filamentary Ta$_2$O$_5$ memristors. This analysis highlights a broad, order-of-magnitude variability of the possible noise levels behind seemingly reproducible switching cycles. Our nonlinear noise spectroscopy measurements identify a subthreshold voltage region with voltage-boosted fluctuations. This voltage range enables the reconfiguration of the fluctuators without resistive switching, yielding a highly denoised state within a few subthreshold cycles.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of long-range forces is critical in atomistic simulations, as they play a central role in determining the properties of materials and chemical systems. However, standard machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often rely on short-range approximations, limiting their applicability to systems with significant electrostatics and dispersion forces. We recently introduced the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) method, which captures long-range electrostatics without explicitly learning atomic charges or charge equilibration. Extending LES, we incorporate the ability to learn physical partial charges, encode charge states, and the option to impose charge neutrality constraints. We benchmark LES on diverse and challenging systems, including charged molecules, ionic liquid, electrolyte solution, polar dipeptides, surface adsorption, electrolyte/solid interfaces, and solid-solid interfaces. Our results show that LES can effectively infer physical partial charges, dipole and quadrupole moments, as well as achieve better accuracy compared to methods that explicitly learn charges. LES thus provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable MLIP framework for simulating complex systems with intricate charge transfer and long-range

Abstract: We study the exploration-exploitation trade-off for large multiplayer coordination games where players strategise via Q-Learning, a common learning framework in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Q-Learning is known to have two shortcomings, namely non-convergence and potential equilibrium selection problems, when there are multiple fixed points, called Quantal Response Equilibria (QRE). Furthermore, whilst QRE have full support for finite games, it is not clear how Q-Learning behaves as the game becomes large. In this paper, we characterise the critical exploration rate that guarantees convergence to a unique fixed point, addressing the two shortcomings above. Using a generating-functional method, we show that this rate increases with the number of players and the alignment of their payoffs. For many-player coordination games with perfectly aligned payoffs, this exploration rate is roughly twice that of $p$-player zero-sum games. As for large games, we provide a structural result for QRE, which suggests that as the game size increases, Q-Learning converges to a QRE near the boundary of the simplex of the action space, a phenomenon we term asymptotic extinction, where a constant fraction of the actions are played with zero probability at a rate $o(1/N)$ for an $N$-action game.

arXiv:2412.15592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In realistic neural circuits, both neurons and synapses are coupled in dynamics with separate time scales. The circuit functions are intimately related to these coupled dynamics. However, it remains challenging to understand the intrinsic properties of the coupled dynamics. Here, we develop the neuron-synapse coupled quasi-potential method to demonstrate how learning induces the qualitative change in macroscopic behaviors of recurrent neural networks. We find that under the Hebbian learning, a large Hebbian strength will alter the nature of the chaos transition, from a continuous type to a discontinuous type, where the onset of chaos requires a smaller synaptic gain compared to the non-plastic counterpart network. In addition, our theory predicts that under feedback and homeostatic learning, the location and type of chaos transition are retained, and only the chaotic fluctuation is adjusted. Our theoretical calculations are supported by numerical simulations.

Abstract: Predicting spectra and related properties such as the dielectric function of crystalline materials based on machine learning has a huge, hitherto unexplored, technological potential. For this reason, we create an ab initio database of 9915 dielectric tensors of semiconductors and insulators calculated in the independent-particle approximation (IPA). In addition, we present the OptiMate family of machine learning models, a series of graph attention neural networks (GAT) trained to predict the dielectric function and refractive index. OptiMate yields accurate prediction of spectra of semiconductors using only their crystal structure. Smooth, artifact-free curves are obtained without these properties being enforced by penalties.

Abstract: The glassy thermal conductivities observed in crystalline inorganic perovskites such as Cs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ is perplexing and lacking theoretical explanations. Here, we first experimentally measure such its thermal transport behavior from 20~K to 300~K, after synthesizing Cs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ single crystals. Using path-integral molecular dynamics simulations driven by machine learning potentials, we reveal that Cs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ has large lattice distortions at low temperatures, which may be related to the large atomic size mismatch. Employing the Wigner formulation of thermal transport, we reproduce the experimental thermal conductivities based on lattice-distorted structures. This study thus provides a framework for predicting and understanding glassy thermal transport in materials with strong lattice disorder.

arXiv:2209.12924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide practical and powerful schemes for learning many properties of an unknown n-qubit quantum state using a sparing number of copies of the state. Specifically, we present a depth-modulated randomized measurement scheme that interpolates between two known classical shadows schemes based on random Pauli measurements and random Clifford measurements. These can be seen within our scheme as the special cases of zero and infinite depth, respectively. We focus on the regime where depth scales logarithmically in n and provide evidence that this retains the desirable properties of both extremal schemes whilst, in contrast to the random Clifford scheme, also being experimentally feasible. We present methods for two key tasks; estimating expectation values of certain observables from generated classical shadows and, computing upper bounds on the depth-modulated shadow norm, thus providing rigorous guarantees on the accuracy of the output estimates. We consider observables that can be written as a linear combination of poly(n) Paulis and observables that can be written as a low bond dimension matrix product operator. For the former class of observables both tasks are solved efficiently in n. For the latter class, we do not guarantee efficiency but present a method that works in practice; by variationally computing a heralded approximate inverses of a tensor network that can then be used for efficiently executing both these tasks.

arXiv:2406.12916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important challenge in machine learning is to predict the initial conditions under which a given neural network will be trainable. We present a method for predicting the trainable regime in parameter space for deep feedforward neural networks (DNNs) based on reconstructing the input from subsequent activation layers via a cascade of single-layer auxiliary networks. We show that a single epoch of training of the shallow cascade networks is sufficient to predict the trainability of the deep feedforward network on a range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and white noise), thereby providing a significant reduction in overall training time. We achieve this by computing the relative entropy between reconstructed images and the original inputs, and show that this probe of information loss is sensitive to the phase behaviour of the network. We further demonstrate that this method generalizes to residual neural networks (ResNets) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Moreover, our method illustrates the network's decision making process by displaying the changes performed on the input data at each layer, which we demonstrate for both a DNN trained on MNIST and the vgg16 CNN trained on the ImageNet dataset. Our results provide a technique for significantly accelerating the training of large neural networks.

**Authors:** David Stewart, Joern Putschke

arXiv:2412.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets clustered from heavy ion collision measurements combine a dense background of particles with those actually resulting from a hard partonic scattering. The background contribution to jet transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) may be corrected by subtracting the collision average background; however, the background inhomogeneity limits the resolution of this correction. Many recent studies have embedded jets into heavy ion backgrounds and demonstrated a markedly improved background correction is achievable by using neural networks (NNs) trained with aspects of jet substructure which are used to map measured jet $p_\mathrm{T}$ to the embedded truth jet $p_\mathrm{T}$. However, jet quenching in heavy ion collisions modifies jet substructure, and correspondingly biases the NNs' background corrections. This study investigates those biases by using simulations of jet quenching in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200\;\mathrm{GeV}/c$ with hydrodynamically modeled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) evolution. To demonstrate the magnitude of the effect of such biases in measurement, a leading jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) is calculated and reported using the NN background correction on jets quenched utilizing a brick of QGP.

Abstract: The unusually warm sea surface temperature events known as marine heatwaves (MHWs) have a profound impact on marine ecosystems. Accurate prediction of extreme MHWs has significant scientific and financial worth. However, existing methods still have certain limitations, especially in the most extreme MHWs. In this study, to address these issues, based on the physical nature of MHWs, we created a novel deep learning neural network that is capable of accurate 10-day MHW forecasting. Our framework significantly improves the forecast ability of extreme MHWs through two specially designed modules inspired by numerical models: a coupler and a probabilistic data argumentation. The coupler simulates the driving effect of atmosphere on MHWs while the probabilistic data argumentation approaches significantly boost the forecast ability of extreme MHWs based on the idea of ensemble forecast. Compared with traditional numerical prediction, our framework has significantly higher accuracy and requires fewer computational resources. What's more, explainable AI methods show that wind forcing is the primary driver of MHW evolution and reveal its relation with air-sea heat exchange. Overall, our model provides a framework for understanding MHWs' driving processes and operational forecasts in the future.

The randomized controlled study with N = 214 students compared traditional textbook materials with explanations generated by a custom chatbot. The results demonstrated that while AI-generated materials had an indefinite impact on learning outcomes, they significantly enhanced positive-activating emotions, situational interest, and self-efficacy, while reducing intrinsic and extrinsic cognitive load. These findings underscore the potential of AI to transform educational practices by fostering a superior learning experience. However, further research is required to clarify its impact on learning performance and long-term learning outcomes.

Abstract: Over the last three decades, ensemble forecasts have become an integral part of forecasting the weather. They provide users with more complete information than single forecasts as they permit to estimate the probability of weather events by representing the sources of uncertainties and accounting for the day-to-day variability of error growth in the atmosphere. This paper presents a novel approach to obtain a weather forecast model for ensemble forecasting with machine-learning. AIFS-CRPS is a variant of the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS) developed at ECMWF. Its loss function is based on a proper score, the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). For the loss, the almost fair CRPS is introduced because it approximately removes the bias in the score due to finite ensemble size yet avoids a degeneracy of the fair CRPS. The trained model is stochastic and can generate as many exchangeable members as desired and computationally feasible in inference. For medium-range forecasts AIFS-CRPS outperforms the physics-based Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) ensemble for the majority of variables and lead times. For subseasonal forecasts, AIFS-CRPS outperforms the IFS ensemble before calibration and is competitive with the IFS ensemble when forecasts are evaluated as anomalies to remove the influence of model biases.

# Active Flow Control for Bluff Body under High Reynolds Number Turbulent Flow Conditions Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Jingbo Chen, Enrico Ballini, Stefano Micheletti

arXiv:2412.15975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for active flow control in a turbulent flow field of high Reynolds numbers at $Re=274000$. That is, an agent is trained to obtain a control strategy that can reduce the drag of a cylinder while also minimizing the oscillations of the lift. Probes are placed only around the surface of the cylinder, and a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent controls nine zero-net mass flux jets on the downstream side of the cylinder. The trained PPO agent effectively reduces drag by $29\%$ and decreases lift oscillations by $18\%$ of amplitude, with the control effect demonstrating good repeatability. Control tests of this agent within the Reynolds number range of $Re=260000$ to $288000$ show the agent's control strategy possesses a certain degree of robustness, with very similar drag reduction effects under different Reynolds numbers. Analysis using power spectral energy reveals that the agent learns specific flow frequencies in the flow field and effectively suppresses low-frequency, large-scale structures. Graphically visualizing the policy, combined with pressure, vorticity, and turbulent kinetic energy contours, reveals the mechanism by which jets achieve drag reduction by influencing reattachment vortices. This study successfully implements robust active flow control in realistically significant high Reynolds number turbulent flows, minimizing time costs (using two-dimensional geometrical models and turbulence models) and maximally considering the feasibility of future experimental implementation.

arXiv:2412.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy is a promising tool for optimally targeted treatment of spinal cord injuries (SCI), offering submillimeter precision to enhance blood flow at injury sites while minimizing impact on surrounding tissues. However, its efficacy is highly sensitive to the placement of the ultrasound source, as the spinal cord's complex geometry and acoustic heterogeneity distort and attenuate the FUS signal. Current approaches rely on computer simulations to solve the governing wave propagation equations and compute patient-specific pressure maps using ultrasound images of the spinal cord anatomy. While accurate, these high-fidelity simulations are computationally intensive, taking up to hours to complete parameter sweeps, which is impractical for real-time surgical decision-making. To address this bottleneck, we propose a convolutional deep operator network (DeepONet) to rapidly predict FUS pressure fields in patient spinal cords. Unlike conventional neural networks, DeepONets are well equipped to approximate the solution operator of the parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern the behavior of FUS waves with varying initial and boundary conditions (i.e., new transducer locations or spinal cord geometries) without requiring extensive simulations. Trained on simulated pressure maps across diverse patient anatomies, this surrogate model achieves real-time predictions with only a 2% loss on the test set, significantly accelerating the modeling of nonlinear physical systems in heterogeneous domains. By facilitating rapid parameter sweeps in surgical settings, this work provides a crucial step toward precise and individualized solutions in neurosurgical treatments.

Abstract: The acceleration of material property calculations while maintaining ab initio accuracy (1 meV/atom) is one of the major challenges in computational physics. In this paper, we introduce a Python package enhancing the computation of (finite temperature) material properties at the ab initio level using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP). The Machine-Learning Assisted Canonical Sampling (MLACS) method, grounded in a self-consistent variational approach, iteratively trains a MLIP using an active learning strategy in order to significantly reduce the computational cost of ab initio simulations.
  MLACS offers a modular and user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT) codes, MLIP potentials, and molecular dynamics packages, enabling a wide range of applications, while maintaining a near-DFT accuracy. These include sampling the canonical ensemble of a system, performing free energy calculations, transition path sampling, and geometry optimization, all by utilizing surrogate MLIP potentials, in place of ab initio calculations.
  This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and implementation of the MLACS method. We also demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency through various examples, showcasing the capabilities of the MLACS package.

# A Decision Transformer Approach to Grain Boundary Network Optimization

**Authors:** Christopher W. Adair, Oliver K. Johnson

Abstract: As microstructure property models improve, additional information from crystallographic degrees of freedom and grain boundary networks (GBNs) can be included in microstructure design problems. However, the high dimensional nature of including this information precludes the use of many common optimization approaches and requires less efficient methods to generate quality designs. Previous work demonstrated that human-in-the-loop optimization, instantiated as a video game, achieved high-quality, efficient solutions to these design problems. However, such data is expensive to obtain. In the present work, we show how a Decision Transformer machine learning (ML) model can be used to learn from the optimization trajectories generated by human players, and subsequently solve materials design problems. We compare the ML optimization trajectories against players and a common global optimization algorithm: simulated annealing (SA). We find that the ML model exhibits a validation accuracy of 84% against player decisions, and achieves solutions of comparable quality to SA (92%), but does so using three orders of magnitude fewer iterations. We find that the ML model generalizes in important and surprising ways, including the ability to train using a simple constitutive structure-property model and then solve microstructure design problems for a different, higher-fidelity, constitutive structure-property model without any retraining. These results demonstrate the potential of Decision Transformer models for the solution of materials design problems.

Abstract: Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others. Moreover, as part of this study, we explore the applicability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to turbulence modeling, assessing its potential to address non-linear mappings in the anisotropy tensor predictions and demonstrating promising results for the flat plate case.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represents an important diagnostic modality; however, its inherently slow acquisition process poses challenges in obtaining fully-sampled $k$-space data under motion. In the absence of fully-sampled acquisitions, serving as ground truths, training deep learning algorithms in a supervised manner to predict the underlying ground truth image becomes challenging. To address this limitation, self-supervised methods have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging available subsampled $k$-space data to train deep neural networks for MRI reconstruction. Nevertheless, these approaches often fall short when compared to supervised methods. We propose Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning (JSSL), a novel training approach for deep learning-based MRI reconstruction algorithms aimed at enhancing reconstruction quality in cases where target datasets containing fully-sampled $k$-space measurements are unavailable. JSSL operates by simultaneously training a model in a self-supervised learning setting, using subsampled data from the target dataset(s), and in a supervised learning manner, utilizing datasets with fully-sampled $k$-space data, referred to as proxy datasets. We demonstrate JSSL's efficacy using subsampled prostate or cardiac MRI data as the target datasets, with fully-sampled brain and knee, or brain, knee and prostate $k$-space acquisitions, respectively, as proxy datasets. Our results showcase substantial improvements over conventional self-supervised methods, validated using common image quality metrics. Furthermore, we provide theoretical motivations for JSSL and establish "rule-of-thumb" guidelines for training MRI reconstruction models. JSSL effectively enhances MRI reconstruction quality in scenarios where fully-sampled $k$-space data is not available, leveraging the strengths of supervised learning by incorporating proxy datasets.

# Generalizing Denoising to Non-Equilibrium Structures Improves Equivariant Force Fields

## 将去噪推广到非平衡结构改善等变力场

Abstract: Understanding the interactions of atoms such as forces in 3D atomistic systems is fundamental to many applications like molecular dynamics and catalyst design. However, simulating these interactions requires compute-intensive ab initio calculations and thus results in limited data for training neural networks. In this paper, we propose to use denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) as an auxiliary task to better leverage training data and improve performance. For training with DeNS, we first corrupt a 3D structure by adding noise to its 3D coordinates and then predict the noise. Different from previous works on denoising, which are limited to equilibrium structures, the proposed method generalizes denoising to a much larger set of non-equilibrium structures. The main difference is that a non-equilibrium structure does not correspond to local energy minima and has non-zero forces, and therefore it can have many possible atomic positions compared to an equilibrium structure. This makes denoising non-equilibrium structures an ill-posed problem since the target of denoising is not uniquely defined. Our key insight is to additionally encode the forces of the original non-equilibrium structure to specify which non-equilibrium structure we are denoising. Concretely, given a corrupted non-equilibrium structure and the forces of the original one, we predict the non-equilibrium structure satisfying the input forces instead of any arbitrary structures. Since DeNS requires encoding forces, DeNS favors equivariant networks, which can easily incorporate forces and other higher-order tensors in node embeddings. We study the effectiveness of training equivariant networks with DeNS on OC20, OC22 and MD17 datasets and demonstrate that DeNS can achieve new state-of-the-art results on OC20 and OC22 and significantly improve training efficiency on MD17.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant traction for simulating complex physical systems, with models like MeshGraphNet demonstrating strong performance on unstructured simulation meshes. However, these models face several limitations, including scalability issues, requirement for meshing at inference, and challenges in handling long-range interactions. In this work, we introduce X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable, multi-scale extension of MeshGraphNet designed to address these challenges. X-MeshGraphNet overcomes the scalability bottleneck by partitioning large graphs and incorporating halo regions that enable seamless message passing across partitions. This, combined with gradient aggregation, ensures that training across partitions is equivalent to processing the entire graph at once. To remove the dependency on simulation meshes, X-MeshGraphNet constructs custom graphs directly from tessellated geometry files (e.g., STLs) by generating point clouds on the surface or volume of the object and connecting k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, our model builds multi-scale graphs by iteratively combining coarse and fine-resolution point clouds, where each level refines the previous, allowing for efficient long-range interactions. Our experiments demonstrate that X-MeshGraphNet maintains the predictive accuracy of full-graph GNNs while significantly improving scalability and flexibility. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming mesh generation at inference, offering a practical solution for real-time simulation across a wide range of applications. The code for reproducing the results presented in this paper is available through NVIDIA Modulus.

# Times are changing but order matters: Transferable prediction of   small molecule liquid chromatography retention times

## 时间在变，但顺序很重要: 小分子液相色谱保留时间的可转移预测

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wd5j8?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Sebastian, Böcker

Thousands of publications on the prediction of small molecule retention times were published during the last decades. The ultimate goal is, without doubt, the transferable prediction of retention times: We want to train a model on a certain set of compounds from one dataset and then use the model to predict retention times for a different set of compounds from another dataset. Unfortunately, retention times may change massively, even for nominally identical chromatographic conditions. Retention order is much better retained, yet even the retention order of compounds may change if chromatographic conditions vary. Here, we systematically study what chromatographic conditions result in notable changes in retention order. We then present a machine learning model that can predict retention order or, more precisely, a retention order index, taking into account chromatographic conditions. Finally, we show how to map the retention order index to retention times. Disentangling these two task finally enables retention time prediction across chromatographic conditions and compound classes.

# Accounting for the Vibrational Contribution to the Configurational Entropy in Disordered Solids with Machine Learned Forcefields: A Case Study of Garnet Electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12

**Authors:** Sean, Li

Accounting for lattice vibrations to accurately determine the  phase stabilities of site-disordered solids is a long-standing challenge in computational material designs, due to the high computational cost associated with sampling the vast configurational space to obtain the converged thermodynamic quantities. One example is the garnet electrolyte  Li7La3Zr2O12, the high-temperature and high-ion-mobility cubic phase of which is disordered in its Li+ site occupations, such that both the vibrational and configurational entropic contributions to its phase stability cannot be ignored. Understanding the subtle interplay between vibrational and configurational entropies in this material will therefore play a critical role in the rational manipulation of dopants and defects to stabilise cubic  Li7La3Zr2O12 at room temperature for practical applications.  Here, by developing machine learned forcefields based on an equivariant message-passing neural network SO3krates, we follow a strict statistical thermodynamic protocol to quantify the phase stability of cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 through structural optimisations, as well as molecular dynamic simulations at 300 and 1500 K, for a total of 70,120 configurations of cubic Li7La3Zr2O12. Although this only covers a tiny fraction of the  configurational space (7x10^34 configurations in total), we are able to deterministically show  the vibrational contributions to the total configurational free energy at 1500 K are significant (on the order of 1 eV/atom) in correctly ordering the stability of the cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 over its tetragonal counterpart, thanks to the high data efficiency, accuracy, stability and good transferability of the transformer-based equivariant network architecture behind SO3krates. Therefore, our work opens up new avenue to accelerate the accurate computational designs of disordered solids, such as solid electrolytes, for technologically important applications.

**Authors:** Katherine, Nguyen

Voltammetry is widely used to detect and quantify oxidizable or reducible species in complex environments. The neurotransmitter serotonin epitomizes an analyte that is challenging to detect in situ due to low concentrations and co-existing similarly structured analytes and interferents. We developed rapid-pulse voltammetry for brain neurotransmitter monitoring due to the high information content elicited from voltage pulses. Generally, the design of voltammetry waveforms remains challenging due to prohibitively large combinatorial search spaces and a lack of design principles. Here, we illustrate how Bayesian optimization can be used to hone searches for optimized rapid pulse waveforms. Our machine-learning-guided workflow (SeroOpt) outperformed random and human-guided waveform designs and is tunable a priori to enable selective analyte detection. We interpreted the black box optimizer and found that the logic of machine-learning-guided waveform design reflected domain knowledge. Our approach is straightforward and generalizable for all single and multi-analyte problems requiring optimized electrochemical waveform solutions. Overall, SeroOpt enables data-driven exploration of the waveform design space and a new paradigm in electroanalytical method development.

**Authors:** Gang Seob, Jung

Machine learning-based interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have transformed the prediction of potential energy surfaces (PESs), achieving accuracy comparable to ab initio calculations. However, atomic energy predictions, often assumed to lack physical meaning, remain underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that inaccuracies in atomic energy predictions reduce the robustness and transferability of Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) and serve as a critical indicator of training data quality. We validate this finding using challenging configurations involving deformation and failure under tensile loading. By pre-training atomic energy predictions using empirical potentials and applying transfer learning with density functional theory (DFT) data, we achieve notable improvements in the accuracy of total energy, forces, and stress predictions. Furthermore, this approach enhances the robustness and transferability of NNPs, emphasizing the importance of atomic energy predictions in developing high-quality and reliable MLIPs.

**Authors:** Merle I. S., Röhr

Diffusion generative models, a class of machine learning techniques, have shown remarkable promise in materials science and chemistry by enabling the precise generation of complex molecular structures. In this paper, we propose a novel application of diffusion generative models for stabilizing reactive molecular structures identified through quantum mechanical screening. Specifically, we focus on the design challenge presented by Singlet Fission (SF), a phenomenon crucial for advancing solar cell efficiency beyond theoretical limits. While theoretical chemistry has been successful in predicting intermolecular arrangements with enhanced SF coupling, the practical implementation of these configurations faces challenges due to discrepancies between favorable and stabilized structures. To address this gap, we introduce a three-step strategy combining quantum mechanical screening for identifying optimal molecular arrangements and diffusion generative models for predicting stabilizing linkers. Through a case study on cibalackrot dimers, a promising SF material, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing SF efficiency by stabilizing the desired molecular arrangements.

**Authors:** Andrew I., Cooper

The physical and chemical properties of molecular crystals are a combined function of molecular structure and the molecular crystal packing. Specific crystal packings can enable applications such as pharmaceuticals, organic electronics, and porous materials for gas storage. However, to design such materials, we need to predict both crystal structure and the resulting physical properties, and this is expensive using traditional computational methods. Machine-learned interatomic potential methods offer major accelerations here, but molecular crystal structure prediction remains challenging due to the weak intermolecular interactions that dictate crystal packing. Moreover, machine-learned interatomic potentials do not accelerate the prediction of all physical properties for molecular crystals. Here we present Molecular Crystal Representation from Transformers (MCRT), a transformer-based model for molecular crystal property prediction that is pre-trained on more than 700,000 experimental structures extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). MCRT employs four different pre-training tasks to extract both local and global representations from the crystals using multimodal features to encode crystal structure and geometry. MCRT has the potential to serve as a universal foundation model for predicting a range of properties for molecular crystals, achieving state-of-the-art results even when fine-tuned on small-scale datasets. We demonstrate MCRT’s practical utility in both crystal property prediction and crystal structure prediction. We also show that model predictions can be interpreted by using attention scores.

In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), accurately detecting accidents and identifying the vehicles involved is crucial for assessing accident severity. This paper focuses on the challenge of vehicle identification in accidents on Indian roads. We introduce a hierarchical detection model where an image is first analyzed for accident detection, and if an accident is detected, it is further processed to identify the involved vehicles in collision. We implemented various YOLOv8 model variants for accident and vehicle detection, finding that YOLOv8m performed best with an F1-score of 0.824 for accident detection and 0.827 for vehicle detection. The outputs of these detection units are integrated to identify collided vehicles, achieving an F1-score of 0.716 for this task.

Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major global cardiovascular health threat and the leading cause of death in many countries. The disease has a significant impact in China, where it has become the leading cause of death. More than 200 studies have evaluated depression as a risk factor for cardiac events in patients with established CAD. There is an urgent need to develop objective, simple, and cost-effective techniques for the detection of potential depression in CAD patients using machine learning (ML).Methods 228 participants were divided into three groups: healthy, CAD, and depressed CAD. The raw data of pulse wave from those participants was collected. The data were de-noised, normalized, and analyzed using several applications. Seven ML classifiers were used to model the processed data, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Extra Trees (ET), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM), and Unbiased Boosting with Categorical Features (CatBoost).Results The ET classifier demonstrated the best classification performance. After tuning hyperparameters, the results performance evaluation on test set are: 0.8261 accuracy, 0.9187 AUC, 0.8245 recall, 0.8255 precision, 0.825 F1-score, and 0.7398 MCC. The top 10 feature importances of tuned ET model are hf/4, t3/tmax, tf/6/t4, tf/5, t4/tmax, tmax/t, w, As, t4/t1, t3/t1. The top 20 features of SHAP value are: t3/tmax, tf/6/t4, hf/4, t3/t1, t4/tmax, tf/5, w/tmax, w/t1, w, tmax/t, t4/t1, hf/3, t5/tmax, As, hf/5, hf/6, tf/3/tmax, tf/6/t1, tf/4/t1, and h4.Conclusion Radial artery pulse wave can be used to identify healthy, CAD and depressed CAD participants by using ET classifier.

# Identification and Validation of Autophagy-Related Genes in Osteoarthritis through Bioinformatics and Machine Learning

## 基于生物信息学和机器学习的骨关节炎自噬相关基因的鉴定与验证

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5617353/latest

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disease affecting the elderly worldwide. Although increasing evidence suggests a close relationship between autophagy and OA, its pathogenesis remains unclear. This study aimed to identify autophagy-related genes in OA using bioinformatics and machine learning methods. Three OA datasets (GSE55235, GSE55457 and GSE12021) were retrieved from the GEO database for differential analysis. Subsequently, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were intersected with autophagy-related genes to identify differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (DEARGs), which were then subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Subsequently, potential key genes were selected using three machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVM and RF) and their diagnostic accuracy was validated using an external dataset (GSE114007) to determine the key genes. Next, potential interactions between the key genes were predicted using the GeneMANIA database. Additionally, immune cell infiltration analysis was performed to explore the correlation between the key genes and immune cells. Finally, the expression levels of the key genes were further validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In this study, a total of 27 DEARGs were identified. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these DEARGs might be associated with pathways related to cellular immunity, autophagy, and inflammation. Four potential key genes were selected through the use of three machine learning algorithms. Notably, validation with the external dataset revealed that the expression levels of PPP1R15A, GABARAPL1 and FOXO3 were significantly downregulated in OA and exhibited strong diagnostic performance. Immune infiltration analysis showed that PPP1R15A, GABARAPL1 and FOXO3 were positively correlated with activated mast cells and resting memory CD4&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;T cells, but negatively correlated with plasma cells and M0 macrophages. Finally, qRT-PCR confirmed these results, which were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis.In conclusion, this study identifies PPP1R15A, GABARAPL1 and FOXO3 as autophagy key genes in OA, providing potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of OA.

Oil and gas wells frequently encounter the issue of drilling fluid loss circulation as drilling progresses, leading to significant complications and expenses. Effective prediction of mud loss during drilling is crucial for optimizing the selection of loss circulation materials (LCMs), improving drilling efficiency, and reducing costs and risks. This study evaluates an ensemble method comprising five machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree (DT), Linear Regressor (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), and Random Forest (RF). Hyperparameters for these algorithms were fine-tuned using genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization to achieve optimal performance (R&sup2; close to 1).The ensemble method (DT, LR, KNN, GBR) achieved the highest prediction accuracy with R&sup2; = 0.969 and RMSE = 15.89. The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm showed the least performance with an R&sup2; of 0.519. Effective hyperparameter tuning using various optimization techniques significantly improved model performance. The purpose of this article is to apply Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to fine-tune the hyperparameters of an ensemble of machine learning (ML) models, thereby enhancing their predictive accuracy for mud loss. These methods offer a lower computational volume compared to deep learning techniques and simultaneously provide high execution speed.

Background This study presents a novel approach to educational role-playing through an AI-based bot, leveraging GPT-4 to simulate anamnesis interviews in various learning scenarios. Developed collaboratively by an interdisciplinary team of university lecturers, the bot provides a platform for students of different health study programs to engage in complex patient-health professional conversations, offering an alternative to traditional role plays with actors or real patients.
Methods This study utilized a GPT-4 based digital teaching assistant to train anamnesis interviews in virtual settings with students from different online health care study programs. Student&rsquo;s satisfaction, virtual patient&rsquo;s accuracy, its realism, and quality was evaluated with a quantitative survey.
Results The evaluation of the bot focused on student feedback, highlighting a preference for the AI-driven method due to its immersive and interactive nature. Preliminary results show that students consistently rate the language ability of the AI model positively. More than 80% of students rated the professional and content-related precision of the virtual patient as good to excellent. Even as a text-based chatbot, the vast majority of students see a fairly close to very close relationship to a real anamnesis interview. The results further indicate that students even prefer this training approach to traditional in-person role-plays.
Conclusions The study underscores the bot's potential as a versatile tool for enriching learning experiences across multiple health disciplines, signaling a meaningful shift in educational practices towards the integration of AI technologies.

# The underlying molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of Hip fracture combined with deep vein thrombosis based on self sequencing bioinformatics analysis

## 基于自测序生物信息学分析髋部骨折合并深静脉血栓的分子机制及生物标志物

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5092399/latest

Background: Thrombus formation is a severe complication in orthopedic surgery, significantly increasing mortality in patients with fractures. Therefore, identifying feature genes to determine thrombus presence in fracture surgeries is critical.
Methods: Whole blood samples were collected from 18 patients with fractures with thrombosis (YES_thrombus) and 18 patients with fractures without thrombosis (NO_thrombus) from the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, China, and used for transcriptome sequencing and quality control to generate the YES_thrombus dataset. Candidate genes were identified by overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with key module genes from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Functional enrichment analysis was then performed to explore the roles of the candidate genes. Feature genes were further refined by intersecting results from three machine learning algorithms and constructing an artificial neural network (ANN). Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Additionally, single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted, and correlations between feature genes and differential immune cells were analyzed. The ceRNA regulatory network for feature genes was also constructed. Finally, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to validate gene expression.
Results: Seven candidate genes were selected, with functional enrichment analysis linking them to the autophagosome and PPAR signaling pathways. Five feature genes with excellent diagnostic performance were identified. Single-gene GSEA enrichment showed that the feature genes were primarily associated with the cytosolic ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation. The correlation analysis revealed that aDC exhibited the strongest negative correlation with WDR81 and the strongest positive correlation with RGS1. The ceRNA regulatory network encompassed three feature genes, five miRNAs, and 236 lncRNAs. Expression analysis indicated that, with the exception of WDR81, other genes were significantly upregulated in the NO_thrombus group. qRT-PCR validation confirmed that the expression of AAED1, ARL4A, and WDR81 matched sequencing results.
Conclusions: In conclusion, five feature genes (RGS1, HSF2, ARL4A, AAED1, and WDR81) were identified, and functional enrichment analyses were conducted, providing a foundation for predicting the diagnosis of fractures associated with thrombosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by a loss in cognitive functions, with no disease-modifying medication now available. It is crucial for early detection and treatment of Alzheimer's disease before clinical manifestation. The stage between cognitively healthy older persons and AD is known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To predict the transition from one-stage MCI to probable AD, five ensemble learning approach was used (Stacking, Gradient boost Bagging, Adaptive boost and Voting), an integrated model that combines not only cross-sectional neuroimaging biomarkers at baseline but also longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cognitive performance biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI). The adaptive boost, stacking and bagging ensemble approach has shown potential to identify those at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, this would benefit them the most from a clinical trial or to use as a stratification approach inside clinical trials.

# Evaluating the Quality of Data: Case of Sarcasm Dataset

## 评估数据质量: Sarcasm数据集的案例

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5678459/latest

The models of artificial intelligence (AI) rely on data as their primary fuel. Accurate and efficient AI models that generated by high-quality data may guarantee AI-safe use. Sentiment analysis (SA), one of the tasks in natural language processing (NLP), highly relies on sarcasm detection. Sarcasm&amp;rsquo;s cryptic character, however, makes it difficult and degrades its quality. Even though the problem was thoroughly investigated, it has been limited by the restrictions resulting from improper labeling and data not specifically gathered to identify sarcasm. This paper evaluates the quality of the sarcasm data by the performance of similarly parameterized models. To make an analysis, we compiled four distinct datasets&amp;mdash;SARC, SemEval2022, NewsHeadline, and Multimodal. Undersampling and over-sampling techniques were used to balance the data size as well as class-label variations among the corpora. We perform extensive and fair evaluations on various models ranging from machine learning to transfer learning algorithms and employ TF-IDF vectorization and word embedding text representation techniques. Based on the experimental result, the NewsHeadline corpus exhibited greater quality, achieving a notable F1 score of 0.93 in RoBERTa&amp;rsquo;s model performance. We have created a new (Sarcasm-Quality) dataset combining the best-performing datasets based on the experimental analysis and made it available for public use.

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5619112/latest

This study explores the capability of passive digital sensor data from smartphones and smartwatches to predict self-reported ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of affect, motivation, interest, and pleasure in activities in an unseen test sample. Using data from 245 depressed participants with high-to-low anhedonia (195 train, 50 test) generating 23,812 EMA sessions, we evaluated whether behaviors and physiological factors could detect subjective states. For 11 of 15 EMA questions asked, machine learning models exceeded random chance in the fully-held-out test sample, suggesting detectable signals between passive measures and subjective states. Dependent on the sensor type, the optimal aggregation periods ranged from 15 minutes to 3 hours, with generally at least two hours of data being required. Subgroup analyses revealed variations in model performance by demographics, depression severity, and anhedonia severity. These findings demonstrate the potential for passive digital sensing to help monitor aspects of mental health on a large scale.

## Ms-unet: 一种用于皮肤病变分割的轻量级多尺度UNet

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5299030/latest

In recent years, transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely employed in medical image segmentation due to their excellent feature extraction capabilities. However, the computational requirements imposed by the large number of model parameters have posed significant limitations on the practical applications of these models.In this paper, we propose a lightweight Multi-Scale UNet(MS-UNet), which significantly reduces the number of model parameters. Simultaneously, the model maintains high accuracy through the utilization of depth-wise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion modules.Moreover, an improved pyramid convolution(PConv) is employed in encoders, while utilizing different strip convolutions in decoders to extract features of different scales.Experimental results demonstrate that MS-UNet achieves the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with very low parameters and computation cost.Specifically, our MS-UNet has only 23.7K parameters and 78.3M GFLOPs on the ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 datasets, compared with EGE-UNet which is the first model with a parameter size within 50KB.

# Enhancing perinatal brain maturity estimation using surface deep learning and cross-modal relationship inference technology

## 使用表面深度学习和跨模态关系推理技术增强围产期脑成熟度估计

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5636908/latest

Neonates with marked brain developmental delays are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Brain chronological age is a valuable biomarker for assessing abnormal maturation in developing brains; however, accurately estimating brain age at birth remains challenging. In this study, we introduce a cross-modal relationship inference network (CMRINet) that integrates structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data to improve the accuracy of neonatal brain age estimation. The CMRINet employs a Transformer encoder and relational inference module to capture both the long- and short-range dependencies of multimodal features among cortical parcels. Our model outperformed others in predicting neonatal brain age, achieving a mean squared error of 0.51 and a mean absolute error of 0.55 on the test set. By applying the model trained on full-term neonates to preterm infants at term-equivalent age, we found that the predicted age was significantly lower than the chronological age, suggesting delayed development in preterm brains. Furthermore, the deviation of predicted age was significantly associated with long-term motor development of preterm infants. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the CMRINet for neonatal brain age estimation, with potential clinical utility in early detection of neurodevelopmental risks during the perinatal period.

## 基于机器学习的寒地老年人群急性脑卒中风险预测模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5594368/latest

Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) profoundly affects the health and quality of life of elderly individuals, with stroke being its most prevalent manifestation, characterized by high incidence, disability, and mortality rates. In Northeast China, harsh winter conditions further exacerbate the risk of stroke. This study leverages machine learning (ML) to develop a predictive model for assessing acute stroke risk among the elderly in cold regions, aiming to enable early identification of high-risk individuals.Significant risk factors for acute stroke onset were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression (LR) analyses. Input variables were selected based on expert clinical recommendations and a comprehensive literature review. Three machine learning algorithms&amp;mdash;LR, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest (RF)&amp;mdash;were compared for their clinical prediction performance, with the best-performing algorithm used to construct the risk prediction model. A line chart was employed to visualize the probability of acute stroke in this population.The findings highlight diabetes history, coronary heart disease(CHD), systolic blood pressure(SBP), neutrophil count(NEUT#), total bile acid (TBA), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and homocysteine(Hcy) as independent risk factors for acute stroke in elderly individuals in cold regions. In contrast, prealbumin(PA), albumin (ALB), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) emerged as potential protective factors. The LR-based model developed in this study demonstrated robust performance in predicting acute stroke risk, providing accurate and individualized risk assessments for the target population.

The cryptocurrency market has been subject to various forms of exploitation, with pump-and-dump schemes being a persistent problem that can lead to significant price volatility and financial losses. Prior studies have focused on predicting attack targets using machine learning approaches; however, these methods are often compromised by class imbalance and biases inherent in historical data. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework for manipulation targets prediction.
We employ two-step bias-minimizing data normalization techniques to mitigate the effects of class imbalance and temporal heterogeneity. We also propose several innovative machine learning approaches including imbalance-aware hyperparameters optimization and ranking algorithms.
Our evaluation reveals that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods, achieving an accuracy rate of 5\% and a top-10 accuracy rate of 45\% on a highly imbalanced dataset of historical P\&amp;Ds events(imbalance ratio $\approx$ 270). 
For further validation, we construct a portfolio strategy based on predicted target class probabilities to assess the practical application of our constructed models.

## 使用人工智能模型YOLO-V8x的真实口腔内照片检查学龄儿童的新临床龋齿

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5657504/latest

Background Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases in school-aged children, with a prevalence above 80% in Indonesia. Traditional diagnostic practices are time-consuming and dependent on the number of healthcare professionals available, and as such, have led to the creation of AI-based alternatives, such as the HI Bogi application. This research used the YOLO-v8 model to assist in the detection of dental caries, which is faster, more efficient, and highly accurate, and can be developed to enhance existing dental health programs in schools in IndonesiaMaterials and Methods A dataset of 3,221 JPG images labeled using the ICDAS D0 to D1 method was prepared and processed using Roboflow labeling software, and the images were resized to 640&amp;times;640 pixels to standardize the input for model training. The dataset was divided into training (2,266 images), validation (635 images), and testing (320 images) subsets. The YOLOv8x algorithm was used for deep learning and the performance of the model was evaluated using confusion matrix analysis to calculate True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN) values. Statistical Mann&amp;ndash;Whitney tests were conducted to compare the classification accuracy between the AI model and dentists across the ICDAS categories, whereas a diagnostic speed test assessed the efficiency of the AI model relative to dentists.Results The YOLO-v8 model showed encouraging results, with a recall of 41.1%, accuracy of 72.6%, and mAP of 45.8%. P-values of 0.301 for D1, 0.690 for D2, 0.621 for D3, 0.693 for D4, 0.634 for D5, and 0.302 for D6 were obtained from comparative testing with dentists. These results showed no significant variations in the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, or NPV among the ICDAS categories (p&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;0.05). Furthermore, AI performed much faster than the dentists during the examinations (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.000). AI may improve the efficiency and efficacy of early caries diagnosis as demonstrated by these findings.Conclusion The YOLO-v8 model integrated into the application showed promising results in early caries detection, comparable to those of dentists across all ICDAS criteria. AI significantly outperformed dentists in terms of examination speed and completed tasks four times faster. Future research should explore transformer-based models to improve accuracy and expand the datasets to enhance the ability of the model to identify diverse caries categories, including rare lesions.

# Adaptive hybrid potential evapotranspiration (PET) prediction method based on automatic machine learning

## 基于自动机器学习的自适应混合潜在蒸散量 (PET) 预测方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5657062/latest

In arid areas, estimation of crop water demand through potential evapotranspiration (PET) forecast has a guiding effect on water-saving irrigation, to cope with the crisis of water shortage. Neural network-based PET prediction methods is considered to have huge application potential because of its small prediction error. However, the physical conditions and data quality in different regions make the choice of neural network different, making it difficult to provide a general PET prediction method. So an adaptive hybrid model based on automatic machine learning for short-term PET prediction is proposed coupling neural network and PET formula. Process is divided into two stages: learning and forecasting. Learning stage includes three modules: meteorological data reconstructing, adaptive data set generation and adaptive hybrid model (PET calculation formula + neural network) selecting. Forecast stage includes two modules: adaptive data set generation and rolling prediction. 105 standard weather stations in Xinjiang were used as data sets (43 of them had missing data) to test model. According to modules, networks and PET formulas used in the prediction process, corresponding labels were generated in each dataset forecast result. Ratio of training set and test set for each data set was 8:2. Grid search was used to optimize the best hyperparameter combination. In test set, the average absolute error (MAE) and average squared error (MSE) of the model prediction were 0.338mm and 0.270, achieving high prediction accuracy. The mean prediction error is smaller to any single mixed model. We demonstrate that the neural network applicability varies among the used data sources, and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) and 1 Dimension convolutional neural network (1DCNN) are more suitable for the selected datasets, while Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) are not applicable. Combined with the analysis of the labels, We find evidences that applicability of neural networks and PET formulas is independent of geographic region and degree of drought. In 2023, method of rolling prediction for 1-15 days is verified, and the verification results show that PET prediction error based on neural network is significantly smaller than useing weather forecast data to calculate PET. In addition, by comparison,we determined that adaptive input length can effectively reduce the prediction error, MAE was 27.52% smaller than fixed input length, and MSE was 45.76% smaller than fixed input length. The proposed method realized the automatic machine learning of PET forecast, can predict PET more accurately, and can be further expanded by adding neural networks and PET formulas to improve its generalization ability.

This study aims to develop an Automated Data Processing (ADP) framework that automatically processes multimodal data for machine learning (ML) diagnostics of manufacturing processes. The objective is to contribute to the state-of-the-art Automated ML (AutoML) domain by developing a novel all-in-one ML development framework that automatically processes data, trains ML models, and conducts evaluation based on prior process-based knowledge. For this purpose, the ADP framework was designed based on a higher level decision making unit and a lower level machine learning unit to select the best set of data processing methods, ML models, and training strategies, defined as policies, for the machine tool monitoring. The ADP framework was tested with data collected from orthogonal tube turning experiments for cutting tool wear classification. The data were gathered using acceleration, acoustics, and temperature sensors mounted on a Computer Numerical Controller (CNC) lathe machine. The results demonstrate that the solutions selected by the ADP framework consistently exhibited similar performance as the global optimal policy with improved computational efficiency. Consequently, the proposed ADP framework was demonstrated to automatically conduct multiple steps within the ML development process without manual intervention for tool condition monitoring to facilitate democratization of ML development for manufacturers.

# Forecasting the spatiotemporal evolution of fluid-induced microearthquakes with deep learning

## 基于深度学习的流体诱发微地震时空演化预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5575976/latest

Microearthquakes (MEQs) produced by subsurface fluid injection record the spatial and temporal evolution of stress and permeability. Hence, the ability to forecast the spatiotemporal evolution of fluid-induced microseimicity is crucial for guiding applications such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and CO2 sequestration. We present a transformer-based deep learning approach for predicting the spatiotemporal evolution of MEQs. The model is trained on hydraulic stimulation history and monitored MEQ events from the EGS Collab field experiment data. Our transformer network accurately forecasts MEQ occurrences, energy release, and spatial extent, even for unseen datasets. Notably, the predicted spatial extents after the fluid injection period were within 0.36 meters of observed values, demonstrating the model's robustness in capturing the spatial characteristics of fluid-induced seismicity. These results underscore the significant potential of deep learning approaches to accurately forecast MEQs, ultimately improving risk assessment, guiding mitigation strategies, and optimizing well placement in future geo-engineering operations.

# A federated graph learning method to multi-party collaboration for molecular discovery

## 一种用于分子发现的多方协作的联邦图学习方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5546931/latest

Optimizing molecular resources utilization for molecular discovery requires collaborative efforts across research institutions to accelerate progress. However, given the high research value of both successful and unsuccessful molecules conducted by each institution (or laboratory), these findings are typically kept private and confidential until formal publication, with failed ones rarely disclosed. This confidentiality requirement presents a great challenge for most existing methods when handing molecular data with heterogeneous distributions under stringent privacy constraints. Here, we propose FedLG, a federated graph learning method that leverages the Lanczos algorithm to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple parties, achieving reliable prediction performance under strict privacy protection conditions. Compared with various traditional federate learning methods, FedLG method exhibits excellent model performance on all benchmark datasets. With different privacy-preserving mechanism settings, FedLG method demonstrates potential application with high robustness and noise resistance. Comparison tests on datasets from each simulated research institution also show that FedLG method effectively achieves superior data aggregation capabilities and more promising outcomes than localized model training. In addition, we incorporate the Bayesian optimization algorithm into FedLG method to demonstrate its scalability and further enhance model performance. Overall, the proposed method FedLG can be deemed a highly effective method to realize multi-party collaboration while ensuring sensitive molecular information is protected from potential leakage.

# Experimental study and model prediction of the influence of different factors on the mechanical properties of saline clay

## 不同因素对盐渍黏土力学性质影响的试验研究及模型预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5108719/latest

Water conveyance open channels in cold and arid regions pass through several saline-alkali soil areas. Canal water leakage exacerbates the salt expansion traits of such soil, damaging canal slope lining structures. To investigate saline clay's mechanical property variations, this study conducts indoor tests, including direct shear, compression, permeation, and scanning electron microscopy analysis on soil samples from typical sites. The study aims to elucidate the impact of various factors on saline clay's mechanical properties from a macro-micro perspective and unveil its physical mechanisms. A prediction model is formulated and validated. Findings indicate: (1) Cohesion in direct shear tests exhibits a linear negative correlation with water content, a positive correlation with dry density, and initially decreases with salt content until 2%, after which it increases. The internal friction angle initially rises and then falls with increasing water content, reaching a peak at optimal water content, and gradually increases with dry density while exhibiting an initial decrease followed by an increase in salt content, stabilizing thereafter. Water content, dry density, or salt content chiefly affect cohesion by influencing electrostatic attraction, van der Waals force, particle cementation, and valence bonds at particle contact points. (2) Compression tests reveal a linear positive correlation between compression coefficient and water content, a negative correlation with dry density, and a stage-wise linear correlation with salt content, peaking at 2%. The compression index declines with increasing water content and dry density, following a trend similar to that of compression coefficient with salt content increase. The rebound index shows a linear negative correlation with water content and dry density, transitioning from a negative to a positive correlation at 2% salt content. Scanning electron microscopy analysis indicates particle flattening and increased aggregation with rising consolidation pressure, reducing compressibility. Large pores and three-dimensional porosity have the greatest influence on soil compressibility. (3) Permeability tests reveal an exponential negative correlation between permeability coefficient and dry density. As dry density rises, particle arrangement becomes denser, decreasing pore quantity, with small pores disproportionately impacting the permeability coefficient. Salinity increase initially boosts the permeability coefficient before a decline. The boundary point of 2% salt content divides salt ions' effect from promoting free water flow to blocking seepage channels, with micropores' pro-portion being the primary influencing factor. (4) Employing statistical theory and machine learning algorithms, dry density, water content, and salinity are used to predict mechanical index values. The improved PSO-SVR model exhibits high accuracy and general applicability. These findings offer insights for the construction and upkeep of open channel projects in arid regions.
