<span class="paragraphSection">Water confined in nanoscale cavities plays a crucial role in everyday phenomena in geology and biology, as well as technological applications at the water–energy nexus. However, even understanding the basic properties of nano-confined water is extremely challenging for theory, simulations, and experiments. In particular, determining the melting temperature of quasi-one-dimensional ice polymorphs confined in carbon nanotubes has proven to be an exceptionally difficult task, with previous experimental and classical simulation approaches reporting values ranging from ∼180 K up to ∼450 K at ambient pressure. In this work, we use a machine learning potential that delivers first principles accuracy (trained to the density functional theory approximation revPBE0-D3) to study the phase diagram of water for confinement diameters 9.5 &lt; <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span> &lt; 12.5 Å. We find that several distinct ice polymorphs melt in a surprisingly narrow range between ∼280 and ∼310 K, with a melting mechanism that depends on the nanotube diameter. These results shed new light on the melting of ice in one-dimension and have implications for the operating conditions of carbon-based filtration and desalination devices.</span>

# Illuminating new and known relations between knot invariants

**Authors:** Jessica Craven, Mark Hughes, Vishnu Jejjala and Arjun Kar

We automate the process of machine learning correlations between knot invariants. For nearly 200 000 distinct sets of input knot invariants together with an output invariant, we attempt to learn the output invariant by training a neural network on the input invariants. Correlation between invariants is measured by the accuracy of the neural network prediction, and bipartite or tripartite correlations are sequentially filtered from the input invariant sets so that experiments with larger input sets are checking for true multipartite correlation. We rediscover several known relationships between polynomial, homological, and hyperbolic knot invariants, while also finding novel correlations which are not explained by known results in knot theory. These unexplained correlations strengthen previous observations concerning links between Khovanov and knot Floer homology. Our results also point to a new connection between quantum algebraic and hyperbolic invariants, similar to the generalized volume conjecture.

# A Machine-Learned "Chemical Intuition" to Overcome Spectroscopic Data Scarcity

## 克服光谱数据稀缺的机器学习 “化学直觉”

**Authors:** W. Scott, Hopkins

Machine learning models for predicting IR spectra of molecular ions (infrared ion spectroscopy, IRIS) have yet to be reported owing to the relatively sparse experimental datasets available. To overcome this limitation, we employ the Graphormer-IR model for neutral molecules as a knowledgeable starting point, then employ transfer learning to refine the model to predict the spectra of gaseous ions. A library of 10,336 computed spectra and a small dataset of 312 experimental IRIS spectra is used for model fine-tuning. Nonspecific global graph encodings that describe the molecular charge state (i.e., (de)protonation, sodiation), combined with an additional transfer learning step that considers computed spectra for ions, improved model performance. The resulting Graphormer-IRIS model yields spectra that are 21% more accurate than those produced by commonly employed DFT quantum chemical models, while capturing subtle phenomena such as spectral red-shifts due to sodiation. Dimensionality reduction of model embeddings demonstrate derived “chemical intuition” of functional groups, trends in molecular electron density, and the location of charge sites.  Our approach will enable fast IRIS predictions for determining the structures of unknown small molecule analytes (e.g., metabolites, lipids) present in biological samples.

# Autoparty: Machine Learning-Guided Visual Inspection of Molecular Docking Results

## Autoparty: 机器学习引导的分子对接结果可视化检测

**Authors:** Alan M., Mathiowetz

Human inspection of potential drug compounds is crucial in the virtual drug screening pipeline. However, there is a pressing need to accelerate this process, as the number of molecules humans can realistically examine is extremely limited relative to the scale of virtual screens. Furthermore, computational medicinal chemists can evaluate different poses inconsistently, and there is no standard way of recording annotations. We propose Autoparty, a containerized tool to address these challenges. Autoparty leverages on-premises active learning for drug discovery to facilitate human-in-the-loop training of models that extrapolate human intuition. We leverage multiple uncertainty quantification metrics to query the user with informative examples for model training, limiting the number of human expert training labels. The collected annotations populate a persistent and exportable local database for broad downstream uses. Incorporating Autoparty doubled the hit rate among 193 experimentally tested compounds in a real-world case study.

# Including physics-informed atomization constraints in neural networks for reactive chemistry

## 在用于反应化学的神经网络中包括物理通知的雾化约束

**Authors:** Nicholas, Lubbers

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools for investigating atomistic systems with high accuracy and relatively low computational cost. However, a common challenge with current MLIPs is their limited ability to accurately predict the relative energies of systems containing isolated or nearly isolated atoms, which often appear in various chemical processes. To address this limitation, we present a technique for modifying existing neural network architectures in a minimal way which accounts for the energies of isolated atoms and the atomization energy (AE) of a system. Using this technique, we build a model architecture we call HIP-NN-AE, an enhanced version of the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network (HIP-NN). Our results demonstrate that the HIP-NN-AE model significantly outperforms the previous HIP-NN model in multiple scenarios involving isolated atoms, such as complete atomization and bond dissociation processes. We also show that this innovation does not compromise the model performance on other tasks, including barrier height and conformational energy variation. The HIP-NN-AE model thus offers a robust solution to the challenges posed by isolated atoms in energy prediction tasks.

## CT引导下肺活检中明胶海绵对减少肺出血的影响: 倾向评分匹配分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4937450/latest

Background: Gelatin sponges are widely used as embolic agents to reduce bleeding in various surgical procedures. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of gelatin sponges in decreasing pulmonary bleeding during CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (PTNB).
Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Henan Cancer Hospital, including patients who underwent PTNB from January to December 2022. Patients were categorized based on the use of gelatin sponges. Propensity score matching generated 1052 matched pairs, and machine learning models were utilized to predict the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage.
Results: A total of 1826 patients (mean age 64 &plusmn; 10 years; 986 men) were analyzed. The use of gelatin sponges resulted in a 6.46% reduction in severe pulmonary hemorrhage compared to the non-gelatin sponge group (p = 0.034). Logistic regression identified gelatin sponges as a significant protective factor (coefficient: -0.28, p = 0.029).
Conclusions: Gelatin sponges significantly reduce the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage in PTNB procedures, suggesting a potential improvement in patient safety and clinical outcomes.

## 结合迁移学习和贝叶斯优化的快速学习网络，使用乳腺超声图像进行乳腺癌分类

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5333695/latest

Background Breast cancer remains the most frequent cancer diagnosed in females, resulting in high mortality rates worldwide. Approximately 2.3&amp;nbsp;million cases are diagnosed annually. If it is detected at an early stage, the rate of survival is significantly improved; therefore, there is an urgent need for techniques that can be used for its effective diagnosis.Method The study aimed to present a hybrid model for breast cancer classification by employing DenseNet201 as a feature extractor and Bayesian-Optimized Fast Learning Network (FLN) as a classifier. The pre-trained DenseNet201 extracts high-quality features from breast ultrasound images on large datasets, which get classified through an FLN optimized using Bayesian techniques for hyperparameter tuning.Results The model performed well by achieving an accuracy of 96.79%, 94.71% F1 score, 96.81% precision, and 93.48% recall, while the AUC for benign, malignant, and normal cases was found to be 0.96, 0.95, and 0.98, respectively. Cross-entropy loss metrics further validated the model on its robust training and validation.Conclusion There is a great potential that this proposed model could enhance breast cancer diagnosis. This indeed is a reliable and efficient clinical solution for application.

# Quantitative Measurement of Iris Melanin Content by Polarization-Sensitive Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomograph

## 偏振敏感眼前节光学相干断层扫描仪定量测量虹膜黑色素含量

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5379311/latest

Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate iris melanin content utilizing polarization-sensitive anterior segment optical coherence tomography (PS-AS-OCT) and explore its correlation with iris color in brown-eye individuals.
Methods: Iris cross-sections were imaged using PS-AS-OCT and the iris substructural layers were automatically segmented by the deep learning network. The iris melanin content of each iris layers was evaluated by melanin concentration rate (MCR) from PS-AS-OCT images. The iris color measurements were extracted in the CIE L*a*b* (CIELAB) color space from the iris surface photographs. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between iris MCR parameters and iris L*a*b* values. Additionally,traditional three-category grading was also used for comparisons of parameters among three iris color categories and to examine the accuracy of iris color clustering using iris MCR parameters by the KNN model.
Results: The analysis included 88 participants with a mean age of 39 years (range 18&ndash;64 years). We observed a significant negative correlation between melanin concentration rate (MCR) of the whole iris and particularly the iris stroma layers with iris color in L*a*b* values. A higher MCR of the iris stroma was correlated with darker colors, exhibiting lower L* (r=-0.72, P&amp;lt;0.001), a* (r=-0.56, P&amp;lt;0.001), and b* (r=-0.68, P&amp;lt;0.001) values. The MCR of the iris stroma also shows significant differences among the three grades (P&amp;lt;0.001). For the classification of the iris color grading by iris stroma MCR, the accuracy for the KNN model reached 85%.
Conclusions: The MCR of the iris stroma, as measured by PS-AS-OCT, demonstrated a strong correlation with iris color. This suggests the feasibility of assessing iris melanin content using PS-AS-OCT, which may offer an additional avenue for investigating iris pigment.

# Classification of schizophrenia spectrum disorder using machine learning and functional connectivity: reconsidering the clinical application

## 使用机器学习和功能连接对精神分裂症谱系障碍进行分类: 重新考虑临床应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5400516/latest

Background Early identification of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD) is crucial for effective intervention and prognosis improvement. Previous neuroimaging-based classifications have primarily focused on chronic, medicated SSD cohorts. However, the question remains whether brain metrics identified in these populations can serve as trait biomarkers for early-stage SSD. This study investigates whether brain metrics identified in chronic, medicated SSD can function as trait biomarkers for early-stage SSD.Methods Data were collected from 502 SSD patients and 575 healthy controls (HCs) across four medical institutions. Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) features were used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on individuals with medicated chronic SSD and HCs from three sites. The remaining site, comprising both chronic medicated and first-episode unmedicated SSD patients, was used for independent validation. A univariable analysis examined the association between medication dosage or illness duration and FC.Results The classifier achieved 69% accuracy (P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;2.86e-13), 63% sensitivity, and 75% specificity when tested on an independent dataset. Subgroup analysis showed 71% sensitivity (P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;4.63e-05) for chronic medicated SSD, but poor generalization to first-episode unmedicated SSD (sensitivity&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;48%, P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.68). Univariable analysis revealed a significant association between FC and medication usage, but not disease duration.Conclusions Classifiers developed on chronic medicated SSD may predominantly capture state features of chronicity and medication, overshadowing potential SSD traits. This partially explains the current classifiers' non-generalizability across SSD patients with different clinical states, underscoring the need for models that can enhance the early detection of schizophrenia neural pathology.

# Machine Learning to classify the Depth of Reflection in STEM Student Writings&nbsp;

## 机器学习对STEM学生写作中的反思深度进行分类

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5408888/latest

Assessing &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;reflective writing is essential for students&rsquo; learning. There is a growing &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;need to improve the evaluation of reflective writing skills that students can &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;organise their thoughts into a logical structure and connect new information &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with existing knowledge. However, manually analysing reflective writing is &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;time-consuming and subjective, and there is a need for automation to make the &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;process more reliable.
This &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;study aims to investigate the potential use of machine learning and natural &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;language processing to enhance the assessing process of reflective writing. In &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;order to explore this research gap. &amp;nbsp;Firstly, the study investigates of seven &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;reflection indicators in terms of Natural &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Language Processing (NLP) into four groups of feature extraction (n-grams, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PoS n-grams, sentiment features, and WordNet-Affect features) according to &amp;nbsp;Reflective Writing Framework (RWF). Secondly, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the automated RWF investigates of NLP&rsquo;s &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;findings with a wide range of machine learning algorithms to detect the &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;reflection levels in text.
The &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;study showed that the evaluation of the automated reflective writing analysis &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is reliable and valid, as measured by Cohen&rsquo;s &kappa; ranged from 0.46 to 0.75 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;across the seven indicators and 0.40 and 0.72 for the three reflection &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;levels, demonstrating moderate to substantial agreement.
This &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;research sheds light on important parts that need to be considered when &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;attempting to improve the automated assessment of reflective writing. The &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;contribution of this research is represented by the new knowledge it unearths &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;related to reflection and its automated assessment using machine learning &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;techniques.

# Rapid Diagnosis of Membranous Nephropathy Based on Kidney Tissue Raman Spectroscopy and Deep Learning

## 基于肾脏组织拉曼光谱和深度学习的膜性肾病快速诊断

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5223302/latest

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the most common causes of glomerular disease in clinical settings. Renal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing MN, but it is invasive and poses risks such as renal hemorrhage, perirenal hematoma, and infection. Furthermore, conventional light and electron microscopy techniques fail to distinguish between primary and secondary MN. The recent identification of autoantibodies against phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) and thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) antigens has provided key insights into the pathophysiology of MN. Although immunofluorescence assays for detecting serum anti-PLA2R antibodies and glomerular PLA2R antigens are used clinically to diagnose PLA2R-related MN, only 52%-86% of PLA2R-associated MN patients exhibit positive anti-PLA2R antibodies. Recent advances in Raman spectroscopy combined with deep learning methods offer promising non-invasive diagnostic approaches. Our previous studies demonstrated the high diagnostic efficacy of Raman spectroscopy for MN using human serum and urine samples, with excellent sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we present a rapid diagnostic method for MN based on Raman spectroscopy of mouse kidney tissue combined with a CNN-BiLSTM deep learning model. The model achieved 98% accuracy, with specificity and sensitivity of 98.3%, offering a novel supplementary tool for the pathological diagnosis of MN.

## 使用计算机和体内方法探测针对PDE4的暗化学物质以治疗牛皮癣

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5091663/latest

The potential downsides of standard treatments of Apremilast and Roflumilast include gastrointestinal side effects, the risk of mental episodes, and drug interactions, among other things. The rationale of the study is to pay attention to global efforts by describing currently underexplored chemical space regions. The objective was to investigate PDE4D inhibitors utilizing the dark chemical database. The goal was to address this by conducting a computational analysis that coupled docking with molecular dynamics, phase screening, and compound pharmacokinetics optimisation utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are key parts of drug discovery and development processes. We established the binding mode and critical residues (GLN-369, ILE-336, PHE-340, and PHE-372) involved in interactions with 1,39,353 dark chemical matter molecules out of which 15 hits were obtained and subjected to artificial intelligence (PK parameters) and MD simulations. RMSD and stable amino acids interact with four promising molecules 027230, 060628, 060576 and 085881. The ligand 085881 was found promising since it inhibits both IL-6 and TNF-alpha with IC50 of 18.41 &amp;micro;M and 34.43 &amp;micro;M respectively. In-vivo Erythema grading showed that 085881 test substances possess mild to moderate antipsoriatic action.

## 大胆的活化能: 初等教育中加速学习和内在动机的环境设计

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5592398/latest

This study introduces and validates the concept of "daring activation energy" - a distinct motivational-cognitive state that emerges under specific environmental conditions in primary education. Through a year-long experiment involving four experimental classes (N&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;93) with corresponding control groups, we demonstrate how systematic environmental redesign enables extraordinary learning engagement and accelerated cognitive development, with experimental groups showing significant IQ gains (∆=6 points, p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;.01) and remarkable learning acceleration. These outcomes were achieved through minimal intervention (10% of academic time), suggesting efficient transformation possibilities within existing educational systems. Our findings extend Self-Determination Theory by demonstrating how institutional structures can systematically support intrinsic motivation emergence, offering both theoretical framework and practical evidence for transforming educational practice.

# Personalized Prediction of Gait Freezing Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition

## 基于动态模式分解的步态冻结个性化预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5127334/latest

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common severe gait disorder in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The ability to predict the onset of FOG episodes early on allows for timely intervention, which is essential for improving the life quality of patients. Machine learning and deep learning, the current methods, face real-time diagnosis challenges due to comprehensive data processing requirements. Their ''black box'' nature makes interpreting features and classification boundaries difficult. In this manuscript, we explored a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based approach together with optimal delay embedding time to reconstruct and predict the time evolution of acceleration signals, and introduced a triple index based on DMD to predict and classify FOG. Our predictive analysis shows 86.45% accuracy in classification, and an early prediction rate of 81.97% of all samples with an average early prediction time of 6.13 seconds. This DMD-based approach has the potential for real-time patient specific FOG prediction.

# Combined machine learning models, docking analysis, molecular dynamics and experimental validation for the rapid design of novel FLT3 inhibitors against AML

## 结合机器学习模型、对接分析、分子动力学和实验验证快速设计新型FLT3抑制剂治疗AML

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5393379/latest

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant clonal disorder driven by the excessive proliferation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood, often linked to Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations, which occur in about one-third of AML patients. While FLT3 inhibitors such as Midostaurin, Quizartinib, and Gilteritinib have demonstrated clinical efficacy, their therapeutic potential is often limited by drug resistance and adverse reactions. Therefore, the development of novel FLT3 inhibitors is critical for improving AML treatment outcomes. In this study, we employed a multi-faceted computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach, integrating machine learning (ML), molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, to accelerate the discovery of new FLT3 inhibitors. A machine learning-based FLT3 classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.958, while an MV4-11 cell activity prediction model demonstrated strong predictive performance with an R2 of 0.846, MAE of 0.368, and RMSE of 0.492. Virtual screening of 7,280 compounds from the ChemDiv database led to the identification of 68 potential FLT3 inhibitors, with molecular dynamics simulations confirming their stable binding to the FLT3 protein. Experimental validation of four selected compounds showed promising activity in MV4-11 cellular assays, demonstrating the reliability of this integrated CADD approach. These results underscore the potential of a CADD-driven approach, enhanced by ML, to rapidly design new FLT3 inhibitors for AML treatment.

# Capabilities of a 3D Visualization Simulation for Teaching Interns in Clinical Education for Joint Replacement Surgeries

## 3D可视化模拟在关节置换手术临床教育中的教学能力

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5344850/latest

Aims This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of using 3D visualization simulation technology in teaching interns about joint replacement surgeries.Methods Seventy-six clinical medicine students who interned in the orthopedic department of our hospital from September 2023 to January 2024 were selected as the research subjects. They were randomly divided into two groups using a random number table method: 38 students formed the control group (utilizing traditional teaching methods), while the other 38 students made up the experimental group (employing a diversified teaching model combined with 3D visualization technology). The clinical teaching effectiveness of these two groups was compared, focusing on aspects such as classroom participation, interactivity, learning motivation, understanding of surgical procedures, satisfaction with teaching, confidence in independently developing surgical plans, theoretical examination scores, and practical on-site evaluation scores.Results The results indicated no statistically significant differences in demographics between the two groups of interns. However, significant difference was showed in classroom participation (7.58&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.15 vs. 8.47&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.86), interactivity (6.92&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.26 vs. 7.61&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.17), learning motivation (7.03&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.37 vs. 7.57&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.00), understanding of surgical procedures (6.03&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.26 vs. 7.63&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.10), satisfaction with teaching (7.42&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.20 vs. 8.13&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.02), confidence in independently developing surgical plans (5.68&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.42 vs. 7.26&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.16), theoretical examination (39.13&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;4.26 vs. 41.39&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;4.35) and practical on-site evaluation (32.68&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;3.85 vs. 38.18&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;4.93). The teaching evaluation of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group.Conclusion Integrating a diversified teaching model with 3D visualization technology in orthopedic education can improve teaching outcomes and student satisfaction.

# YOLO-STOD: An Industrial Conveyor Belt Tear Detection Model Based on Yolov5 Algorithm

## Yolo-stod: 基于Yolov5算法的工业输送带撕裂检测模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5155950/latest

Real-time detection of conveyor belt tearing is of great significance to ensure mining in the coal industry. The longitudinal tear damage problem of conveyor belts has the characteristics of multi-scale, abundant small targets, and complex interference sources. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of small-size tear damage detection algorithms under complex interference, we propose a visual detection method YOLO-STOD based on deep learning. Firstly, a multi-case conveyor belt tear datasets is developed for complex interference and small-size detection. Second, the detection method YOLO-STOD is designed, which utilizes the BotNet attention mechanism to extract multi-dimensional tearing features, enhancing the model's feature extraction ability for small targets and enables the model to converge quickly under the conditions of few samples. Secondly, Shape_IOU is utilized to calculate the training loss, and the shape regression loss of the bounding box itself is considered to enhance the robustness of the model. Finally, the detection performance of the designed algorithm in complex environments is verified. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high detection accuracy and detection rate compared with existing detection algorithms, and it is expected to be used for real-time detection of conveyor belt tearing in the industrial field.

# Training the Next Generation of Robotic Colorectal Surgeons in East London. A Systematic Review of Existing Robotic Colorectal Surgery Programs Worldwide

## 在东伦敦培训下一代机器人结直肠外科医生。对全球现有机器人结直肠手术计划的系统评价

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5089922/latest

Background: Robotic-assisted colorectal surgery (RACS) is gaining widespread adoption, with a growing number of procedures performed globally. These have been performed mostly by consultants, many of whom have gained sufficient proficiency to begin to educate their trainees. RACS offers a range of benefits to the surgeon and patient, yet safe and effective utilisation hinges on well-structured training programs for colorectal trainees within their general surgery residency. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the structure currently employed worldwide in RACS training programs for colorectal surgery trainees. In addition it delineates the conceptualization and implementation of a locally developed RACS program tailored to senior colorectal trainees and fellows at our Trust.
Methods: A comprehensive search of Ovid Medline and Embase databases (January 2010- March 2024) following PRISMA guidelines identified six studies reporting on RACS training curricula. Critical analysis of programme structure and curricula tools utilised was performed. Articles involving training of consultants were excluded. The quality and bias score of each study were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Score for observational studies.
Results: 6 out of 77 studies were selected as suitable for analysis describing RACS training using Da Vinci platform. All apart from one programme described a phased or parallel robotic curriculum with four studies incorporating theoretical knowledge and laboratory or cadaveric training. Six programmes incorporated simulation, bedside assisting and console training. The use of validated objective or subjective metrics at each phase varied. Formal feedback is provided in only two of the programmes. Reflecting on above results we present our Trust training program which run over the last two years.Our program ensures clear learning goals for trainees and trainers, maintains patient safety, and is easily replicated across other UK RACS units.
Conclusion: The establishment of a standardised curriculum for colorectal surgery training worldwide, including in the UK, is vital. Currently, there is a scarcity of validated, objective assessment methods, which must be adequately standardised to create consistent progression criteria and competency-based metrics. Standardising these methods will enable reliable and robust assessment of trainee progression and competence to create a generation of robotically competent colorectal surgeons within their standard training program timeframe.

## FinTechFake: 一种基于语言的人工智能方法，用于检测金融中的假新闻

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5520580/latest

The spread of misleading information on social media and internet forums has posed a serious danger to organizations and enterprises. This paper proposes an ensemble learning-based artificial intelligence approach called FinTechFake for financial fake news detection. Due to the public unavailability of the financial fake news dataset, we created a financial fake news dataset from the existing benchmark fake news dataset using topic modeling approaches. Substantial feature engineering has been investigated to extract the best-suited linguistic aspects that include sentence cohesion, stance, sentiment, and other grammatical features. Furthermore, linguistic features are combined with word embedding-based characteristics to apply an ensemble learning approach for the automatic detection of financial fake news from large text corpora. In terms of classification accuracy, both XGBoost and LGBM produce good results with 96.8% accuracy. When compared with the existing state-of-the-art, FinTechFake, outperformed others in terms of F1 score by 2.6%.

## 通过划痕分析和神经网络建模对生物和化学合成的金纳米颗粒进行伤口愈合

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5124354/latest

Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are commonly used as anti-haemorrhagic and antiseptic agents. Thus, their cytotoxicity should be studied before application. In this study, the Au NPs were synthesized using biological and chemical routes, and the samples were named as AU-BT and AU-C, respectively. The AU-BT were synthesized using three different extracts, i.e., turmeric, aloe-vera, and a mixture of turmeric aloe-vera. The cytotoxicity was studied using scratch assay on HEK-293 cell lines. The number of scratch assays was increased to validate the experimental wound healing results. Finally, a neural networking modeling was performed to predict the results of provided data in terms of the sample toxicity by healing the wound. The experimental results and the neural networking confirmed that the turmeric-derived Au NPs were the best among all the synthesized samples. Moreover, integrating metal NPs in wound healing studies introduces exciting possibilities for enhanced imaging and therapeutic interventions. The combination of advanced image analysis through models like AlexNet and the novel use of nanoparticles opens doors to improved wound care and a deeper understanding of the healing process.

# Dynamic Relevance Learning for Few-Shot Object Detection

## 基于动态关联学习的少镜头目标检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5203328/latest

Expensive bounding-box annotations have limited the development of object detection task. Thus, it is necessary to focus on more challenging task of few-shot object detection. It requires the detector to recognize objects of novel classes with only a few training samples. Nowadays, many existing popular methods adopting training way similar to meta-learning have achieved promising performance, such as Meta R-CNN series. However, support data is only used as the class attention to guide the detecting of query images each time. Their relevance to each other remains unexploited. Moreover, a lot of recent works treat the support data and query images as independent branch without considering the relationship between them. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic relevance learning model, which utilizes the relationship between all support images and Region of Interest (RoI) on the query images to construct a dynamic graph convolutional network (GCN). By adjusting the prediction distribution of the base detector using the output of this GCN, the proposed model serves as a hard auxiliary classification task, which guides the detector to improve the class representation implicitly. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO dataset. The proposed model achieves the best overall performance, which shows its effectiveness of learning more generalized features.

# ToxACoL: An Endpoint-Aware and Task-Focused Compound Representation Learning Paradigm for Acute Toxicity Assessment

## ToxACoL: 用于急性毒性评估的端点感知和以任务为重点的复合表示学习范式

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5513730/latest

Chemical safety assessment is critical in the early stages of drug discovery and ecological risk assessment. Multi-species acute toxicity assessment is typically conducted as the initial phase to determine whether chemicals can proceed to industrial use or clinical trials. Although deep learning has shown promise in acute toxicity evaluation, inherent challenges such as diverse experimental conditions, imbalanced endpoint data, and scarce target endpoint data are often overlooked. This hinders existing methods from revealing associations among multi-condition endpoints, and leads to poor predictive performance for data-scarce target endpoints, especially those related to humans. Here we propose a novel machine learning paradigm, Adjoint Correlation Learning, for multi-condition acute toxicity assessment (ToxACoL) to address these challenges. ToxACoL models biological associations among multi-species, multi-condition toxicity endpoints via graph topology and achieves knowledge transfer via graph convolution. An adjoint correlation mechanism encodes compounds and endpoints synchronously, enabling an endpoint-aware and task-focused representation learning for compounds. Comprehensive analyses demonstrate that ToxACoL successfully balances performance across multi-condition endpoints, yielding 43%-115% improvements for data-scarce human-related endpoints, while reducing required training data by approximately 70% to 80%. Furthermore, investigation into the visualization and interpretability of the top-level representation learned by ToxACoL elucidates the structural alert mechanisms behind acute toxicity and highlights the potential for extrapolating animal test results to humans when integrated with the filled-in toxicity values.

# EchoApex: A General-Purpose Vision Foundation Model for Echocardiography

## EchoApex: 超声心动图的通用视觉基础模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5332987/latest

Quantitative evaluation of echocardiography is essential for precise assessment of cardiac condition and guiding treatment decisions. The diverse nature of echo images, including variations in probe types, manufacturers, and pathologies, poses challenges for developing artificial intelligent models that can generalize across different clinical practice. Here, we introduce EchoApex, a general-purpose vision foundation model designed for comprehensive echocardiography analysis. Pretrained on over 20 million images from 11 clinical centers, EchoApex utilizes self-supervised learning and task-specific decoders for diverse applications in echocardiography. It performs sequence view classification, interactive structure segmentation, left ventricle measurement, and ejection fraction estimation. In benchmark evaluations, EchoApex outperforms task-specific models, achieving a mean BACC of 0.976 in classification of 18 common views, DICE of 0.93 in chamber segmentation, MAE of 3.9mm in left ventricle linear measurement and a zero-shot performance improvement over specialist models in all evaluated datasets. For ejection fraction estimation, EchoApex achieves an MAE of 5.6% and an AUC of 0.927 for cardiomyopathy detection. Despite using less than 4% of trainable parameters with frozen encoders, EchoApex with adapter demonstrates strong performance with minimal degradation compared to fully finetuned models. This work establishes EchoApex as a scalable, general-purpose model for echocardiography, enabling efficient adaptation across various clinical tasks.

# Noise-Aware Training of Neuromorphic Dynamic Device Networks

## 神经形态动态设备网络的噪声感知训练

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5033914/latest

Physical computing has the potential to enable widespread embodied intelligence by leveraging the intrinsic dynamics of complex systems for efficient sensing, processing, and interaction. While individual devices provide basic data processing capabilities, networks of interconnected devices can perform more complex and varied tasks. However, designing networks to perform dynamic tasks is challenging without physical models and accurate quantification of device noise. We propose a novel, noise-aware methodology for training device networks using Neural Stochastic Differential equations
(Neural-SDEs) as differentiable digital twins, accurately capturing the dynamics and associated stochasticity of devices with intrinsic memory. Our approach employs backpropagation through time and cascade learning, allowing networks to effectively exploit the temporal properties of physical devices. We validate our method on diverse networks of spintronic devices across temporal classification and regression benchmarks. By decoupling the training of individual device models from network training, our method reduces the required training data and provides a robust framework for programming dynamical devices without relying on analytical descriptions of their dynamics.

# Facial Expression-Driven Rehabilitation Robotics: A Machine Learning Approach with Stretchable Sensors

## 面部表情驱动的康复机器人: 一种具有可拉伸传感器的机器学习方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5599748/latest

Wearable sensor technology has shown significant promise in advancing personalized healthcare and rehabilitation. This study presents the implementation of stretchable sensors for facial expression recognition (FER) to control an upper limb rehabilitation robot. Traditional rehabilitation approaches, which rely heavily on therapist-administered exercises, face limitations such as variability in patient engagement and environmental constraints. To address these issues, we developed a low-cost, flexible sensor system capable of detecting subtle facial muscle deformations and translating them into control commands via a Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Our system classifies four emotional states &mdash; Neutral, Happy, Sad, and Disgust &mdash; with a classification accuracy of 92.4\%. Real-time performance tests on five subjects controlling an elbow rehabilitation robot demonstrated an average accuracy of 75\% for FER. Motor speed adjustments, driven by recognized expressions, dynamically adapt to patient comfort levels, thereby personalizing the rehabilitation process. The stretchable sensor system offers advantages over traditional methods like EMG and computer vision, including greater reliability, low computational demands, and reduced susceptibility to noise.This study highlights the potential of emotion-driven adaptive rehabilitation robots in improving patient outcomes and engagement. Future work will explore refining sensor placement, enhancing machine learning models, and extending the system to other rehabilitation contexts. Integrating such intelligent wearable systems marks a significant step toward more accessible and empathetic tele-rehabilitation solutions.

# Investigation of Hardware Testing Utilizing Standard 4-D Convolution and Optimized Deep Convolution Formulas

## 利用标准4-D卷积和优化的深度卷积公式进行硬件测试的研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5596533/latest

The purpose of this study is to discuss the application and performance of the standard four-dimensional convolution calculation and optimization deep convolution formula in hardware testing. With the wide application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [1] in image processing, video processing and other fields, how to efficiently complete these computing tasks on resource-limited hardware platforms has become a key problem. Although standard four-dimensional convolution is widely used, its computational complexity and resource consumption limit its application in large-scale convolutional networks. For this reason, deep convolutional optimization techniques are proposed to reduce the computation and memory footprint. However, as CNN goes deeper, parameters required by convolution increase sharply, which makes the on-chip memory solution inefficient [2]. In this study, field programmable gate array (FPGA) was used as a test platform to evaluate the resource consumption difference between standard convolution and deep convolution by comparing their parameters, computing time and power consumption under different hardware conditions. Test results show that deep convolution reduces memory footprint by about 90%, computation time by about 70%, and power consumption by about 50%. Studies have shown that deep convolution performs well on resource-constrained hardware platforms, especially for low-power devices such as mobile terminals and edge computing devices. In summary, deep convolutions provide an efficient and low-power solution for modern convolutional neural network hardware implementations.Key Words: Standard Four-Dimensional Convolution, Deep Convolution, hardware testing, optimization, CNNS.
