# Latent space dynamics learning for stiff collisional-radiative models

## 刚性碰撞辐射模型的潜在空间动力学学习

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad9ce7

**Authors:** Xuping Xie, Qi Tang and Xianzhu Tang

In this work, we propose a data-driven method to discover the latent space and learn the corresponding latent dynamics for a collisional-radiative (CR) model in radiative plasma simulations. The CR model, consisting of high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations, must be solved at each grid point in the configuration space, leading to significant computational costs in plasma simulations. Our method employs a physics-assisted autoencoder to extract a low-dimensional latent representation of the original CR system. A flow map neural network is then used to learn the latent dynamics. Once trained, the reduced surrogate model predicts the entire latent dynamics given only the initial condition by iteratively applying the flow map. The radiative power loss (RPL) is then reconstructed using a decoder. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture can accurately predict both the full-order CR dynamics and the RPL rate.

# Artificial Neural Network based Modelling for Variational Effect on Double Metal Double Gate Negative Capacitance FET

## 基于人工神经网络的双金属双栅负电容场效应晶体管变分效应建模

arXiv:2412.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have implemented an accurate machine-learning approach for predicting various key analog and RF parameters of Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistors (NCFETs). Visual TCAD simulator and the Python high-level language were employed for the entire simulation process. However, the computational cost was found to be excessively high. The machine learning approach represents a novel method for predicting the effects of different sources on NCFETs while also reducing computational costs. The algorithm of an artificial neural network can effectively predict multi-input to single-output relationships and enhance existing techniques. The analog parameters of Double Metal Double Gate Negative Capacitance FETs (D2GNCFETs) are demonstrated across various temperatures ($T$), oxide thicknesses ($T_{ox}$), substrate thicknesses ($T_{sub}$), and ferroelectric thicknesses ($T_{Fe}$). Notably, at $T=300K$, the switching ratio is higher and the leakage current is $84$ times lower compared to $T=500K$. Similarly, at ferroelectric thicknesses $T_{Fe}=4nm$, the switching ratio improves by $5.4$ times compared to $T_{Fe}=8nm$. Furthermore, at substrate thicknesses $T_{sub}=3nm$, switching ratio increases by $81\%$ from $T_{sub}=7nm$. For oxide thicknesses at $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, the ratio increases by $41\%$ compared to $T_{ox}=0.4nm$. The analysis reveals that $T_{Fe}=4nm$, $T=300K$, $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, and $T_{sub}=3nm$ represent the optimal settings for D2GNCFETs, resulting in significantly improved performance. These findings can inform various applications in nanoelectronic devices and integrated circuit (IC) design.

Abstract: Inspired by the principle of equal probability proposed by Boltzmann in the 1870s, we establish a theoretical framework for the most probable distribution of meta-structures in materials. Furthermore, we validate the reliability of this theoretical framework based on statistical results of these meta-structures within randomly generated binary alloys. Finally, combining this theoretical framework, the high-throughput first-principles computations and machine learning, we determine the atomic chemical potentials in the binary FeCr alloy, thereby providing a demonstrative application. This theoretical framework will open a new research area and lay a foundation for the atomic-scale design of targeted properties.

**Authors:** Wanda Hou, Molan Li, Yi-Zhuang You

arXiv:2412.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a data-driven, deep-learning-based Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) algorithm to automate the discovery of continuous Lie group symmetries in classical mechanical systems from their time-evolution trajectory data. MLSD uses neural networks (NNs) to predict conserved physical quantities that implement symmetry transformations of the phase space coordinates. After training, MLSD is able to identify the Lie algebra, particularly non-abelian ones, as indicated by the Lie algebra structure coefficients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLSD method, we applied it to simulated data from the classical three-dimensional Kepler problem and the harmonic oscillator. The results show that the algorithm successfully identified the hidden symmetry groups of both systems.

arXiv:2412.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.

arXiv:2412.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate high-pressure hydrogen in its liquid phase close to molecular dissociation using a machine-learned interatomic potential. The model is trained with density functional theory (DFT) forces and energies, with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional. We show that an accurate NequIP model, an E(3)-equivariant neural network potential, accurately reproduces the phase transition present in PBE. Moreover, the computational efficiency of this model allows for substantially longer molecular dynamics trajectories, enabling us to perform a finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis to distinguish between a crossover and a true first-order phase transition. We locate the critical point of this transition, the liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT), at 1200-1300 K and 155-160 GPa, a temperature lower than most previous estimates and close to the melting transition.

arXiv:2412.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite. Our work marks a step toward streamlining ML-driven NMR predictions for both static and dynamic behavior of complex materials, and toward bridging the gap between first-principles modeling and real-world experimental data.

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.

Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.

Abstract: Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.

# Latent Ewald summation for machine learning of long-range interactions

arXiv:2408.15165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.

Abstract: One of the goals of personalized medicine is to tailor diagnostics to individual patients. Diagnostics are performed in practice by measuring quantities, called biomarkers, that indicate the existence and progress of a disease. In common cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, biomarkers that are closely related to the clinical representation of a patient can be predicted using computational models. Personalizing computational models translates to considering patient-specific flow conditions, for example, the compliance of blood vessels that cannot be a priori known and quantities such as the patient geometry that can be measured using imaging. Therefore, a patient is identified by a set of measurable and nonmeasurable parameters needed to well-define a computational model; else, the computational model is not personalized, meaning it is prone to large prediction errors. Therefore, to personalize a computational model, sufficient information needs to be extracted from the data. The current methods by which this is done are either inefficient, due to relying on slow-converging optimization methods, or hard to interpret, due to using `black box` deep-learning algorithms. We propose a personalized diagnostic procedure based on a differentiable 0D-1D Navier-Stokes reduced order model solver and fast parameter inference methods that take advantage of gradients through the solver. By providing a faster method for performing parameter inference and sensitivity analysis through differentiability while maintaining the interpretability of well-understood mathematical models and numerical methods, the best of both worlds is combined. The performance of the proposed solver is validated against a well-established process on different geometries, and different parameter inference processes are successfully performed.

Abstract: In the realm of lithography, Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is a crucial resolution enhancement technique that optimizes the transmission function of photomasks on a pixel-based to effectively counter Optical Proximity Effects (OPE). However, conventional pixel-based OPC methods often generate patterns that pose manufacturing challenges, thereby leading to the increased cost in practical scenarios. This paper presents a novel inverse lithographic approach to OPC, employing a model-driven, block stacking deep learning framework that expedites the generation of masks conducive to manufacturing. This method is founded on vector lithography modelling and streamlines the training process by eliminating the requirement for extensive labeled datasets. Furthermore, diversity of mask patterns is enhanced by employing a wave function collapse algorithm, which facilitates the random generation of a multitude of target patterns, therefore significantly expanding the range of mask paradigm. Numerical experiments have substantiated the efficacy of the proposed end-to-end approach, highlighting its superior capability to manage mask complexity within the context of advanced OPC lithography. This advancement is anticipated to enhance the feasibility and economic viability of OPC technology within actual manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying rainfall extremes, making high-resolution precipitation projections crucial for society to better prepare for impacts such as flooding. However, current Global Climate Models (GCMs) operate at spatial resolutions too coarse for localized analyses. To address this limitation, deep learning-based statistical downscaling methods offer promising solutions, providing high-resolution precipitation projections with a moderate computational cost. In this work, we introduce a bias-informed conditional diffusion model for statistical downscaling of precipitation. Specifically, our model leverages a conditional diffusion approach to learn distribution priors from large-scale, high-resolution precipitation datasets. The long-tail distribution of precipitation poses a unique challenge for training diffusion models; to address this, we apply gamma correction during preprocessing. Additionally, to correct biases in the downscaled results, we employ a guided-sampling strategy to enhance bias correction. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves highly accurate results in an 8 times downscaling setting, outperforming previous deterministic methods. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/RoseLV/research_super-resolution

Abstract: The synthesis of heavy elements in supernovae is affected by low-energy (n,p) and (p,n) reactions on unstable nuclei, yet experimental data on such reaction rates are scarce. The SECAR (SEparator for CApture Reactions) recoil separator at FRIB (Facility for Rare Isotope Beams) was originally designed to measure astrophysical reactions that change the mass of a nucleus significantly. We used a novel approach that integrates machine learning with ion-optical simulations to find an ion-optical solution for the separator that enables the measurement of (p,n) reactions, despite the reaction leaving the mass of the nucleus nearly unchanged. A new measurement of the $^{58}$Fe(p,n)$^{58}$Co reaction in inverse kinematics with a 3.66$\pm$0.12 MeV/nucleon $^{58}$Fe beam (corresponding to 3.69$\pm$0.12 MeV proton energy in normal kinematics) yielded a cross-section of 20.3$\pm$6.3 mb and served as a benchmark for the new technique demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving the required performance criteria. This novel approach marks a significant advancement in experimental nuclear astrophysics, as it paves the way for studying astrophysically important (p,n) reactions on unstable nuclei produced at FRIB.

Abstract: In general, the comprehension of any type of complex system depends on the resolution used to look at the phenomena occurring within it. But identifying a priori, for example, the best time frequencies/scales to study a certain system over-time, or the spatial distances at which looking for correlations, symmetries, and fluctuations, is most often non-trivial. Here we describe an unsupervised approach that, starting solely from the data of a system, allows learning the characteristic length-scales of the key events/processes dominating it and the optimal spatiotemporal resolutions to characterize them. We test this approach on time-series data obtained from simulation or experimental trajectories of various example many-body complex systems ranging from the atomic- to the macroscopic-scale and having diverse internal dynamic complexities. Our method automatically performs the analysis of the system's data, analyzing correlations at all relevant inter-particle distances and at all possible inter-frame intervals in which their time-series can be subdivided: namely, at all space-and-time resolutions. The optimal spatiotemporal resolution for studying a certain system thus steps-out as that maximizing information extraction-and-classification from the system's data, which we prove being related to the characteristic spatiotemporal length-scales of the local/collective physical events dominating it. This approach is broadly applicable and can be used to optimize the study of different types of data (static distributions, time-series, or signals). The concept of 'optimal resolution' has general character and provides a robust basis to characterize any type of system based on its data, as well as to guide data analysis in general.

# Latent Ewald summation for machine learning of long-range interactions

## 用于远程交互的机器学习的潜在Ewald求和

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15165

**Authors:** Bingqing Cheng

arXiv:2408.15165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.

# Quantum machine learning for multiclass classification beyond kernel methods

## 超越核方法的多分类量子机器学习

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02913

**Authors:** Chao Ding, Shi Wang, Yaonan Wang, Weibo Gao

arXiv:2411.02913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with immense potential. In recent years, Havl\'i\v{c}ek et al. [Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.

## AI驱动的阿尔茨海默病无毒DYRK1A抑制剂的从头设计和开发

**Authors:** Concha, Pérez

In humans, dual-specificity Tyrosine-Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A is an enzyme encoded by the DYRK1A gene involved in various diseases, including DYRK1A syndrome, cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is the most prevalent form of dementia, accounting for 60–80% of cases and remains an unmet medical challenge with no cure and just palliative treatments. Recent studies have identified DYRK1A as a promising therapeutic target in AD, given its involvement in multiple biological functions and its alterations correlated with AD progression. In this work, we leverage multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, including pre- dictive models and generative algorithms, to design non-toxic DYRK1A inhibitors. We construct a dual-target drug discovery framework integrating AI-driven meth- ods with classical techniques to identify novel compounds. An ensemble Quanti- tative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model is employed for predicting compound affinities, while Directed Message Passing Neural Networks (DMPNN) are used to assess toxicity. In a generative phase, a Hierarchical Graph Genera- tion model (HGG) facilitated the design of potential DYRK1A inhibitors. Promis- ing candidate molecules were refined through classical docking studies, leading to their synthesis and experimental validation. As a result, pyrazolyl-1H -pyrrolo[2,3- b]pyridine was identified as a potent DYRK1A inhibitor, leading to the synthesis of a new derivative series. Enzymatic assays demonstrated nanomolar-level inhibitory activity, while anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties were confirmed through ORAC assays and LPS-induced pro-inflammatory response evaluations in BV2 mi- croglial cells. Pharmacological testing revealed that the mentioned compound and its derivatives exhibit significant DYRK1A inhibition alongside robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

# Predicting the excited-state properties of crystalline organic semiconductors using GW+BSE and machine learning

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-c7csx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Noa, Marom

Excited-state properties of crystalline organic semiconductors are key to organic electronic device applications. Machine learning (ML) models capable of predicting these properties could significantly accelerate materials discovery. We use the sure-independence-screening-and-sparsifying-operator (SISSO) ML algorithm to generate models to predict the first singlet excitation energy, which corresponds to the optical gap, the first triplet excitation energy, the singlet-triplet gap, and the singlet exciton binding energy of organic molecular crystals. To train the models we use the “PAH101" dataset of many-body perturbation theory calculations within the GW approximation and Bethe- Salpeter equation (GW+BSE) for 101 crystals of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The best-performing SISSO models yield predictions within about 0.2 eV of the GW +BSE reference values. SISSO models are selected based on considerations of accuracy and computational cost to construct materials screening workflows for each property. The screening targets are chosen to demonstrate typical use cases relevant for organic electronic devices. We show that the workflows based on SISSO models can effectively screen out most of the materials that are not of interest and significantly reduce the number of candidates selected for further evaluation using computationally expensive excited-state theory.

**Authors:** Fang, Liu

Computational modeling of the excited states of molecular aggregates faces significant computational challenges and size heterogeneity. Current machine learning (ML) models, typically trained on specific-sized aggregates, struggle with scalability. We found that the exciton model Hamiltonian of large aggregates can be decomposed into dimer pairs, allowing an ML model trained on dimers to reconstruct Hamiltonians for aggregates of any size. We trained an ML model on perylene dimer exciton Hamiltonians using quantum chemistry descriptors to resolve phase correction issues. Our model accurately predicted excitation energies and oscillator strengths in perylene trimers and tetramers, and analyzed the size-dependent optical bandgap in aggregates with up to 50 monomers, revealing quantum dot-like confinement effects. Future work will explore transferability across different monomers to predict optical properties in heterogeneous assemblies.

**Authors:** Roman , Zubatyuk

Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are reshaping computational chemistry practices because of their ability to drastically exceed the accuracy-length/time scale tradeoff. Despite this attraction, the benefits of such efficiency are only impactful when an MLIP uniquely enables insight into a target system or is broadly transferable outside of the training dataset, where models achieving the latter are seldom reported. In this work, we present the 2nd generation of our atoms-in-molecules neural network potential (AIMNet2), which is applicable to species composed of up to 14 chemical elements in both neutral and charged states, making it a valuable method for modeling the majority of non-metallic compounds. Using an exhaustive dataset of 2 x 107 hybrid DFT level of theory quantum chemical calculations, AIMNet2 combines ML-parameterized short-range and physics-based long-range terms to attain generalizability that reaches from simple organics to diverse molecules with “exotic” element-organic bonding. We show that AIMNet2 outperforms semi-empirical GFN-xTB and is on par with reference density functional theory for interaction energy contributions, conformer search tasks, torsion rotation profiles, and molecular-to-macromolecular geometry optimization. Overall, the demonstrated chemical coverage and computational efficiency of AIMNet2 is a significant step toward providing access to MLIPs that avoid the crucial limitation of curating additional quantum chemical data and retraining with each new application.

**Authors:** Simon J, Coles

The discoverability and reusability of data is critical for machine learning to drive new discovery in the chemical sciences, and the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’ provide a measurable set of guidelines that can be used to ensure the accessibility of reusable data. We investigate the data practice of researchers publishing in specialist organic chemistry journals, by analysing the outputs of 240 randomly selected research papers from 12 top-ranked journals published in early 2023. We investigate compliance with recommended (but not compulsory) data policies, assess the accessibility and reusability of data, and if the existence of specific recommendations for publishing NMR data by some journals supports author compliance. We find that, although authors meet mandated requirements, there is very limited compliance with data sharing policies that are only recommended by journals. Overall, there is little evidence to suggest that authors’ publishing practice meets FAIR data guidance.

**Authors:** Tong , Zhu

The accurate computation of reaction energy and reaction barrier height is indispensable for the investigation of chemical reaction mechanisms and rates. In this research, we employ the Deep post-Hartree Fock (DeePHF) model in conjunction with the local density matrix derived from different base quantum chemistry methods (HF, PBE, M06-2X, B3LYP and $\omega$B97M-V). Through extensive training on high-precision small molecule reaction data, including reaction structures and high-precision NEB (Nudged Elastic Band) trajectories, our model showcases better performance across various reaction barrier height datasets compared to the common density functional theory(DFT). The precision of the model rivals that of the double hybrid functionals. Notably, DeePHF maintains high accuracy even when applied to small molecules, medium-sized molecules, and standard benchmark reactions, displaying its substantial advantage in exploring reaction potential energy profiles.

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5653269/latest

This work seeks to evaluate how ML and GAI could be integrated into the cloud computing model with an effort of optimizing the use of resources, minimizing energy consumption and providing value added services. Similar to other systems of its nature, which are large-scale distributed systems, cloud computing systems have several topics of concern including dynamic resource management, security issues, and the issues regarding with the user interface. To address these discrepancies, this work proposes a single D-PAL framework that uses the predictive ML model application and GAI for synthetic data generation. In the cloud environments of the framework, it employs workload prediction and scheduling for resource estimation through ML, and scheduling through Reinforcement Learning, and for data augmentation through GAN. From the experimental assessment one is able to observe implicit improvements in the performance of the cloud resources, energy consumption, and customised user services. In this regard, this paper advances theoretical and empirical understanding on personnel characteristics of AI on cloud systems and deploy new methods that improve cloud performance and maintain security and usability. Future work will be more focused on expanding of the proposed models to scale and integrating other AI techniques to increase the cloud control.

The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and smart technologies has escalated the risk of network intrusions, necessitating advanced Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to ensure robust cybersecurity. This study presents a machine learning-based IDS framework tailored for IoT networks, employing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), binning techniques, and GridSearchCV for comprehensive feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. The CICIDS2017 dataset, a benchmark dataset for intrusion detection, is utilized to train and validate the models. The proposed pipeline begins with data pre-processing, including attribute verification, duplicate removal, and label encoding, followed by a detailed feature selection process. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was utilized to identify and retain the most significant features, feature engineering incorporated domain knowledge to create new attributes and employed binning techniques to effectively manage continuous features and GridSearchCV was applied to identify the best parameter combinations. Multiple machines learning models, including LR, DT, RF, NB and SVM were analyzed and optimized through this comprehensive pipeline. Visualization techniques further enhanced understanding of feature importance and model behavior. The performance metrics reveal the effectiveness of the approach, with Random Forest achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.78%, closely followed by Decision Tree at 99.50%. This underscores the efficacy of the methodology in addressing network intrusion detection challenges within IoT ecosystems. The framework provides a robust, scalable solution for securing interconnected systems against evolving cyber threats.

Background The transition from pre-clinical to clinical teaching is often a time of heightened anxiety for students. With the shift to bi-modal teaching during the pandemic there was an opportunity to explore the use of 360-degree videos and virtual reality (VR) simulation teaching to enhance educational experience and smooth the transition from pre-clinical to clinical teaching.Methods Two groups of students were recruited all of whom were about to have their clinical introduction to the periodontology department. All students received current standard induction programme. One group in addition to standard teaching methods also received access to 360-degree video and VR headset prior to standard teaching. Focus groups were then conducted with the students. A topic guide was developed and piloted. Focus groups were conducted online, audio was recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed codes and themes were developed using thematic analysis as a framework for analysing the focus groups.Results This study demonstrates how 360-videos and VR technology may enhance dental education, provided it is implemented appropriately and at the correct time in training. Overall, students had a positive attitude towards using 360-videos and acknowledged its value in meeting a range of learning objectives, including infection control, IT training, and clinic orientation.

# Enhancing Atom Mapping with Multitask Learning and Symmetry-Aware Deep Graph Matching

## 通过多任务学习和对称感知的深度图匹配增强原子映射

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5664604/latest

Atom mapping involves identifying the correspondence between individual atoms in reactant molecules and their counterparts in product molecules. This process is crucial for gaining deeper insight into reaction mechanisms, such as defining reaction templates and determining which chemical bonds are formed or broken during a reaction. However, reliable atom mapping data are often limited or incomplete within chemical databases, rendering manual annotation impractical for large-scale datasets. To address this limitation, we propose the Symmetry-Aware Multitask Atom Mapping Network (SAMMNet), a model designed to automatically infer atom correspondences by incorporating an auxiliary self-supervised task during training. SAMMNet employs molecular graph representations and leverages graph neural networks to capture both general and task-specific features, enabling enhanced predictive performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that the multitask learning framework, coupled with symmetry-aware atom mapping, improves accuracy and robustness in atom mapping predictions. This makes our method a promising advancement for computational chemistry and related fields.

# NOTEARS-M: Causal Bayesian Network Structure Learning of Mixed Type Data and Its Application in Identifying Disease Risk Factors

## Notears-m: 混合型数据的因果贝叶斯网络结构学习及其在疾病危险因素识别中的应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5644505/latest

Background Identifying and understanding disease risk factors is crucial in epidemiology, particularly for chronic and noncommunicable diseases that often have complex interrelationships. Traditional statistical methods struggle to capture these complexities, necessitating more sophisticated analytical frameworks. Bayesian networks and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide powerful tools for exploring the complex relationships between variables. However, existing DAG structure learning algorithms still have limitations in handling mixed-type data (including continuous and discrete variables), which restricts their practical utility. Therefore, developing DAG structure learning methods that can effectively handle mixed data is highly important for obtaining an in-depth understanding of disease risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms.Methods This study proposes an extension of the NOTEARS algorithm, termed NOTEARS-M, which is designed for Bayesian network structure learning with mixed-type data. The algorithm integrates continuous and categorical variables through a tailored loss function, enhancing its applicability to real-world epidemiological datasets.Results Extensive simulations were conducted across eight distinct scenarios, specifically, variations in the number of nodes, changes in the proportion of categorical nodes, different sample sizes, levels of categorical nodes, variations in edge sparsity, adjustments to the weight scale, different graph types, and diverse noise distributions. These scenarios demonstrate that NOTEARS-M consistently outperforms existing methods such as MMHC, mDAG, and DAGBagM across key metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and structural Hamming distance (SHD). Furthermore, the robustness of NOTEARS-M is validated through its application to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, revealing critical causal relationships among risk factors for CHD and diabetes.Conclusions NOTEARS-M provides a powerful and scalable tool for uncovering causal relationships in complex disease networks, with significant implications for risk factor identification and public health research.

# Enhancing Security Operations Center Efficiency throughMulti-Model Integration of Large Language Models and SIEMSystems

## 通过大型语言模型和siemsystem的多模型集成提高安全运营中心的效率

The rising rates of cyberattacks necessitate advanced solutions within Security Operations Centers (SOCs). This research explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to enhance the triage processes of Tier 1 SOC analysts. We evaluate five LLMs&mdash;GPT-4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA 3, Mixtral 8x22B, and OpenHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B&mdash;on their ability to classify alerts as 'interesting' or 'not interesting'. Our proposed framework, consisting of an alert generation module, an LLM agent, and a reporting module, was tested using Wazuh SIEM integrated with CALDERA for adversary emulation. The results demonstrate that GPT-4 achieved the highest accuracy with a precision of 94\%, recall of 92\%, and an F1-score of 93\%, significantly outperforming the other models. The integration of LLMs accelerated preliminary triage by reducing the average processing time per alert by 40\% and decreased the cognitive load on analysts by automating up to 60\% repetitive tasks. However, challenges such as hallucinations&mdash;occurring in approximately 5\% of cases&mdash;integration complexities and privacy risks associated with handling sensitive data were observed. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid approach where LLMs act as co-pilots alongside analysts, incorporating strategies for model transparency, bias detection, and compliance with data privacy regulations. These findings offer practical insights for enhancing SOC efficiency and resilience against evolving cyber threats, emphasizing the importance of prompt optimization, continuous learning, and industry collaboration for large-scale alert training in future studies.

# Active Grade Estimator on Short Answer Assessment

## 简答评估中的主动成绩估计器

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5651820/latest

When introducing machine learning to automated grading systems, active learning is advantageous by helping teachers provide as little guidance as possible to offer proper automatic grading results in the end. However, given a high variety of Q/A nature, one has to pay attention to a diverse set ofpossible correct answers to offer suitable grading. Moreover, students who lack self-confidence in replying to exam questionsusually put long-winded or formless answers which jeopardizes the automatic gradingto reach its reliable performance. All aforementioned factors prohibit applying the conventional keyword-matching approaches to solve the problem. To deal with the difficulty, we propose a novel two-stage query strategy based on large language models (LLMs).In the first stage, we match a student's answer to a key answer from a prepared answer set. Afterward, the student's answer shall be summarized through LLMs to a well-structured answer. The proposed LLM-based approach is considered a prototype-based learning method. We also attempt to reduce the possibility of bias labeling by having multiple graders as oracles to join the proposed active learning framework. The proposed approach has been demonstrated on two publicly automated short answer grading datasets with different grading tasks. Overall, the proposed model exhibits outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods focusing on similar topics in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

# URFM: a general Ultrasound Representation Foundation Model for advancing ultrasound image diagnosis

## URFM: 用于推进超声图像诊断的通用超声表示基础模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5662163/latest

Ultrasound imaging is pivotal in clinical diagnostics, providing critical insights into a wide range of diseases and organs. However, advancing artificial intelligence (AI) in this field is hindered by challenges such as the reliance on large labeled datasets and the limited generalizability of task-specific models, largely due to ultrasound&rsquo;s low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To address these issues, we propose the Ultrasound Representation Foundation Model (URFM), designed to learn robust and generalizable representations from unlabeled ultrasound data.URFM is pre-trained on over 1 million ultrasound images from 15 major anatomical organs, utilizing representation-based masked image modeling (MIM) and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning techniques. Unlike traditional pixel-based MIM, URFM integrates high-level representations from BiomedCLIP, a medical vision-language model, to handle the low SNR inherent in ultrasound imaging. Extensive evaluations show URFM outperforms existing methods, excelling in generalization, label efficiency, and training speed, highlighting its potential to revolutionize diagnostic accuracy and clinical workflows.

# Identifying Threat Detection Resources on GitHub: Scalable Clustering Using Machine Learning Techniques

## 识别GitHub上的威胁检测资源: 使用机器学习技术的可扩展集群

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5664665/latest

Many businesses rely on open-source software modules to build their technology stacks. However, those who lack domain expertise may struggle to find the right software due to unfamiliar terminology and specific names. As a consequence, search engines and other platforms often cannot be utilized effectively to discover appropriate solutions. There is thus a need for a more applicable approach to assist non-domain experts in navigating the vastness of available repositories, enabling them to efficiently discover and select the right solution for their business needs. To overcome these gaps, we introduce an approach that supports finding unpopular yet important open-source software repositories on GitHub using advanced machine learning techniques. For this purpose, we propose novel strategies for information gathering and data pre-processing that resolve scalability issues of existing solutions and enable clustering of repositories even when topics, descriptions, or repository names are unclear or absent. For our evaluation, we gathered a dataset of 221,971 repositories using GitHub search and keywords related to incident detection. We show that our approach is able to separate threat detection repositories from others with an F1-score of 0.93.

In this paper, we present a novel hybrid method for accelerated sky region segmentation that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the Lattice Boltzmann Level-Set (LBLS) model. By leveraging DeepLabV3+, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), and SegNet, our approach guides the active contour and extracts regions of interest. We employ a local image fitting level-set function to characterize the region-based active contour model and utilize the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) to achieve rapid convergence. This deep LBLS segmentation method not only preserves precise details of the sky region but also demonstrates improved robustness and computational efficiency. Experimental results on the CamVid dataset show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a mean recall value improvement of up to 14.45%. Our method contributes to advancements in sky region segmentation, essential for applications such as object detection, augmented reality, and virtual reality.
