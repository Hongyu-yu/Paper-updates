# Grand canonical Monte Carlo and deep learning assisted enhanced sampling to characterize the distribution of Mg 2+  and influence of the Drude polarizable force field on the stability of folded states of the twister ribozyme

## Grand canonical Monte Carlo和深度学习辅助增强采样来表征Mg 2的分布以及Drude极化力场对扭曲核酶折叠状态稳定性的影响

Link: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/161/22/225102/3325324/Grand-canonical-Monte-Carlo-and-deep-learning

<span class="paragraphSection">Molecular dynamics simulations are crucial for understanding the structural and dynamical behavior of biomolecular systems, including the impact of their environment. However, there is a gap between the time scale of these simulations and that of real-world experiments. To address this problem, various enhanced simulation methods have been developed. In addition, there has been a significant advancement of the force fields used for simulations associated with the explicit treatment of electronic polarizability. In this study, we apply oscillating chemical potential grand canonical Monte Carlo and machine learning methods to determine reaction coordinates combined with metadynamics simulations to explore the role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> distribution and electronic polarizability in the context of the classical Drude oscillator polarizable force field on the stability of the twister ribozyme. The introduction of electronic polarizability along with the details of the distribution of Mg<sup>2+</sup> significantly stabilizes the simulations with respect to sampling the crystallographic conformation. The introduction of electronic polarizability leads to increased stability over that obtained with the additive CHARMM36 FF reported in a previous study, allowing for a distribution of a wider range of ions to stabilize twister. Specific interactions contributing to stabilization are identified, including both those observed in the crystal structures and additional experimentally unobserved interactions. Interactions of Mg<sup>2+</sup> with the bases are indicated to make important contributions to stabilization. Notably, the presence of specific interactions between the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and bases or the non-bridging phosphate oxygens (NBPOs) leads to enhanced dipole moments of all three moieties. Mg<sup>2+</sup>–NBPO interactions led to enhanced dipoles of the phosphates but, interestingly, not in all the participating ions. The present results further indicate the importance of electronic polarizability in stabilizing RNA in molecular simulations and the complicated nature of the relationship of Mg<sup>2+</sup>–RNA interactions with the polarization response of the bases and phosphates.</span>

# An efficient Wasserstein-distance approach for reconstructing jump-diffusion processes using parameterized neural networks

## 使用参数化神经网络重建跳跃扩散过程的有效Wasserstein距离方法

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad9379

**Authors:** Mingtao Xia, Xiangting Li, Qijing Shen and Tom Chou

We analyze the Wasserstein distance (W-distance) between two probability distributions associated with two multidimensional jump-diffusion processes. Specifically, we analyze a temporally decoupled squared W2-distance, which provides both upper and lower bounds associated with the discrepancies in the drift, diffusion, and jump amplitude functions between the two jump-diffusion processes. Then, we propose a temporally decoupled squared W2-distance method for efficiently reconstructing unknown jump-diffusion processes from data using parameterized neural networks. We further show its performance can be enhanced by utilizing prior information on the drift function of the jump-diffusion process. The effectiveness of our proposed reconstruction method is demonstrated across several examples and applications.

# Machine-learned closure of URANS for stably stratified turbulence: connecting physical timescales & data hyperparameters of deep time-series models

## 用于稳定分层湍流的uran的机器学习闭合: 连接深度时间序列模型的物理时间尺度和数据超参数

**Authors:** Muralikrishnan Gopalakrishnan Meena, Demetri Liousas, Andrew D Simin, Aditya Kashi, Wesley H Brewer, James J Riley and Stephen M de Bruyn Kops

Stably stratified turbulence (SST), a model that is representative of the turbulence found in the oceans and atmosphere, is strongly affected by fine balances between forces and becomes more anisotropic in time for decaying scenarios. Moreover, there is a limited understanding of the physical phenomena described by some of the terms in the Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) equations—used to numerically simulate approximate solutions for such turbulent flows. Rather than attempting to model each term in URANS separately, it is attractive to explore the capability of machine learning (ML) to model groups of terms, i.e. to directly model the force balances. We develop deep time-series ML for closure modeling of the URANS equations applied to SST. We consider decaying SST which are homogeneous and stably stratified by a uniform density gradient, enabling dimensionality reduction. We consider two time-series ML models: long short-term memory and neural ordinary differential equation. Both models perform accurately and are numerically stable in a posteriori (online) tests. Furthermore, we explore the data requirements of the time-series ML models by extracting physically relevant timescales of the complex system. We find that the ratio of the timescales of the minimum information required by the ML models to accurately capture the dynamics of the SST corresponds to the Reynolds number of the flow. The current framework provides the backbone to explore the capability of such models to capture the dynamics of high-dimensional complex dynamical system like SST flows6.

**Authors:** Can Polat, Mustafa Kurban and Hasan Kurban

Simulating complex and large materials is a challenging task that requires extensive domain knowledge and computational expertise. This study introduces Pure2DopeNet, an innovative multimodal neural network that tackles these challenges by integrating image and text data to accurately predict the physical properties of doped compounds, specifically Carbon (C)-doped TiO2 and Sulfur (S)-doped ZnO nanoparticles. The model achieves quantum mechanical level accuracy, comparable to density functional tight binding (DFTB), across various doping levels, demonstrating its capability to determine the properties from a single simulation of the pure compound. Pure2DopeNet outperforms traditional deep learning architectures such as ResNet, ViT, and CoAtNet, delivering superior accuracy, faster performance, and reduced dependence on domain expertise. This approach highlights the potential of multimodal machine learning to revolutionize materials science by making high-fidelity simulations more accessible and efficient, opening paving the way for material discovery and the exploration of novel properties.

# Rapid Access to Small Molecule Conformational Ensembles in Organic Solvents Enabled by Graph Neural Network Based Implicit Solvent Model

## 基于图神经网络的隐式溶剂模型快速获取有机溶剂中的小分子构象集合

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-1hb0b?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Gregory A., Landrum

Understanding and manipulating the conformational behavior of a molecule in different solvent environments is of great interest in the fields of drug discovery and organic synthesis. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with solvent molecules explicitly present are the gold standard to compute such conformational ensembles (within the accuracy of the underlying force field), complementing experimental findings and supporting their interpretation. However, conventional methods often face challenges related to computational cost (explicit solvent) or accuracy (implicit solvent). Here, we showcase how our graph neural network (GNN)-based implicit solvent (GNNIS) approach can be used to rapidly compute small molecule conformational ensembles in 39 common organic solvents with high accuracy compared to explicit-solvent simulations. We validate this approach using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, thus identifying the conformers contributing most to the experimental observable. The method allows the time required to accurately predict conformational ensembles to be reduced from days to minutes while achieving results within one kBT of the experimental values.

# Improving the reliability of, and confidence in, DFT functional benchmarking through active learning

## 通过主动学习提高DFT功能基准测试的可靠性和信心

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-98nc1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Thijs, Stuyver

Validating the performance of exchange-correlation functionals is vital to ensure the reliability of DFT calculations. Typically, these validations involve benchmarking datasets. Currently, such datasets are typically assembled in an unprincipled manner, suffering from uncontrolled chemical bias, and limiting the transferability of benchmarking results to broader chemical space. In this work, a data-efficient solution, based on active learning, is explored to address this issue. Focusing -- as a proof of principle -- on pericyclic reactions, we start from the BH9 benchmarking dataset, and design a chemical space around this initial dataset by combinatorially combining reaction templates and substituents. Next, a surrogate model is trained to predict the standard deviation of the activation energies computed across a selection of 20 distinct DFT functionals. With this model, the designed chemical space is explored, enabling the identification of challenging regions, for which representative reactions are subsequently acquired. Remarkably, it turns out that the function mapping molecular structure to DFT functional divergence is readily learnable; convergence is reached upon the acquisition of less than 100 reactions. With our final model, a more challenging -- and arguably more representative -- pericyclic benchmarking dataset is curated, and we demonstrate that the functional performance has changed significantly compared to the original BH9 subset.

# Optimal performance of simple low-cost optical physical unclonable functions resilient to machine learning attacks

## 可抵御机器学习攻击的简单低成本光学物理不可克隆功能的最佳性能

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5275184/latest

In this paper we reconsider the Physical Unclonable Functions based on the traditional approach of optical scattering on random optical media. These devices have the major advantage of utilization of simple and very low-cost technology and therefore the potential to be installed all over the network providing critical cybersecurity operations such authentication, real time cryptographic key generation and generation of trues random sequences. To comply with the requirements of the aforementioned operations, critical issues must be resolved. We propose and implement algorithms for the generation of an almost unlimited number of uncorrelated optical challenges. We show experimentally that the uncorrelated challenges result in optical speckle which after the proper numerical processing generates true random sequences, we determine the optimal illumination conditions in order to achieve the best possible performance in terms of robustness and unpredictability. Moreover, we study the resilience of the PUF against machine learning (ML) attacks. We conclude experimentally that under certain illuminating conditions and using the uncorrelated challenges, the network cannot predict the responses being trained with a very large number of challenge responses (24000 pairs).

# Women and Household carbon Emissions: An empirical study based on input-output method and Machine Learning in China (2005-2019)

## 女性与家庭碳排放 -- 基于投入产出法和机器学习的中国实证研究 (2005-2019)

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5449928/latest

The international community is increasingly recognizing the importance and urgency of gender issues in the field of climate change and paying particular attention to the important role of women in this field. This study calculates household carbon emissions (HCE) in China from 2005 to 2019 using the input-output method and explores the relationship between women and HCE from the perspective of statistics and machine learning based on the SHAP algorithm. The study found that in the consumption categories such as housing, transportation, and clothing, every 1% increase in the proportion of women reduced indirect carbon emissions by 0.441&amp;ndash;10.001%, but this inhibitory effect weakened with the increase in income. Stochastic forest nonlinear regression shows that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between women, R&amp;amp;D investment, energy structure, and HCE. In addition, a small number of single women showed a role in promoting high carbon emissions, while women with lower education had a more significant inhibiting effect on HCE. The study also analyzed regional differences between 2005 and 2019. This study enriches women's research in HCE and provides a novel research method, which has important reference value for promoting gender equality and climate change research.

# Machine Learning Models for Diagnosing Skeletal Class I and III in German Orthodontic Patients

## 用于诊断德国正畸患者骨骼I和III类的机器学习模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5254525/latest

Background: The precise and efficient diagnosis of an individual&rsquo;s skeletal class is necessary in orthodontics to ensure correct and stable treatment planning. However, due to several correlations between various anatomic structures, it is difficult to efficiently determine the valid skeletal class.
Objectives: The primary outcome of this prospective cross-sectional study was the development of machine learning models for classifying patients as skeletal class I and III. Machine learning regression models were also applied to examine the ability to predict the individualised ANB of Panagiotidis and Witt, using the Wits appraisal parameter. &amp;nbsp;Furthermore, the investigation intended to compare cephalometric variables between skeletal class I and III as well as between age and sex specific subgroups to analyze correlations between cephalometric parameters and to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most important variables contributing to skeletal class I and III variance.
Methods: This study was based on the pre-treatment lateral cephalograms of 509 German orthodontic patients, who were diagnosed as skeletal class I (n = 341) or III (n = 168) according to the individualised ANB of Panagiotidis and Witt. Following descriptive analyses of cephalometric parameters, correlation analyses, and PCA, various machine learning models (RF, CART, KNN, LDA, SVM) and input variables were compared in terms of accuracy, reliability, sensitivity, and specificity in classifying an individual as skeletal class, I or III.
Results: Within the same skeletal class, age influenced cephalometric parameters: in skeletal class I, adolescents presented a more horizontal pattern (PFH/AFH, Gonial angle, NL-ML) and prominent mandible (SNB, SN-Pg) than children. In skeletal class III, the degree of sagittal discrepancy between jaw bases was most prominent in adults (ANB: III_Age&amp;gt;21-III _14&amp;lt;Age&amp;lt;20 -1.78&deg;). Comparing skeletal class I and III, the latter had more prognathic mandibles (SNB) and compensated incisors&rsquo; inclination (proclination of the upper (+1/NA: 9.01 &deg;), retroinclination of the lower incisors (-1/ML: 8.99&deg;). Among others, a correlation was found between the sagittal (degree of prognathism, SNB) and vertical (inclination, ML-NSL) orientation of the mandible (skeletal class I: p &amp;lt; 0.001, &rho; = -0.742; skeletal class III: p &amp;lt; 0.001, &rho; = -.665). PCA revealed that the first four principal components explain 93% of the variance in skeletal class I/ III diagnosis and that these parameters had the most influence loading score on the first component- PFH/AFH ratio (0.35), SNB angle (0.35), SN-Pg (0.37), and ML-NSL (-0.35). Evaluating machine learning models, the general model, including all cephalometric parameters, age, and sex, resulted in perfect (1.00) accuracy and kappa scores compared to the gold standard Calculated_ANB with the model's RF and CART. In model 2 the amount of input variables was reduced (Wits, SNB only), but the accuracy (0.88), and kappa (0.73) were still good in the KNN model. Finally, The Wits-appraisal demonstrated a very good (R&sup2;=0.61) ability to predict the ANB angle in the machine-learning regression models. the linear regression equation is: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;.
Conclusion: The precise diagnosis of skeletal class I/ III can be simplified by applying the machine learning model KNN with the input variables Wits appraisal and SNB only. This stresses the importance of their correct identification. However, a larger population, considering all skeletal classes, is needed to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model and to improve its performance in terms of kappa and specificity. Finally, Wits appraisal along with gender and age, can predict ANB angle with machine-learning regression models with a perfect fit.

# Effects of geographical and soil factors on soil arsenic levels in a typical arsenic-contaminated paddy field area

## 地理和土壤因子对典型砷污染稻田土壤砷含量的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5444921/latest

Heavy metal pollution in agricultural land has emerged as a contemporary environmental issue of prominent concern. The concentration of heavy metals in soil is influenced not only by inherent soil properties but also by geographical factors. Moreover, the identification of its influencing factors is challenging because of the intricate interactive effects among them. Previous studies primarily focused on single-factor identification and spatial distribution characterization, neglecting the characteristics and spatial features of soil heavy metal concentration under the interactive effects of geographical factors and soil properties. This study assessed the influence of geographical factors, soil properties, and their interactive effects on the spatial distribution of soil arsenic (As), in a typical arsenic-contaminated paddy field area by employing machine learning, analysis of variance, and spatial analysis methods. The findings show that the primary factors influencing the distribution of soil As are elevation, roads, rivers, soil pH, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Moreover, the interactive effect between elevation and soil CEC had a significant effect on soil As, exhibiting non-linear and spatially homogeneous characteristics. The interactive effect between rivers and both soil pH and soil CEC exhibited non-linear and spatially heterogeneous effects on soil As. Additionally, the interactive effect between roads and soil pH affected soil As, with non-linear and spatially homogeneous characteristics. By identifying the main influencing factors of As in paddy soil, this study further explores the variation characteristics of soil As concentration under the interactive effects of geographical factors and soil properties. These insights can serve as a valuable reference for the precise prevention of As pollution in paddy field area.

# Predicting Photovoltaic-Thermal Panel Output in Urban Contexts Using Machine Learning Methods

## 使用机器学习方法预测城市环境中的光伏热面板输出

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5588685/latest

In recent years, the use of data-driven methods for predicting photovoltaic (PV) panel electricity generation has grown significantly, with most studies relying on databases of actual PV panel performance. This study introduces a comprehensive methodology for predicting the performance of photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) panels, specifically focusing on electricity generation, hot water production, and carbon reduction. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods, particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forest (RF), this research differentiates itself from prior studies by integrating predictive models for both electrical and thermal outputs. Additionally, the study examines the effect of different installation patterns on PVT panel output. A total of 1,575 different installation configurations were modeled across three urban districts in Tehran, and the results were used to train the two ML algorithms, which were then compared using Pearson correlation coefficient (R&sup2;), Root-mean-square deviation (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. The RF algorithm demonstrated superior performance, achieving an R&sup2; accuracy of 0.91 and shorter learning time. Finally, a framework is proposed based on the findings and simulation steps for predicting electricity generation, hot water production, and carbon reduction of PVT systems.

# Mosaic integration of spatial multi-omics with SpaMosaic

## 空间多组学与SpaMosaic的马赛克整合

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5507983/latest

With the advent of spatial multi-omics, we can mosaic integrate diverse datasets with partially overlapping modalities to construct consensus multi-modal spatial atlases of the source tissue. SpaMosaic is a spatial multi-omics mosaic integration tool that employs contrastive learning and graph neural networks to construct a modality-agnostic and batch-corrected latent space suited for analyses like spatial domain identification and imputing missing omes. Using simulated and experimentally acquired datasets, we benchmarked SpaMosaic against single-cell multi-omics mosaic integration methods. The experimental data encompassed RNA and protein abundance, chromatin accessibility or histone modifications, acquired from brain, embryo, tonsil, and lymph node tissues. SpaMosaic achieved superior performance over existing methods in identifying known spatial domains with enhanced resolution and clarity while reducing noise and batch effects. It also ranked top for modality alignment, enabling seamless diagonal integration without the need for image registration. After integration, SpaMosaic can also impute missing modalities. With a mosaic set of mouse brain data with RNA and different epigenomic modalities, we integrated and imputed the missing omics. There we found the imputed gene activity scores of activating and silencing histone marks show the correct correlation with RNA. Moreover, we uncovered more region-specific genes and pathways showing the correct transcriptome-epigenome correlations in the imputed histone modification than in the measured chromatin accessibility modalities. Lastly, SpaMosaic&rsquo;s imputation also allows the inference of relationships between different modalities without requiring co-profiling from the same section.

# Machine-learning based prediction of appendicitis for patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the emergency department.

## 基于机器学习的急诊科急性腹痛患者阑尾炎预测。

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5617324/latest

Background: Acute abdominal pain (AAP) constitutes 5-10% of all emergency department (ED) visits, with appendicitis being a prevalent AAP etiology often necessitating surgical intervention. The variability in AAP symptoms and causes, combined with the challenge of identifying appendicitis, complicate timely intervention. To estimate the risk of appendicitis, scoring systems such as the Alvarado score have been developed. However, diagnostic errors and delays remain common. Although various machine learning (ML) models have been proposed to enhance appendicitis detection, none have been seamlessly integrated into the ED workflows for AAP or are specifically designed to diagnose appendicitis as early as possible within the clinical decision-making process. To mimic daily clinical practice, this proof-of-concept study aims to develop ML models that support decision-making using comprehensive clinical data up to key decision points in the ED workflow to detect appendicitis in patients presenting with AAP.
Methods: Data from the Dutch triage system at the ED, vital signs, complete medical history and physical examination findings and routine laboratory test results were retrospectively extracted from 350 AAP patients presenting to the ED of a Dutch teaching hospital from 2016 to 2023. Two eXtreme Gradient Boosting ML models were developed to differentiate cases with appendicitis from other AAP causes: one model used all data up to and including physical examination, and the other was extended with routine laboratory test results. The performance of both models was evaluated on a validation set (n=68) and compared to the Alvarado scoring system as well as three ED physicians in a reader study.
Results: The ML models achieved AUROCs of 0.919 without laboratory test results and 0.923 with the addition of laboratory test results. The Alvarado scoring system attained an AUROC of 0.824. ED physicians achieved AUROCs of 0.894, 0.826, and 0.791 without laboratory test results, increasing to AUROCs of 0.923, 0.892, and 0.859 with laboratory test results.
Conclusions: Both ML models demonstrated comparable high accuracy in predicting appendicitis in patients with AAP, outperforming the Alvarado scoring system. The ML models matched or surpassed ED physician performance in detecting appendicitis, with the largest potential performance gain observed in absence of laboratory test results. Integration could assist ED physicians in early and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis.

# Boundary Complexity of (Sub-) Cortical Areas Predict Deep Brain Stimulation Outcomes in Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease

## (亚) 皮质区域的边界复杂性可预测帕金森氏病的深部脑刺激结果

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5537857/latest

While deep brain stimulation (DBS) remains an effective therapy for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), sources of variance in patient outcomes are still not fully understood, underscoring a need for better prognostic criteria. Here we leveraged routinely collected T1-weighted (T1-w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to derive patient-specific measures of brain structure and evaluate their usefulness in predicting changes in PD medications in response to DBS. Preoperative T1-w MRI data from 231 patients with PD were used to extract regional measures of fractal dimension (FD), sensitive to the structural complexities of cortical and subcortical areas. FD was validated as a biomarker of Parkinson's disease (PD) progression through comparison of patients with PD and healthy controls (HCs). This analysis revealed significant group differences in FD across nine brain regions which supports its utility as a marker of PD. We evaluated the impact of adding imaging features (FD) to a clinical model that included demographics and clinical parameters&mdash;age, sex, total number and location of DBS electrodes, and preoperative motor response to levodopa. This model aimed to explain variance and predict changes in medication following DBS. Regression analysis revealed that inclusion of the FD of distributed brain areas correlated with post-DBS reductions in medication burden, explaining an additional 13.6% of outcome variance (R2=0.388) compared to clinical features alone (R2=0.252). Hypergraph-based classification learning tasks achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.64 when predicting with clinical features alone, versus 0.76 when combining clinical and imaging features. These findings demonstrate that PD effects on brain morphology linked to disease progression influence DBS outcomes. The work also highlights FD as a potentially useful imaging biomarker to enhance DBS candidate selection criteria for optimized treatment planning.

# Effects of Feel Your Best Self Mini-Lessons During Morning Meeting on Kindergarten Class-Wide Behaviors

## 晨会期间感受最佳自我迷你课对幼儿园全班行为的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5448711/latest

Universal prevention efforts in schools have been advocated as a way to address substantial challenges in access to social, emotional, and behavioral supports, but schools often struggle to deliver these services effectively. Feel Your Best Self (FYBS) was developed as one solution by offering a flexible, easy-to-use way for elementary teachers to integrate learning simple emotion-coping strategies. Using an alternating treatment design, we investigate the effects of FYBS mini-lessons delivered during Morning Meeting on class-wide behavior compared to business-as-usual Morning Meeting in a kindergarten classroom. Systematic direct observation and Direct Behavior Ratings of class-wide behaviors were used as outcomes. Results suggest increased class-wide academic engagement and positive affect in the instructional period following FYBS mini-lessons, as well as decreased disruptive behavior. No differences were found in class-wide frustration tolerance or flexibility. FYBS mini-lessons were perceived as highly usable by the teacher. This study provides initial evidence that FYBS can be used to promote emotion skills and positive classroom behavior and can be integrated into existing classroom routines such as Morning Meetings.

# Impact of Zircon Reinforcement and Copper Chill on the Wear and Tensile Strength of Aluminum/Graphite Composites with Experimental and Neural Network Approach

## 通过实验和神经网络方法研究锆石增强和铜激冷对铝/石墨复合材料的磨损和拉伸强度的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5070179/latest

This article presents insights into the impact of load and reinforcement (Zircon) on the wear behavior of Aluminum/graphite composites. Zircon is included into LM13 along with 3 wt.% of graphite in the proportions of 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 wt.%. The composite is fabricated using the stir casting process, with copper chilling positioned at one end to facilitate unidirectional solidification of the molten composite. Tensile, hardness, and wear analyses are conducted on the chill end of the specimen. The wear rate is determined for the load parameters of 30N, 40N, 50N, 60N, and 70N while maintaining constant sliding speed and sliding distance using a pin-on-disc experimental setup. At 9 wt.% of Zircon, tensile strength, hardness, and wear resistance improve correspondingly, thereafter declining at 12 wt.% of Zircon. The morphology of several reinforced specimens is examined for microstructure using a field emission scanning electron microscope, revealing that 9 wt.% of zircon exhibits less wear deformation compared to other specimens. The acquired wear data are being evaluated for Artificial Neural Networks utilizing the Levenberg-Marquardt method, and the findings demonstrate a strong correlation with the obtained results.

Feature engineering is of critical importance in the field of Data Science. While any data scientist knows the importance of rigorously preparing data to obtain good performing models, only scarce literature formalizes its benefits. In this work, we present the method of Statistically Enhanced Learning (SEL), a formalization framework of existing feature engineering and extraction tasks in Machine Learning (ML). Contrary to existing approaches, predictors are not directly observed but obtained as statistical estimators. Our goal is to study SEL, aiming to establish a formalized framework and illustrate its improved performance by means of simulations as well as applications on practical use cases.

# Two-stage White Blood Cells Detection Combined with Semi-supervised Classification

## 结合半监督分类的两阶段白细胞检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5422460/latest

The classification and statistics of white blood cells (WBCs) are critical steps in the microscopic examination of blood smears. Traditional manual microscopy methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, while machine learning-based automated detection approaches require a substantial amount of labeled data for model training, leading to high costs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a two-stage semi-supervised deep learning method for WBC detection. In the first stage, a region proposal network (RPN) with ResNet50 as the backbone is employed for the localization and segmentation of white blood cell images. In the second stage, a semi-supervised learning framework is utilized to train the WBC classifier. The model is trained and tested using 1,510 labeled blood cell microscopy images with WBC localization boxes. The proposed semi-supervised model achieves a classification accuracy of 86%, which is 3.2% higher than that of the fully supervised model. Furthermore, this two-stage model is compared with two end-to-end models, FasterRCNN and RetinaNet. The results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage model achieves an accuracy of 83.7% and a recall of 85.1% in detection tasks, both exceeding those of the FasterRCNN and RetinaNet models. Compared to a one-stage WBC detection model, the two-stage detection method allows for more thorough training of the WBC classifier, thereby enhancing overall detection performance.

# Beyond the "Wow" factor: Using Generative AI for Increasing Generative Sense-Making

## 超越 “哇” 因素: 使用生成性AI来增加生成感

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5622133/latest

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative tool in education, offering scalable, individualized learning experiences. However, there is a notable lack of theoretically informed and methodologically rigorous research on how GenAI can effectively augment learning. This study addresses this gap by investigating the potential of a theoretically informed GenAI chatbot, ChatTutor, to facilitate generative sense-making, leveraging principles from generative learning theory. The study had two primary goals: first, to build on theory to propose how GenAI could be used to support generative sense-making; and second, to empirically test its impact on conceptual knowledge, self-efficacy, and trust immediately after the intervention, as well as on conceptual knowledge, enjoyment, and behavioral intentions in a follow-up test four weeks later. Conducted in an authentic university course, the pre-registered experiment with 175 students compared ChatTutor to a generic GenAI system (ChatGPT) and a teaching-as-usual condition. Results show that ChatTutor significantly enhanced trust, enjoyment, and behavioral intentions but not self-efficacy. While ChatTutor improved conceptual knowledge over ChatGPT immediately after the intervention, it did not outperform teaching-as-usual. Four weeks later, ChatTutor significantly outperformed teaching-as-usual but not ChatGPT in conceptual knowledge. The manuscript underscores the importance of integrating human-centered design and educational psychology theories into GenAI applications to optimize learning outcomes and proposes future research and practical implications.

# Counterfactual GAN for Debiased Text-to-image Synthesis

## 反事实GAN用于无偏文本到图像的合成

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5177265/latest

Text-to-image generation (T2I) is a complex task to produce images that accurately reflect the content and meaning of the provided textual descriptions. Essentially, not every word in the sentence has a corresponding visual appearance. For example, the non-visual words &ldquo;are&rdquo; and &ldquo;a&rdquo; do not have corresponding visual regions, whereas the visual words &ldquo;men" and &ldquo;basketball" are crucial to generating visual regions. Existing methods treat all words equally to produce images, without distinguishing between visual and non-visual words. Gradients from non-visual words can introduce harmful bias that diminishes the total effect of textual guidance in generating image content. This paper presents a new debiased text-to-image synthesis method with a counterfactual learning scheme. First, we build a causal graph for text-to-image synthesis, which stands in the cause-effect interpretation of visual and non-visual words. Second, we treat the non-visual words as confounders that introduce misleading associations during the image generation process. To mitigate the influence of non-visual words, we conceptualize the process as calculating the Natural Direct Effect on the generated visual features and use the Total Indirect Effect to produce the final image for debiased text-to-image generation. By using our method on several existing models, significant improvements can be achieved in two prevailing datasets.

# An Android malware detection based on reconstructed API with TextCNN

## 基于TextCNN重构API的Android恶意软件检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5428398/latest

Most of machine learning-based Android malware detection methods use the application programming interface (API) as features. However, &nbsp;the effectiveness of API-based methods are often compromised by API changes during the evolution of the Android system. At the same time, most of these methods only use system APIs, so they cannot detect malicious apps that realize malicious behavior through third-party APIs. To address this problem, we have proposed an API names reconstruction method &nbsp;and have developed a feature selection approach that leverages the weights of these reconstructed names. Following this, we constructed a TextCNN-based Android malware detection model. To validate the robustness of our method against API changes, we conducted a series of cross-validation experiments using samples from different years. Comparison test also has been conducted, demonstrating &nbsp;that our detection method archives superior performance.

## 优化物联网安全: 人工神经网络 (ANN) 算法通过物理层功能进行身份验证和授权的性能

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5451216/latest

Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been widely investigated to enhance the security of IoT networks. This research study aims to compare the performance of different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms for authentication and authorization (AA) in the Internet of Things (IoT). The analysis will specifically focus on utilizing physical layer (phy-layer) properties such as device temperature and device antenna orientation, as well as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Link Quality Indicator (LQI). The study encompasses an evaluation of ten artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. Several optimization algorithms were evaluated in this study, classical methods (BFGS Quasi-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt, Fletcher-Powell Conjugate Gradient, One Step Secant), specialized algorithms (Scaled Conjugate Gradient, Bayesian Regularization), and more recent developments (Conjugate Gradient with Powell/Beale Restarts, Variable Learning Rate Backpropagation, Polak-Ribi&eacute;re Conjugate Gradient). Each algorithm presents a unique approach to optimizing the training process of ANNs, aiming to improve convergence rates, minimize error, and enhance overall model performance. This analysis seeks to explain the comparative advantages and limitations of these algorithms, providing a comprehensive overview that aids in selecting the most appropriate method for specific ANN applications. The methods were evaluated for performance based on the convergence epochs, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Regression (R) values. The research findings indicate that BR and LM had superior performance, as evidenced by their lowest MSE and higher R-values. In addition, the BFG, CGF, and SCG algorithms also exhibited significant performance in terms of MSE and R-values. In contrast, GDX exhibited comparatively higher MSE and poorer correlation coefficient values (R-value) in comparison to other algorithms. This study offers useful insights into the efficacy of different ANN algorithms for AA based on the features of the Phy-Layer in IoT networks. The findings can be utilized to improve the security of IoT systems, hence contributing to progress in the realm of IoT network security.

# Multi-purpose enzyme-substrate interaction prediction with progressive conditional deep learning

## 基于渐进式条件深度学习的多用途酶-底物相互作用预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5516445/latest

Understanding and modeling enzyme-substrate interactions is crucial for designing enzymes with tailored functions, thereby advancing the field of enzyme engineering. The diversity of downstream tasks related to enzyme catalysis calls for a computational architecture that actively perceives enzyme-substrate interaction patterns to make unified predictions for multiple objectives. Here, we introduce MESI, a progressive conditional deep learning framework for multi-purpose enzyme-substrate interaction prediction. By decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage process, MESI incorporates two conditional networks that respectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial catalytic interactions, facilitating a gradual shift in the feature latent space from the general domain to the catalysis-aware domain. Across various downstream tasks, MESI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on top of a unified architecture. Furthermore, the proposed conditional networks implicitly capture the fundamental patterns of enzyme catalysis with negligible additional computational overhead, as evidenced by extensive ablation experiments. With the support of this conditional perception mechanism, MESI enables cost-effective and accurate identification of active sites without requiring any structural information, highlighting enzyme residues and substrate functional groups involved in diverse and critical catalytic interactions. Overall, MESI represents a unified prediction paradigm for downstream tasks related to enzyme catalysis, paving the way for deep-learning-based catalytic mechanism cracking and enzyme engineering with strong generalization and interpretability.

The rapid advancements in additive manufacturing (AM) across different scales and material classes have enabled the creationof architected materials with highly tailored properties. Beyond geometric flexibility, multi-material AM further expands designpossibilities by combining materials with distinct characteristics. While machine learning has recently shown great potentialfor the fast inverse design of lattice structures, its application has largely been limited to single-material systems. In thiswork, we propose a novel approach that incorporates material properties as edge features within the graph representation ofmulti-material truss lattices, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) to develop a fast and efficient inverse design framework.We validate this framework by designing lattices with tunable thermal expansion and stiffness properties, showcasing its abilityto explore a broad and flexible design space. We showcase the framework&rsquo;s inverse design capabilities for both single andmulti-objective optimization tasks and assess its limitations. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior capacity of GNNsin capturing structure-property relationships for multi-material systems. We anticipate that the continued advancement ofGNN-assisted inverse design will play a key role in unlocking the full potential of multi-material truss lattices.

# Link Prediction via Adversarial Knowledge Distillation and Feature Aggregation

## 基于对抗知识提炼和特征聚合的链路预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4894235/latest

Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown strong performance in link prediction tasks. However, it is susceptible to higher latency due to the trivial correlation of data in its neighborhood, which poses a challenge for its practical applica- tion. In contrast, although Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) performs poorly, it has a shorter inference time and is more flexible in practical applications. We uti- lize a distillation model to combine the powerful inference capabilities of GNN with the inference effciency of MLP. Distillation models usually use a predefined distance function to quantify the differences between teacher-student networks, but this cannot be well applied to various complex scenarios. In addition, the limited node information severely affects the learning ability of MLP. Therefore, to cope with these problems. Firstly, we propose an Adversarial Generative Dis- criminator (AGD), which trains the discriminators and generators against each other to adaptively detect and reduce the differences. Secondly, we also propose the Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) to help the MLP obtain suffcient fea- ture information before distillation starts. In the experiments, it is shown that our approach can achieve good results in link prediction tasks, outperforming the baseline model Linkless Prediction (LLP) and maintaining a good inference speed on eight datasets in two different settings&lowast; .

# Research on RFID indoor location algorithm based on WPA-BP

## 基于wpa-bp的RFID室内定位算法研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5329318/latest

The conventional RSSI-based RFID positioning algorithm is extensively employed for indoor positioning. To enhance the accuracy of position coordinates and minimize errors, this paper proposes an innovative RSSI-based RFID indoor positioning algorithm that integrates the Wolf pack algorithm (WPA) and BP neural network. A WPA-BP hybrid neural network algorithm is the integration of WPA to optimize the weight and threshold of the BP neural network. Training samples for the BP neural network are derived from RSSI signal strength and tag coordinates measured by the RFID reader, while the WPA algorithm optimizes the threshold and weight values of the neural network, resulting in a WPA-BP neural network model algorithm. Compared with experimental results of indoor localization based on BP algorithm and WPA-BP algorithm, the results using WPA-BP hybrid algorithm reduces errors in RFID indoor positioning, mitigates the impact of environmental factors, and enhances overall performance based on RSSI.

## 基于跳连多尺度CNN的锂电池剩余寿命预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5015371/latest

In order to better utilize the feature information obtained by all convolutional layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), this paper proposes a lithium-ion battery remaining life prediction model based on jump connected multi-scale CNN. The proposed model takes the health factor of the battery as input, and uses the multi-scale CNN model based on jump connection to extract the local feature information and global feature information of the health factor of lithium-ion battery at different scales. Then, all the local feature information and global feature information are fused through the information fusion module, and finally the predicted remaining useful life is output. The experimental results show that the proposed method can predict the remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries more accurately. Compared with the classical CNN method, Bi-LSTM method, EMD-LSTM method and VMD-GRU method, the root mean square error (ERMSE) of the proposed method is reduced by 75.7%, 78.3%, 83.8% and 77.8%, respectively. Mean absolute error (EMAE) decreased by 80.7%, 80.9%, 86.8%, 82.3%, and mean absolute percentage error (EMAPE) decreased by 81.0%, 82.2%, 87.0%, 83.1%, respectively. The model determination coefficient (R2) increased by 17.4%, 23.2%, 44.5% and 25.8%, respectively.

# Tsunami Height Estimation via Gaussian Process Regression Using Maximum Absolute Pressure Change and Time from Seafloor Sensors off the Kii Peninsula, Japan

## 通过高斯过程回归使用最大绝对压力变化和来自日本Kii半岛海底传感器的时间来估算海啸高度

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5441059/latest

The Dense Ocean-floor Network for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) was recently installed to monitor tsunamis in the Nankai Trough. In this study, an advanced tsunami prediction model using Gaussian process regression that is suitable for seafloor pressure observations is proposed. In traditional approaches, only the maximum absolute pressure change recorded by seafloor pressure sensors was used as an explanatory variable. The proposed method includes the time when the maximum absolute pressure change is recorded as an explanatory variable. Because tsunami data observed by ocean observatories are insufficient for constructing Gaussian regression relationships, numerical tsunami simulations are used for learning and validation. After a tsunami is detected by DONET, the tsunami height prediction accuracy along the coast is increased by considering the time of the maximum absolute pressure change at seafloor pressure sensors. The proposed model enables rapid and effective estimation of coastal tsunami heights.
