# Forecasting high-dimensional spatio-temporal systems from sparse measurements

## 从稀疏测量预测高维时空系统

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad9883

**Authors:** Jialin Song, Zezheng Song, Pu Ren, N Benjamin Erichson, Michael W Mahoney and Xiaoye S Li

This paper introduces a new neural network architecture designed to forecast high-dimensional spatio-temporal data using only sparse measurements. The architecture uses a two-stage end-to-end framework that combines neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) with vision transformers. Initially, our approach models the underlying dynamics of complex systems within a low-dimensional space; and then it reconstructs the corresponding high-dimensional spatial fields. Many traditional methods involve decoding high-dimensional spatial fields before modeling the dynamics, while some other methods use an encoder to transition from high-dimensional observations to a latent space for dynamic modeling. In contrast, our approach directly uses sparse measurements to model the dynamics, bypassing the need for an encoder. This direct approach simplifies the modeling process, reduces computational complexity, and enhances the efficiency and scalability of the method for large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through applications to various spatio-temporal systems, including fluid flows and global weather patterns. Although sparse measurements have limitations, our experiments reveal that they are sufficient to forecast system dynamics accurately over long time horizons. Our results also indicate that the performance of our proposed method remains robust across different sensor placement strategies, with further improvements as the number of sensors increases. This robustness underscores the flexibility of our architecture, particularly in real-world scenarios where sensor data is often sparse and unevenly distributed.

arXiv:2412.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the identification of grain-corresponding Laue reflections in energy dispersive Laue diffraction (EDLD) experiments by formulating it as a clustering problem solvable through unsupervised machine learning (ML). To achieve reliable and efficient identification of grains in a Laue pattern, we employ a combination of clustering algorithms, namely hierarchical clustering (HC) and K-means. These algorithms allow us to group together similar Laue reflections, revealing the underlying grain structure in the diffraction pattern. Additionally, we utilise the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring accurate results. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments using both simulated and experimental datasets obtained from nickel wires. The simulated datasets were generated to mimic the characteristics of real-world EDLD experiments, while the experimental datasets were obtained from actual measurements.

Abstract: Ion beam analysis (IBA) is a set of well-established analytical techniques that exploit interactions of swift ion beams (with kinetic energy typically in the order of hundreds of keV up to tens of MeV) with matter, in order to obtain elemental composition and depth profiles in the near-surface region of materials. Machine learning is one of the most important tools in the field of material science, where it can extract valuable insights, make data-driven decisions, and improve overall productivity, making it a vital tool in today's rapidly evolving science. In this paper, I summarize the current status of application of Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) on IBA and demonstrate what kind of benefits we may have by embracing this technology.

arXiv:2412.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic resolution STEM images often suffer from noise due to low electron doses and instrument imperfections, hence it is challenging to obtain critical structural details required for material analysis. To address the problem, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for denoising STEM images. Our method integrates spectral fidelity, total variation, and brightness/contrast consistency losses to ensure the preservation of fine structures, smooth regions, and physical signal intensities, maintaining the structural integrity of the denoised images. Our proposed method effectively balances noise reduction with the preservation of atomic resolution details and complements existing methods, seeking to enhance the utility of STEM images in material characterization and analysis.

arXiv:2412.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning can uncover physical concepts or physical equations when prior knowledge from another one is available. However, in many cases, these two aspects are coupled and cannot be discovered independently. We extend SciNet, which is a neural network architecture that simulates the human physical reasoning process for physics discovery, by proposing a model that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). This allows us to simultaneously discover physical concepts and governing equations from simulated experimental data across diverse physical systems. We apply the model to several key examples inspired by the history of physics, including Copernicus' heliocentric solar system, Newton's law of universal gravitation, the wave function together with the Schr\"odinger equation, and spin-1/2 along with the Pauli equation. The results demonstrate that the neural network successfully reconstructs the corresponding theories.

Abstract: Advances in robotic control and sensing have propelled the rise of automated scientific laboratories capable of high-throughput experiments. However, automated scientific laboratories are currently limited by human intuition in their ability to efficiently design and interpret experiments in high-dimensional spaces, throttling scientific discovery. We present AutoSciLab, a machine learning framework for driving autonomous scientific experiments, forming a surrogate researcher purposed for scientific discovery in high-dimensional spaces. AutoSciLab autonomously follows the scientific method in four steps: (i) generating high-dimensional experiments (x \in R^D) using a variational autoencoder (ii) selecting optimal experiments by forming hypotheses using active learning (iii) distilling the experimental results to discover relevant low-dimensional latent variables (z \in R^d, with d << D) with a 'directional autoencoder' and (iv) learning a human interpretable equation connecting the discovered latent variables with a quantity of interest (y = f(z)), using a neural network equation learner. We validate the generalizability of AutoSciLab by rediscovering a) the principles of projectile motion and b) the phase transitions within the spin-states of the Ising model (NP-hard problem). Applying our framework to an open-ended nanophotonics challenge, AutoSciLab uncovers a fundamentally novel method for directing incoherent light emission that surpasses the current state-of-the-art (Iyer et al. 2023b, 2020).

Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a versatile and expressive alternative to traditional variational ans\"atze for simulating physical systems. Energy-based frameworks, like Hopfield networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, leverage statistical physics to map quantum states onto an energy landscape, functioning as memory descriptors. Here, we show that such models can be efficiently trained using Monte Carlo techniques enhanced by quantum devices. Our algorithm scales linearly with circuit width and depth, requires constant measurements, avoids mid-circuit measurements, and is polynomial in storage, ensuring optimal efficiency. It applies to both phase and amplitude fields, significantly expanding the trial space compared to prior methods. Quantum-assisted sampling accelerates Markov Chain convergence and improves sample fidelity, offering advantages over classical approaches. We validate our method by accurately learning ground states of local spin models and non-local electronic structure Hamiltonians, even in distorted molecular geometries with strong multi-reference correlations. Benchmark comparisons show robust agreement with traditional methods. This work highlights the potential of combining machine learning protocols with near-term quantum devices for quantum state learning, with promising applications in theoretical chemistry and condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Brain-inspired learning in physical hardware has enormous potential to learn fast at minimal energy expenditure. One of the characteristics of biological learning systems is their ability to learn in the presence of various noise sources. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel noise-based learning approach for physical systems implementing multi-layer neural networks. Simulation results show that our approach allows for effective learning whose performance approaches that of the conventional effective yet energy-costly backpropagation algorithm. Using a spintronics hardware implementation, we demonstrate experimentally that learning can be achieved in a small network composed of physical stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions. These results provide a path towards efficient learning in general physical systems which embraces rather than mitigates the noise inherent in physical devices.

Abstract: The discovery of novel superconducting materials is a longstanding challenge in materials science, with a wealth of potential for applications in energy, transportation, and computing. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled expediting the search for new materials by efficiently utilizing vast materials databases. In this study, we developed an approach based on deep learning (DL) to predict new superconducting materials. We have synthesized a compound derived from our DL network and confirmed its superconducting properties in agreement with our prediction. Our approach is also compared to previous work based on random forests (RFs). In particular, RFs require knowledge of the chem-ical properties of the compound, while our neural net inputs depend solely on the chemical composition. With the help of hints from our network, we discover a new ternary compound $\textrm{Mo}_{20}\textrm{Re}_{6}\textrm{Si}_{4}$, which becomes superconducting below 5.4 K. We further discuss the existing limitations and challenges associated with using AI to predict and, along with potential future research directions.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are changing atomistic simulations in chemistry and materials science. Yet, building a single, universal MLIP -- capable of accurately modeling both molecular and crystalline systems -- remains challenging. A central obstacle lies in integrating the diverse datasets generated under different computational conditions. This difficulty creates an accessibility barrier, allowing only institutions with substantial computational resources -- those able to perform costly recalculations to standardize data -- to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of universal MLIPs. Here, we present Total Energy Alignment (TEA), an approach that enables the seamless integration of heterogeneous quantum chemical datasets almost without redundant calculations. Using TEA, we have trained MACE-Osaka24, the first open-source neural network potential model based on a unified dataset covering both molecular and crystalline systems, utilizing the MACE architecture developed by Batatia et al. This universal model shows strong performance across diverse chemical systems, exhibiting comparable or improved accuracy in predicting organic reaction barriers compared to specialized models, while effectively maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for inorganic systems. Our method democratizes the development of universal MLIPs, enabling researchers across academia and industry to contribute to and benefit from high-accuracy potential energy surface models, regardless of their computational resources. This advancement paves the way for accelerated discovery in chemistry and materials science through genuinely foundation models for chemistry.

arXiv:2403.07795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in the design and optimization of neural-network quantum states (NQSs) has made them an effective method to investigate ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. In contrast to the standard approach of training a separate NQS from scratch at every point of the phase diagram, we demonstrate that the optimization of a NQS at a highly expressive point of the phase diagram (i.e., close to a phase transition) yields features that can be reused to accurately describe a wide region across the transition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on different systems in one and two dimensions by initially pretraining a NQS at a given point of the phase diagram, followed by fine-tuning only the output layer for all other points. Notably, the computational cost of the fine-tuning step is very low compared to the pretraining stage. We argue that the reduced cost of this paradigm has significant potential to advance the exploration of strongly-correlated systems using NQS, mirroring the success of fine-tuning in machine learning and natural language processing.

Abstract: This paper presents the principal challenges and opportunities associated with computational biomechanics research. The underlying cognitive control involved in the process of human motion is inherently complex, dynamic, multidimensional, and highly non-linear. The dynamics produced by the internal and external forces and the body's ability to react to them is biomechanics. Complex and non-rigid bodies, needs a lot of computing power and systems to execute however, in the absence of adequate resources, one may rely on new technology, machine learning tools and model order reduction approaches. It is also believed that machine learning approaches can enable us to embrace this complexity, if we could use three arms of ML i.e. predictive modeling, classification, and dimensionality reduction. Biomechanics, since it deals with motion and mobility come with a huge set of data over time. Using computational (Computer Solvers), Numerical approaches (MOR) and technological advances (Wearable sensors), can let us develop computationally inexpensive frameworks for biomechanics focused studies dealing with a huge amount of data. A lot of misunderstanding arises because of extensive data, standardization of the tools to process this, database for the material property definitions, validation and verification of biomechanical models and analytical tools to model various phenomena using computational and modelling techniques. Study of biomechanics through computational simulations can improve the prevention and treatment of diseases, predict the injury to reduce the risk and hence can strengthen pivotal sectors like sports and lifestyle. This is why we choose to present all those challenges and problems associated with biomechanical simulation with complex geometries fail so as to help improve, analysis, performance and design for better lifestyle.

Abstract: Many supervised machine learning methods have revolutionised the empirical modelling of complex systems. These empirical models, however, are usually "black boxes" and provide only limited physical explanations about the underlying systems. Instead, so-called "knowledge discovery" methods can be used to explore the governing equations that describe observed phenomena. This paper focuses on how we can use such methods to explore underlying physics and also model a commonly observed yet not fully understood phenomenon - the breaking of ocean waves. In our work, we use symbolic regression to explore the equation that describes wave-breaking evolution from a dataset of in silico waves generated using expensive numerical methods. Our work discovers a new boundary equation that provides a reduced-order description of how the surface elevation (i.e., the water-air interface) evolves forward in time, including the instances when the wave breaks - a problem that has defied traditional approaches. Compared to the existing empirical models, the unique equation-based nature of our model allows further mathematical interpretation, which provides an opportunity to explore the fundamentals of breaking waves. Further expert-AI collaborative research reveals the physical meaning of each term of the discovered equation, which suggests a new characteristic of breaking waves in deep water - a decoupling between the water-air interface and the fluid velocities. This novel reduced-order model also hints at computationally efficient ways to simulate breaking waves for engineering applications.

We illustrate the model's application in monitoring traffic over a week, yielding statistical insights that could benefit future smart city developments. Our approach highlights the potential of combining fiber-optic sensors with visual information, focusing on practicality and scalability, protecting privacy, and minimizing infrastructure costs.

**Authors:** Jiamin Jiang, Jingrun Chen, Zhouwang Yang

arXiv:2412.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of multi-phase fluid dynamics in porous media is critical to a variety of geoscience applications. Data-driven surrogate models using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise but are constrained to regular Cartesian grids and struggle with unstructured meshes necessary for accurately modeling complex geological features in subsurface simulations.
  To tackle this difficulty, we build surrogate models based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate space-time solutions of multi-phase flow and transport processes. Particularly, a novel Graph U-Net framework, referred to as AMG-GU, is developed to enable hierarchical graph learning for the parabolic pressure component of the coupled partial differential equation (PDE) system. Drawing inspiration from aggregation-type Algebraic Multigrid (AMG), we propose a graph coarsening strategy adapted to heterogeneous PDE coefficients, achieving an effective graph pooling operation.
  Results of three-dimensional heterogeneous test cases demonstrate that the multi-level surrogates predict pressure and saturation dynamics with high accuracy, significantly outperforming the single-level baseline. Our Graph U-Net model exhibits great generalization capability to unseen model configurations.

Abstract: The transition to sustainable green hydrogen production demands innovative electrocatalyst design strategies that can overcome current technological limitations. This study introduces a comprehensive data-driven approach to predicting and understanding catalytic performance for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) using advanced machine learning methodologies. By usimg a dataset of 16,226 data points from the Catalysis-hub database, we developed a novel stacking ensemble model that integrates Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression to predict Gibbs free energy of adsorption across diverse bimetallic alloy surfaces. Our innovative feature engineering strategy combined Matminer-based compositional analysis, Principal Component Analysis for adsorption site related features, and correlation screening to generate robust predictive descriptors. The machine learning model demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities, achieving R^2 values of 0.98 for HER and 0.94 for OER, with Mean Absolute Error values of 0.251 and 0.121, respectively. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis revealed critical insights into the complex interplay of compositional, structural, and electronic features governing catalytic performance. The research provides a powerful computational framework for accelerating electrocatalyst design, offering unprecedented insights into the fundamental properties that drive hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. By bridging advanced machine learning techniques with fundamental electrochemical principles, this study presents a transformative approach to developing cost-effective, high-performance catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

We consider velocity increment, spatial transport and curvature statistics, and find excellent agreement with the baseline trajectories for fixed particle energies. Additionally, we consider two synthetic turbulence models for comparison. Finally, challenges towards an application-ready transport model based on our approach are discussed.

Abstract: Predicting thermodynamic properties of mixtures is a cornerstone of chemical engineering, yet conventional group-contribution (GC) methods like modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) remain limited by incomplete tables of pair-interaction parameters. To address this, we present modified UNIFAC 2.0, a hybrid model that integrates a matrix completion method from machine learning into the GC framework, allowing for the simultaneous training of all pair-interaction parameters, including the prediction of parameters that cannot be fitted due to missing data. Utilizing an extensive training set of more than 500,000 experimental data for activity coefficients and excess enthalpies from the Dortmund Data Bank, modified UNIFAC 2.0 achieves improved accuracy compared to the latest published version of modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) while significantly expanding the predictive scope. Its flexible design allows updates with new experimental data or customizations for specific applications. The new model can easily be implemented in established simulation software with complete parameter tables readily available.

A distinguishing feature of this approach is that once the adjoint problem is solved, its solution can be used to project the RE density forward in time for an arbitrary initial momentum space distribution of REs. Furthermore, by employing a PINN, a parametric solution to the adjoint problem can be learned. Thus, once trained, this adjoint-deep learning framework is able to efficiently project the RE density forward in time across various plasma conditions while still including a fully kinetic description of RE dynamics. As an example application, the temporal evolution of the density of primary electrons is studied, with particular emphasis on evaluating the decay of a RE population when below threshold. Predictions from the adjoint-deep learning framework are found to be in good agreement with a traditional relativistic electron Fokker-Planck solver, for several distinct initial conditions, and across an array of physics parameters. Once trained the PINN thus provides a means of generating RE density time histories with exceptionally low online execution time.

# An Efficient Surrogate Model of Secondary Electron Formation and Evolution

## 二次电子形成和演化的有效替代模型

Abstract: This work extends the adjoint-deep learning framework for runaway electron (RE) evolution developed in Ref. [C. McDevitt et al., A physics-constrained deep learning treatment of runaway electron dynamics, Submitted to Physics of Plasmas (2024)] to account for large-angle collisions. By incorporating large-angle collisions the framework allows the avalanche of REs to be captured, an essential component to RE dynamics. This extension is accomplished by using a Rosenbluth-Putvinski approximation to estimate the distribution of secondary electrons generated by large-angle collisions. By evolving both the primary and multiple generations of secondary electrons, the present formulation is able to capture both the detailed temporal evolution of a RE population beginning from an arbitrary initial momentum space distribution, along with providing approximations to the saturated growth and decay rates of the RE population. Predictions of the adjoint-deep learning framework are verified against a traditional RE solver, with good agreement present across a broad range of parameters.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are changing atomistic simulations in chemistry and materials science. Yet, building a single, universal MLIP -- capable of accurately modeling both molecular and crystalline systems -- remains challenging. A central obstacle lies in integrating the diverse datasets generated under different computational conditions. This difficulty creates an accessibility barrier, allowing only institutions with substantial computational resources -- those able to perform costly recalculations to standardize data -- to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of universal MLIPs. Here, we present Total Energy Alignment (TEA), an approach that enables the seamless integration of heterogeneous quantum chemical datasets almost without redundant calculations. Using TEA, we have trained MACE-Osaka24, the first open-source neural network potential model based on a unified dataset covering both molecular and crystalline systems, utilizing the MACE architecture developed by Batatia et al. This universal model shows strong performance across diverse chemical systems, exhibiting comparable or improved accuracy in predicting organic reaction barriers compared to specialized models, while effectively maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for inorganic systems. Our method democratizes the development of universal MLIPs, enabling researchers across academia and industry to contribute to and benefit from high-accuracy potential energy surface models, regardless of their computational resources. This advancement paves the way for accelerated discovery in chemistry and materials science through genuinely foundation models for chemistry.

**Authors:** Bao-Bing Li, Yi Gu, Shao-Feng Wu

arXiv:2412.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning can uncover physical concepts or physical equations when prior knowledge from another one is available. However, in many cases, these two aspects are coupled and cannot be discovered independently. We extend SciNet, which is a neural network architecture that simulates the human physical reasoning process for physics discovery, by proposing a model that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). This allows us to simultaneously discover physical concepts and governing equations from simulated experimental data across diverse physical systems. We apply the model to several key examples inspired by the history of physics, including Copernicus' heliocentric solar system, Newton's law of universal gravitation, the wave function together with the Schr\"odinger equation, and spin-1/2 along with the Pauli equation. The results demonstrate that the neural network successfully reconstructs the corresponding theories.

Abstract: We address the identification of grain-corresponding Laue reflections in energy dispersive Laue diffraction (EDLD) experiments by formulating it as a clustering problem solvable through unsupervised machine learning (ML). To achieve reliable and efficient identification of grains in a Laue pattern, we employ a combination of clustering algorithms, namely hierarchical clustering (HC) and K-means. These algorithms allow us to group together similar Laue reflections, revealing the underlying grain structure in the diffraction pattern. Additionally, we utilise the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring accurate results. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments using both simulated and experimental datasets obtained from nickel wires. The simulated datasets were generated to mimic the characteristics of real-world EDLD experiments, while the experimental datasets were obtained from actual measurements.

Abstract: Advances in robotic control and sensing have propelled the rise of automated scientific laboratories capable of high-throughput experiments. However, automated scientific laboratories are currently limited by human intuition in their ability to efficiently design and interpret experiments in high-dimensional spaces, throttling scientific discovery. We present AutoSciLab, a machine learning framework for driving autonomous scientific experiments, forming a surrogate researcher purposed for scientific discovery in high-dimensional spaces. AutoSciLab autonomously follows the scientific method in four steps: (i) generating high-dimensional experiments (x \in R^D) using a variational autoencoder (ii) selecting optimal experiments by forming hypotheses using active learning (iii) distilling the experimental results to discover relevant low-dimensional latent variables (z \in R^d, with d << D) with a 'directional autoencoder' and (iv) learning a human interpretable equation connecting the discovered latent variables with a quantity of interest (y = f(z)), using a neural network equation learner. We validate the generalizability of AutoSciLab by rediscovering a) the principles of projectile motion and b) the phase transitions within the spin-states of the Ising model (NP-hard problem). Applying our framework to an open-ended nanophotonics challenge, AutoSciLab uncovers a fundamentally novel method for directing incoherent light emission that surpasses the current state-of-the-art (Iyer et al. 2023b, 2020).

**Authors:** Manas Sajjan, Vinit Singh, Sabre Kais

arXiv:2412.12398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a versatile and expressive alternative to traditional variational ans\"atze for simulating physical systems. Energy-based frameworks, like Hopfield networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, leverage statistical physics to map quantum states onto an energy landscape, functioning as memory descriptors. Here, we show that such models can be efficiently trained using Monte Carlo techniques enhanced by quantum devices. Our algorithm scales linearly with circuit width and depth, requires constant measurements, avoids mid-circuit measurements, and is polynomial in storage, ensuring optimal efficiency. It applies to both phase and amplitude fields, significantly expanding the trial space compared to prior methods. Quantum-assisted sampling accelerates Markov Chain convergence and improves sample fidelity, offering advantages over classical approaches. We validate our method by accurately learning ground states of local spin models and non-local electronic structure Hamiltonians, even in distorted molecular geometries with strong multi-reference correlations. Benchmark comparisons show robust agreement with traditional methods. This work highlights the potential of combining machine learning protocols with near-term quantum devices for quantum state learning, with promising applications in theoretical chemistry and condensed matter physics.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of multi-mode optical systems driven by two-photon processes and subject to non-local losses, incorporating quantum noise at the Gaussian level. Our findings show that the statistics retrieved from a single Gaussian quantum trajectory exhibits emergent thermal equilibrium governed by an Ising Hamiltonian, encoded in the dissipative coupling between modes. The system's effective temperature is set by the driving strength relative to the oscillation threshold. Given the ultra-short time scales typical of all-optical devices, our study demonstrates that such multi-mode optical systems can operate as ultra-fast Boltzmann samplers, paving the way towards the realization of efficient hardware for combinatorial optimization, with promising applications in machine learning and beyond.

Abstract: Physics Playground is an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) application designed for educational purposes, featuring a virtual laboratory where users interact with various physics phenomena through guided experiments. This study aims to evaluate the application's design and educational content to facilitate its integration into classroom settings. A quantitative data collection investigated learning outcomes, related confidence, user experience, and perceived cognitive load, through a 2x2 within-between subjects setup, with participants divided into two conditions (VR vs. slideshow) and knowledge levels assessed twice (pre- and post-tests). A qualitative approach included interviews and a focus group to explore education experts' opinions on the overall experience and didactic content. Results showed an improvement in physics knowledge and confidence after the learning experience compared to baseline, regardless of the condition. Despite comparable perceived cognitive load, slideshow learning was slightly more effective in enhancing physics knowledge. However, both qualitative and quantitative results highlighted the immersive advantage of VR in enhancing user satisfaction. This approach pointed out limitations and advantages of VR-based learning, but more research is needed to understand how it can be implemented into broader teaching strategies.

# Theory of Unsupervised Super-Resolution Data Assimilation with Conditional Variational Autoencoders: Estimating Background Covariances via Super-Resolution

## 使用条件变分自动编码器进行无监督超分辨率数据同化的理论: 通过超分辨率估计背景协方差

**Authors:** Yuki Yasuda, Ryo Onishi

Abstract: This study proposes a theory of unsupervised super-resolution data assimilation (SRDA) using conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). The theory is based on an evidence lower bound that leads to an objective function for unsupervised learning. This function can be reduced to the objective function of a traditional data assimilation method, namely the three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) formalism. Similar to 3D-Var, it is essential to use a non-diagonal background error covariance matrix to assimilate distant observations. Instead of using such a non-diagonal matrix, we extend the proposed theory by using the non-locality of super-resolution (SR). For linear SR, SR operators serve as background error covariance matrices. For nonlinear SR, error backpropagation through SR neural networks induces covariance structures in inference. SRDA can be performed using CVAEs because the loss function for CVAEs is generally an evidence lower bound. By incorporating the SR neural network into the CVAE, the encoder estimates the high-resolution (HR) analysis from HR observations and low-resolution (LR) forecasts. The decoder acts as the observation operator and reconstructs the HR observations from the estimated HR analysis. The effectiveness of SRDA was evaluated through numerical experiments using an idealized barotropic ocean jet system. Compared to inference with an ensemble Kalman filter, SRDA demonstrated superior accuracy in HR inference. SRDA was also computationally efficient because it does not require HR numerical integration or ensemble calculations. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for integrating SR and DA, which will stimulate further research in this direction.

Abstract: Precise and reliable climate projections are required for climate adaptation and mitigation, but Earth system models still exhibit great uncertainties. Several approaches have been developed to reduce the spread of climate projections and feedbacks, yet those methods cannot capture the non-linear complexity inherent in the climate system. Using a Transfer Learning approach, we show that Machine Learning can be used to optimally leverage and merge the knowledge gained from Earth system models simulations and historical observations to reduce the spread of global surface air temperature fields projected in the 21st century. We reach an uncertainty reduction of more than 50% with respect to state-of-the-art approaches, while giving evidence that our novel method provides improved regional temperature patterns together with narrower projections uncertainty, urgently required for climate adaptation.

# SMILES All Around: Structure to SMILES conversion for Transition Metal Complexes

## 周围的微笑: 过渡金属配合物的结构到微笑的转换

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-c660p?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** David, Balcells

We present a method for creating RDKit parsable SMILES for transition metal complexes (TMCs) based on xyz-coordinates and overall charge of the complex. This can be viewed as an extension to the program xyz2mol that does the same for organic molecules. The only dependency is RDKit, which makes it widely applicable. One thing that has been lacking when it comes to generating SMILES from structure for TMCs is an existing SMILES dataset to compare with. Therefore, sanity-checking a method has required manual work. Therefore, we also generate SMILES two other ways; one where ligand charges and TMC connectivity are based on natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis from density functional theory (DFT) calculations utilizing recent work by Kneiding et al. (Digital Discovery 2023, 2, 618-633). Another one fixes SMILES available through the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), making them parsable by RDKit. We compare these three different ways of obtaining SMILES for a subset of the CSD (tmQMg) and find >70% agreement for all three pairs. We utilize these SMILES to make simple molecular fingerprint (FP) and graph-based representations of the molecules to be used in the context of machine learning. Comparing with the graphs made by Kneiding et al. where nodes and edges are featurized with DFT properties, we find that depending on the target property (polarizability, HOMO-LUMO gap or dipole moment) the SMILES based representations can perform equally well. This makes them very suitable as baseline-models. Finally we present a dataset of 227k RDKit parsable SMILES for mononuclear TMCs in the CSD.

**Authors:** Gang Seob, Jung

Machine learning-based interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have transformed the prediction of potential energy surfaces (PESs), achieving accuracy comparable to ab initio calculations. However, atomic energy predictions, often assumed to lack physical meaning, remain underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that inaccuracies in atomic energy predictions reduce the robustness and transferability of Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) and serve as a critical indicator of training data quality. By pre-training atomic energy predictions using empirical potentials and applying transfer learning with density functional theory (DFT) data, we achieve improvements in the accuracy of total energy, forces, and stress predictions. Furthermore, this approach enhances the robustness and transferability of NNPs, emphasizing the importance of atomic energy predictions in developing high-quality and reliable MLIPs.

# The surprising ineffectiveness of molecular dynamics coordinates for predicting bioactivity with machine learning

## 使用机器学习预测生物活性的分子动力学坐标的惊人无效性

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rp81v?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Francesca , Grisoni

Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity remains a major challenge in drug discovery, despite the rapid progress of machine learning. Interestingly, machine learning approaches based on two-dimensional molecular information (e.g., binary fingerprints) often outperform those using three-dimensional (3D) information, possibly due to the usage of minimum-energy conformations. This raises questions about how to incorporate more sophisticated three-dimensional information (e.g., ligand flexibility and binding-induced conformational changes) for bioactivity prediction. To this end, we systematically investigate whether coordinates derived from molecular dynamics (MD) can improve prediction performance over minimum-energy conformations. MD-derived coordinates capture dynamic molecular interactions, which are hypothesized to reflect a more realistic representation of ligand-protein binding events. Using over 2600 protein-ligand complexes across three macromolecular targets, we compared multiple machine learning approaches using well-established 3D descriptor sets. Surprisingly, our results show that MD-derived coordinates do not consistently outperform ‘static’ 3D structures, despite their ability to capture dynamic molecular interactions. These findings highlight the persistent challenge of effectively leveraging three-dimensional and dynamic information for bioactivity prediction and underscore the need for improved representations approaches to bridge this gap.

# A systematic and general machine learning approach to build a consistent data set from different experiments: application to the thermal conductivity of methane

## 一种系统且通用的机器学习方法，用于从不同的实验中构建一致的数据集: 应用于甲烷的热导率

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-g6bsl-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Luiz Octavio, Pereira

Experimental data from different sources present challenges due to variability and noise from various experimental conditions, apparatuses, and environmental factors. In this work, we propose a general method to address these challenges to build a consistent data set. As a case study, we analyze experimental data sets of methane’s thermal conductivity across the liquid, vapor, and supercritical phases. The method is based on machine learning (ML) techniques, which consistently integrate data from various experimental sources compiled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database. Different ML algorithms are used for this purpose. Our findings indicate that ML models yield predictions closer to the NIST’s processed data than to the original raw experimental data used to train the models. This demonstrates the models’ generalization ability from heterogeneous, noisy, and untreated data sets. While our approach does not eliminate preprocessing, it suggests that ML can autonomously handle noisy data, providing a faster and cost-effective alternative to traditional pre- and postprocessing methods. By guiding the refinement of labor-intensive methods, ML proves adaptable for real-time data, enabling immediate adjustments and revolutionizing industrial and scientific optimizations. Therefore, the proposed ML approach is general and efficient in handling complex and heterogeneous data to deliver reliable predictions without extensive preprocessing.

**Authors:** Wolfgang, Kroutil

Reductive amination catalysed by imine reductase (IRED) and reductive aminase (RedAm) enzymes has recently been established as a powerful method for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines. While this biocatalytic technology has rapidly progressed from proof of concept to initial industrial applications, its scope and limitations remain to be fully explored. In this work, we report a broad and systematic profiling of reductive amination performance in the sequence space of IREDs and RedAms. This investigation employed an iterative strategy for activity and stereoselectivity screening, guided by chemo- and bioinformatic modelling as well as machine learning. By evaluating the catalytic performance of 175 IREDs against structurally diverse panels of 36 carbonyl compounds and 24 amines, we show that the majority of these enzymes is capable of asymmetric reductive amination at equimolar concentrations of the two substrates (50 mM each). The most effective enzymes identified in this study display sequence characteristics of RedAms, are active on 29–42% of the analysed substrate combinations, and combine high specific activities for the most favourable substrate pair (1.7−27.7 U/mgIRED) with excellent stereoselectivity. Beyond assembling this high-performance enzyme panel, we demonstrate extrapolation from our collected screening data to new substrate combinations by deep learning and the scale-up of selected reactions to a preparative batch size (10 mmol substrate, 200 mL reaction volume), delivering gram amounts of reductive amination products in high yield (63–89%) and optical purity (98% to >99% ee).

**Authors:** Andrew I., Cooper

The physical and chemical properties of molecular crystals are a combined function of molecular structure and the molecular crystal packing. Specific crystal packings can enable applications such as pharmaceuticals, organic electronics, and porous materials for gas storage. However, to design such materials, we need to predict both crystal structure and the resulting physical properties, and this is expensive using traditional computational methods. Machine-learned interatomic potential methods offer major accelerations here, but molecular crystal structure prediction remains challenging due to the weak intermolecular interactions that dictate crystal packing. Moreover, machine-learned interatomic potentials do not accelerate the prediction of all physical properties for molecular crystals. Here we present Molecular Crystal Representation from Transformers (MCRT), a transformer-based model for molecular crystal property prediction that is pre-trained on more than 700,000 experimental structures extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). MCRT employs four different pre-training tasks to extract both local and global representations from the crystals using multimodal features to encode crystal structure and geometry. MCRT has the potential to serve as a universal foundation model for predicting a range of properties for molecular crystals, achieving state-of-the-art results even when fine-tuned on small-scale datasets. We demonstrate MCRT’s practical utility in both crystal property prediction and crystal structure prediction. We also show that model predictions can be interpreted by using attention scores.

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in drug design has the potential to transform small molecule drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry, enhancing the efficiency and productivity of the drug design and discovery process. However, the manual and segmented nature of the Design, Make, Test, Analyze (DMTA) cycle is a major obstacle to any significant progress being made. The design of synthetically tractable molecules that meet project specific criteria requires a comprehensive system capable of accounting simultaneously for all synthetic constraints as well as bioactivity and physicochemical properties in order to reach an optimal outcome. The development of such an AI system is complex, requiring the integration of diverse technologies and expertise synergistically. This article outlines our vision and efforts towards the development of a unified system in which AI, ML, computational chemistry, organic chemistry, biology and human expertise converge to drive innovation in drug discovery.

# Employing the active learning strategy to construct full-dimensional  intermolecular potential energy surfaces within spectroscopic accuracy

## 采用主动学习策略在光谱精度范围内构建全维分子间势能面

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-shw8x?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Xiao-Long, Zhang

In this work, we employed an uncertainty-driven active learning strategy to achieve highly efficient point sampling for full-dimension potential energy surface constructions. The model uncertainty is defined as the weighted square energy difference between two neural network (NN) models trained with the same dataset, and the local maximums of uncertainty would be added into the training set by two criteria. A two-step sampling procedure was introduced to reduce the computational costs of expansive double-precision neural network training. The 6-D H$_2$O-He system was chosen as the test system.  A reference PES was constructed firstly by the newly developed MLRNet model with a weighted RMSE of 0.028 cm$^{-1}$, where the full-dimension long-range function was fitted by a pruned basis expansion method.  Our tests demonstrate that it is also reliable for the long-range switched fundamental invariant neural network (LS-FI-NN) to construct spectroscopically accurate PES, however, it is less inefficient for the newly developed MLRNet model. For the first single-precision sampling, the LS-FI-NN only requires 472 fitting points to achieve a weighted-RMSE of 0.3253 cm$^{-1}$ for 47945 test points. In comparison, the MLRNet requires 652 points to reach a similar accuracy.  Notably, the MLRNet demonstrated lower training errors across all sampling cycles and lower test errors in the first few cycles with less trainable parameters, which indicates its potential with an appropriate sampling procedure. For the second double-precision sampling, the LS-FI-NN achieved a test RMSD of 0.0710 cm$^{-1}$ with only 613 points, while the MLRNet can't converge to a given threshold for tens of iterations. The spectroscopic calculations were performed to further validate the accuracy of these PESs. The energy levels of the double precision LS-FI-NN showed great agreement with the reference PES's results, with only 0.0161 cm$^{-1}$ and 0.0044 cm$^{-1}$ average errors for vibrational levels and the band origin shifts.

# Clinical and MRI Markers for Acute vs Chronic TMD Using a Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approach

## 使用机器学习和深度学习方法对急性和慢性TMD进行临床和MRI标记

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5336211/latest

This study aimed to identify factors that significantly contribute to the chronicity of symptoms in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models were used for analysis. The study include 239 patients with TMD (161 women and 78 men; mean age 35.60&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;17.93 years), diagnosed using Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (Axis I). Participants were categorized into: acute TMD (&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;6 months) and chronic TMD (&amp;ge;&amp;thinsp;6 months) (51.05%). Significance clinical findings revealed that temporomandibular joint (TMJ) noise and bruxism were more frequently reported in patients with chronic TMD than in those with acute TMD. The visual analog scale (VAS) score, reflecting subjective pain intensity, was significantly higher in chronic TMD than in acute TMD. Additionally, patients with chronic TMD had shorter average sleep durations than their acute counterparts. STOP-Bang total scores were higher in chronic TMD (3.02&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;2.09 vs. 2.39&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.73, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.012) than in acute TMD. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed structural abnormalities in patients with chronic TMD, with significantly higher rates of anterior disc displacement (ADD), TMJ osteoarthritis, and joint space narrowing. Using logistic regression&amp;mdash;a widely recognized machine learning model&amp;mdash;the AUROC for predicting chronic TMD was 0.7550 (95% CI]: 0.6550&amp;ndash;0.8550). Significant predictors of chronic TMD included TMJ noise, bruxism, VAS score, sleep disturbance, STOP-Bang total score&amp;thinsp;&amp;ge;&amp;thinsp;5 (high risk of obstructive sleep apnea), ADD, and joint space narrowing. Deep learning (multilayered perceptron) improved prediction performance by 3.99% over logistic regression (79.49% vs. 75.50%, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.3067). These findings may help clinicians prevent symptom chronicity and mitigate the progression to chronic TMD, ultimately improving patient care.

# Diabe-Teach: A randomized controlled trial of a gamified approach to enhance medical undergraduates' knowledge and comprehension of diabetes mellitus

## Diabe-teach: 提高医学本科生对糖尿病知识和理解的游戏化方法的随机对照试验

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4988358/latest

The increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide necessitates that medical undergraduates acquire a deep understanding of the disease to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective management. Traditional teaching methods, while foundational, often lack the interactive elements that enhance student engagement and knowledge retention. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel educational board game, "Diabe-teach," in enhancing knowledge retention among medical students compared with conventional self-study methods. A randomized controlled design involving 56 preclinical medical students at Dubai Medical College for Girls was used. The participants were randomly assigned to either the game-based learning group or the control group, with both groups receiving identical instructional materials on diabetes. Knowledge retention was assessed via pre- and post-test scores, whereas student engagement and perceptions were measured via a feedback survey. The results indicated that while both groups showed significant improvement in post-test scores (p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;.001), the game-based group demonstrated a notably greater frequency of correct responses and a greater tendency to recognize knowledge gaps, as evidenced by the increased "I do not know" responses compared with incorrect guesses in the control group. Feedback from the game-based learning group highlighted enhanced confidence, improved communication skills, and a preference for the gamified approach over traditional methods. The findings suggest that the "Diabe-teach" board game is an effective tool for teaching complex medical concepts, fostering both knowledge retention and critical self-assessment among students. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on game-based learning, supporting its potential as a valuable adjunct to traditional medical education methods. Further research could explore the application of this approach across other medical disciplines.

Person Re-identification(ReID) aims to generate a discriminative description model to search the probe person from the gallery images.Previous methods infer the ReID model by constructing the metric learning between the visual space and the annotated label space. Moreover, the textual knowledge inferred by the visual-language model is introduced in CLIP-ReID to enhance the descriptive ability of the ReID model. However, the textual knowledge inferred from the pre-trained visual space has less discriminative ability on ReID tasks.To address the above issue, we propose a novel Visual-Textual Adversarial Learning(VTAL) for person ReID.The primary concept of VTAL is to construct an adversarial loop between the visual encoder and the text encoder, leveraging the progressive enhancement of one encoder to improve the performance of the other within this loop.Two types of prompts(Task-Independent prompt and Task-Related prompt) are deployed to maintain the generalization ability and discrimination ability of the generated textual-level identity embedding simultaneously.After that, the generated corresponding identity embeddings are treated as a textual-to-visual constraint to optimize the visual encoder.Extensive experiments on three benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for person ReID..

# DeEPsnap: human essential gene prediction by integrating multi-omics data

## DeEPsnap: 通过整合多组学数据预测人类必需基因

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5390345/latest

Essential genes are necessary for the survival or reproduction of a living organism. The prediction and analysis of gene essentiality can advance our understanding of basic life and human diseases, and further boost the development of new drugs. Wet lab methods for identifying cell essential genes are often costly, time-consuming, and laborious. As a complement, computational methods have been proposed to predict essential genes by integrating multiple biological data sources. Most of these methods are evaluated on model organisms. However, prediction methods for human essential genes are still limited and the relationship between human gene essentiality and different biological information still needs to be explored. In addition, exploring suitable deep learning techniques to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning methods and improve prediction accuracy is also important and interesting. We propose a snapshot ensemble deep neural network method, DeEPsnap, to predict human essential genes. DeEPsnap integrates sequence features derived from DNA and protein sequence data with features extracted or learned from multiple types of functional data, such as gene ontology, protein complex, protein domain, and protein-protein interaction network. More than 200 features from these biological data are extracted/learned which are integrated together to train a series of cost-sensitive deep neural networks by utilizing multiple deep learning techniques. The proposed snapshot mechanism enables us to train multiple models without increasing extra training effort and cost. The experimental results of 10-fold cross-validation show that DeEPsnap can accurately predict human gene essentiality with an average AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) of 96.1%, the average AUPRC (Area under the Precision-Recall curve) of 93.82%, the average accuracy of 92.21%, and the average F1 measure about 80.62%. In addition, the comparison of experimental results shows that DeEPsnap outperforms several popular traditional machine learning models and deep learning models. We have demonstrated that the proposed method, DeEPsnap, is effective for predicting human essential genes.

## 智慧保护: 深度学习驱动的苏州历史砖石建筑病理检测与分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5454513/latest

Suzhou's modern masonry buildings hold substantial historical significance, yet they face escalating risks of deterioration due to regional climate fluctuations and anthropogenic influences. Prompt detection of these issues is essential for effective conservation and restoration. This paper addresses this need by integrating UAV technology with deep learning models to enhance the detection of building pathologies, focusing on five categories: material loss (ML), discoloration and deposits (DD), cracks (CR), surface spalling (SS), and biological invasion (BI). The method integrated 3D scanning and oblique photogrammetry to enable automated facade analysis, effectively addressing the limitations of manual inspection. As a case study, the historical site of Soochow Hospital was examined to demonstrate the practical application of quantifying pathology data. 1,200 facade images were collected, including 781 used for pathology detection. The model&amp;rsquo;s detection accuracies for each pathology type were as follows: biological invasion (75.6%), discoloration and deposits (43.1%), cracks (46.5%), and surface spalling (48.5%), demonstrating the model's capability to meet basic conservation requirements. This approach ultimately provides valuable technical support for the preservation of Suzhou's masonry buildings and offers new insights into the conservation of modern masonry heritage.

# Association of Fluid Balance Index with In-Hospital Mortality in Critically Ill Patients with Acute Pancreatitis: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study

## 重症急性胰腺炎患者液体平衡指数与院内死亡率的关系: 一项多中心回顾性队列研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5382710/latest

Fluid resuscitation is critical in managing acute pancreatitis (AP), yet both excessive and insufficient resuscitation can lead to poor outcomes. This multicenter retrospective cohort study investigated the relationship between the fluid balance index (FBI) and in-hospital mortality in critically ill AP patients. In total, 547 AP patients from the MIMIC-IV database and 91 patients from our center were classified into high-risk (FBI&amp;thinsp;&amp;ge;&amp;thinsp;145) and low-risk (FBI&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;145) groups. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. The in-hospital mortality rate observed in the MIMIC-IV cohort was 8.96%. Machine learning analysis identified FBI as a key predictor of mortality. Multivariable Cox regression showed that patients with an FBI&amp;thinsp;&amp;ge;&amp;thinsp;145 had significantly increased in-hospital mortality (HR&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1.99, 95% CI 1.08&amp;ndash;3.69) and 28-day mortality (HR&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;2.90, 95% CI 1.50&amp;ndash;5.64). Propensity score matching minimized baseline differences, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated higher mortality in the high-risk group (p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.05), consistent in our center&amp;rsquo;s cohort. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a near-linear increase in mortality with rising FBI (p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.05), confirmed by subgroup analysis. In conclusion, FBI is strongly associated with in-hospital mortality in critically ill AP patients, underscoring its potential to inform fluid resuscitation strategies.

# Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks Identify Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease from Spectrogram Images of Voice Samples

## 预训练的卷积神经网络从语音样本的频谱图图像中识别帕金森氏病

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5348708/latest

Machine learning approaches including deep learning models have shown promising performance in the automatic detection of Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease. These approaches rely on different types of data with voice recordings being the most used due to the convenient and non-invasive nature of data acquisition. Our group has successfully developed a novel approach that uses convolutional neural network with transfer learning to analyze spectrogram images of the sustained vowel /a/ to identify people with Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease. We tested this approach by collecting a dataset of voice recordings via telephone lines, which have limited bandwidth. This study builds upon our prior results in two major ways: First, we tested the performance of our approach on a larger voice dataset recorded using smartphones with wide bandwidth. Our results show comparable performance between two datasets generated using different recording platforms where we report differences in most important features resulting from the limited bandwidth of telephonic lines. Second, we compared the classification performance achieved using linear-scale and mel-scale spectrogram images and showed a small but statistically significant gain using mel-scale spectrograms. The convolutional neural network with transfer learning approach showed superior performance against conventional machine learning methods that collapse measurements across time to generate feature vectors.

# Patient and provider perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis healthcare access and delivery: A qualitative study of the complexities of a pandemic within a pandemic

## 患者和提供者对COVID-19对结核病医疗保健获取和提供的影响的看法: 对大流行中大流行复杂性的定性研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5656441/latest

Objective: We aimed to explore patient and provider perspectives of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tuberculosis healthcare access and service delivery.
Methods: We used Interpretive Description, a qualitative approach with the end-goal of informing decisions and actions in clinical practice. Levesque et al.&rsquo;s &ldquo;Conceptual framework of access to health care&rdquo; informed the development of our interview guides. Interviews were conducted virtually and confidentially transcribed verbatim. Data generation and analysis occurred concurrently. Analysis was informed by Braun and Clarke&rsquo;s six phases of reflexive thematic analysis. Strategies to enhance rigour and trustworthiness of the findings were utilized.
Results: We completed 15 interviews: 6 with patients and 9 with providers. Three key themes were generated: (a) Diagnostic hurdles created delay; (b) Hybrid services promote health equity; and (c) Navigating the complexities of a pandemic within a pandemic. Diagnosing tuberculosis was challenging even prior to the pandemic since some providers lacked experience and familiarity with the condition. The diagnostic process was further complicated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, COVID-19 also introduced streamlined virtual care for patients which was convenient and improved access but was not viewed as being equivalent to in-person care. The intersection of the COVID-19 and tuberculosis pandemics created competition for limited resources while highlighting learnings that may positively impact future tuberculosis care.
Conclusions: Our findings can inform health system leadership about how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted care of other public health threats like tuberculosis, helping to prepare more effectively and equitably for future challenges.

# Research on Electromagnetic Tomography Method for Imaging Reinforcement Structures in Concrete Utility Poles Based on an Improved VGG16 Deep Learning Network

## 基于改进VGG16深度学习网络的混凝土电线杆内钢筋结构电磁层析成像方法研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5361606/latest

Concrete utility poles are extensively utilized in the load-bearing structures of low-voltage distribution lines, where the quality of the internal reinforcement directly impacts their reliability and supports the stable operation of the distribution network. Non-destructive testing of these poles aids maintenance personnel in understanding the internal structure of the reinforcements, evaluating the performance of the poles, and ensuring their reliable operation. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a method for imaging the reinforcement structure of concrete utility poles using electromagnetic tomography. This method involves evenly dis-tributing 32 threaded coils on the surface of the pole, employing adjacent excitation methods to stimulate the coils and measure their voltage. The measurement data from the poles are inputted into an enhanced VGG16 neural network, trained with finite element data, to reconstruct the reinforcement structure. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed through simulation experiments, which demonstrated its ability to accurately image reinforcement structures with varying numbers of rebars, burial depths, diameters, and missing rebars, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities. While the generalizability of the model decreases when the rebar count is fixed during dataset construction, imaging performance improves for specific pole models. The reinforcement imaging method proposed in this paper enhances the efficiency of maintenance operations and offers new perspectives for the inspection of reinforcement structures in concrete utility poles.

Background The pressing global health issue of heart failure (HF) demands innovative approaches for early detection. Non-invasive, rapid, and cost-effective deep learning (DL)-based techniques offer a promising avenue for addressing this challenge.
Methods A total of 462 participants were categorized into three groups: healthy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and heart failure (HF). Raw radial artery pulse wave data were collected from each participant, followed by preprocessing steps including denoising, normalization, and balancing. Subsequently, four deep learning (DL) algorithms were applied to the processed data: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM).
Results LSTM achieved the highest classification performance, with an accuracy of 0.8587, precision of 0.87448, recall of 0.82164, F1-score of 0.83773, specificity of 0.92369, and AUC of 0.93365. Given its superior performance across all metrics, LSTM emerges as the preferred DL model for this study.
Conclusion By employing LSTM to analyze radial artery pulse wave, we can accurately distinguish between healthy individuals, patients with CAD, and those with HF. This simple, non-invasive, and cost-effective method presents a potential strategy for early detection of HF.

One of the common challenges in image satellite classification prediction models is obtaining high accuracy, and from this perspective, the primary objective of this paper is to implement the Stacked Learning Model (SLM) technique with the aim of enhancing the accuracy of image classification. Academic research and practical applications have widely used the suggested model, which has made significant strides in the field of image classification. By using a SLM, the model combined the results of three base models to improve the predictive ability and accuracy of image classification. This approach had been applied in a series of sequential steps designed to improve the performance of individual models and their integration. The proposed model uses the EuroSat dataset, which includes images. These images are of high resolution and cover various land use and land cover classes across Europe. They have been evenly distributed across six classes: residential, permanent crop, pasture, industrial, highway, and forest. This data has been augmented to reduce the problem of overfitting and improve the model&amp;rsquo;s ability to generalize. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 92.35% after training, confirming its robustness in image classification applications, particularly in areas where accuracy is crucial. Various comparisons, even with state-of-the-art models, will be provided.

# Exploring the Significance of Physical Activity to Enhance Quality of Life Among Hemiplegic Elderly: A Novel Approach Using Mixed-Methods Grounded Theory (MM-GT)

## 探索身体活动对提高偏瘫老年人生活质量的意义: 一种使用混合方法扎根理论 (mm-gt) 的新方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5456673/latest

Background Elderly stroke survivors commonly live a sedentary life with some degree of mobility disability despite their independent functional ability in performing activities of daily living (ADL) and ambulation. The perception and meanings given to physical activity (PA) play a significant role in promoting active aging for better quality of life (QoL). This study aims to explore the QoL-related meanings of PA given by hemiplegic older adults living in Thailand's rural community to construct an explorative theoretical model.Methods A mixed-methods grounded theory (MM-GT) exploratory embedded research design was used with case-by-case purposive theoretical sampling for qualitative data collection and grounded analysis from community-dwelling elderlies who were hemiplegic stroke survivors. Quantifying the PA level of respondents was embedded using Global Physical Activity Questionnaires (GPAQ), whereas World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) were used for measuring functional impacts and QoL.Results The constructive theoretical model displayed three hierarchical meaningful PA categories. Firstly, initial PA refers to activities that positively drive to more independent living and negatively drive to avoid burdening the family. Secondly, identity PA refers to what they do regarding the accountabilities of prior family roles instead of living a sedentary and empty life. Thirdly, optimizing PA is defined as what PAs do to maintain and balance their meaningful existence within the wider community. The more meaningful PA was the more possibility to turn into action and contribute to the QoL of elderly hemiplegic stroke survivors. The MM-GT exploratory embedded research design with the lens of the Theory of Everything (TOE) helped to disclose the multidimensional QoL-related meanings of the PA behaviors of older people with mobility disability. Meanwhile, the Social Cognitive Learning Theory (SCLT) enhanced its learning property and explanatory power.Conclusions These findings have significant implications for geriatrics, rehabilitation, and public health areas, providing insights into the role of meaningful PA in improving the QoL of elderly stroke survivors and using it as a strategy for promoting active aging and improving QoL within their living community. The gender distribution of respondents and the particular semi-urban context of this study limited its generalizability.

# Combined Nomogram for Differentiating Adrenal Pheochromocytoma from Large-Diameter Lipid-poor Adenoma Using Multiphase CT Radiomics and clinico-radiological features

## 使用多相CT影像组学和临床放射学特征将肾上腺嗜铬细胞瘤与大直径脂质贫乏的腺瘤区分开来的组合列线图

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5430091/latest

Background and Objective: Adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are predominantly adrenal adenomas (80%), with a smaller proportion (7%) being pheochromocytomas(PHEO). Adenomas are typically non-functional tumors managed through observation or medication, with some cases requiring surgical removal, which is generally safe. In contrast, PHEO secrete catecholamines, causing severe blood pressure fluctuations, making surgical resection the only treatment option. Without adequate preoperative preparation, perioperative mortality risk is significantly high.A specialized adrenal CT scanning protocol is recommended to differentiate between these tumor types. However, distinguishing patients with similar washout characteristics remains challenging, and concerns about efficiency, cost, and risk limit its feasibility. Recently, radiomics has demonstrated efficacy in identifying molecular-level differences in tumor cells, including adrenal tumors. This study develops a combined nomogram model, integrating key clinical-radiological and radiomic features from multiphase CT, to enhance accuracy in distinguishing pheochromocytoma from large-diameter lipid-poor adrenal adenoma (LP-AA).Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 202 patients with pathologically confirmed adrenal PHEO and large-diameter LP-AA from three tertiary care centers. Key clinico-radiological and radiomics features were selected to construct models: a clinico-radiological model, a radiomics model, and a combined nomogram model for predicting these two tumor types. Model performance and robustness were evaluated using external validation, calibration curve analysis, machine learning techniques, and Delong's test. Additionally, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, decision curve analysis, and five-fold cross-validation were employed to assess the clinical translational potential of the combined nomogram model.Results All models demonstrated high diagnostic performance, with AUC values exceeding 0.8 across all cohorts, confirming their reliability. The combined nomogram model exhibited the highest diagnostic accuracy, with AUC values of 0.994, 0.979, and 0.945 for the training, validation, and external test cohorts, respectively. Notably, the unenhanced combined nomogram model was not significantly inferior to the three-phase combined nomogram model (p&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;0.05 in the validation and test cohorts; p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.049 in the training cohort).Conclusions The combined nomogram model reliably distinguishes between PHEO and LP-AA, shows strong clinical translational potential, and may reduce the need for contrast-enhanced CT scans.

# Turning Failures into Opportunities? Unexpected Outcomes of a Failure-Reframing Intervention

## 将失败转化为机遇？失败重构干预的意外结果

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5660898/latest

Reframing failures as an opportunity for learning rather than a sign of fixed ability is a prominent element in a variety of growth mindset interventions &amp;ndash; interventions that have enhanced people&amp;rsquo;s performance, interest, and well-being by highlighting that people can grow their abilities. We investigated the isolated effect of this treatment. Would an intervention solely focusing on reframing failures improve outcomes? To test this, we conducted a reframing-failure intervention in a longitudinal randomized-controlled experiment with a relatively large sample of students (N&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;389) in a competitive computer science program over one semester. Surprisingly, the intervention did not have any significant positive effects. Exploratory analyses even show evidence of negative effects on students&amp;rsquo; well-being. Possible explanations for findings are discussed. Broadly, results point to potential limitations of isolated reframing-failure messages.

# Effects of acute pro-inflammatory stimulation and 25-hydroxycholesterol on hippocampal plasticity &amp;amp; learning involve NLRP3 inflammasome and cellular stress responses

## 急性促炎刺激和25-羟基胆固醇对海马可塑性和学习的影响涉及NLRP3炎性体和细胞应激反应

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5589790/latest

Neuroinflammation is an increasingly important target for therapeutics in neuropsychiatry and contributes to cognitive dysfunction, disability and death across a range of illnesses. We previously found that acute effects of pro-inflammatory stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity involved in learning and memory, requires synthesis of the oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) and exogenous 25HC mimics effects of LPS. However, downstream mechanisms engaged by LPS and 25HC remain uncertain. Here we use rat hippocampal slices and in vivo behavioral studies to provide evidence that acute modulation of synaptic plasticity by both LPS and 25HC requires activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase-1 and interleukin-1 receptor. Furthermore, both LPS and 25HC engage cellular stress responses including synthesis of 5a-reduced neurosteroids and effects on plasticity are prevented by modulators of these responses. In studies of acute learning using a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task, inhibition of learning by LPS and 25HC are prevented by pre-treatment with an inhibitor of NLRP3. The present studies provide strong support for the role of 25HC as a mediator of pro-inflammatory stimulation on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and for the importance of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activation in the deleterious effects of acute inflammation.

# The mediating role of trait mental fatigue in cognitive decline among PwMS: Implications for verbal memory and information processing speed

## 特质心理疲劳在PwMS认知衰退中的中介作用: 对言语记忆和信息处理速度的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5515189/latest

Trait mental fatigue (MF) and cognitive dysfunction significantly impair the quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), particularly impacting information processing speed (IPS) and verbal learning-memory (VL/M). We assessed 66 PwMS and 38 healthy controls (HC) via the oral form of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT-Of) for IPS, the Greek Verbal Learning Test (GVLT) for VL/M, and the cognitive subscale of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS-c) for MF. This aimed at investigating the mediating role of MF in the relationship between IPS and VL/M in PwMS. PwMS performed significantly worse than HC across all domains. Mediation analysis, controlling for age, sex, education, disease duration, and MS-type, revealed a significant effect of IPS on VL/M in PwMS. This effect became non-significant once MF was introduced, whereas the indirect effect of IPS on VL/M through MF remained significant. No significant mediation effects were observed in HC, even after controlling for age, sex, and education, underscoring the unique impact of MF on MS. This study highlights the mediating role of trait MF in cognitive deficits among PwMS, suggesting that interventions targeting MF could enhance cognitive performance. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04806568 (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04806568).

# Me-LLaMA: Medical Foundation Large Language Models for Comprehensive Text Analysis and Beyond

## Me-LLaMA: 医学基金会大型语言模型，用于全面的文本分析和超越

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5456223/latest

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA have shown significant potential in medical applications, but their effectiveness is limited by a lack of specialized medical knowledge due to general-domain training. In this study, we developed Me-LLaMA, a new family of open-source medical LLMs that uniquely integrate extensive domain-specific knowledge with robust instruction-following capabilities. Me-LLaMA comprises foundation models (Me-LLaMA 13B and 70B) and their chat-enhanced versions, developed through comprehensive continual pretraining and instruction tuning of LLaMA2 models using both biomedical literature and clinical notes. Me-LLaMA utilized the largest and most comprehensive medical data, including 129B pre-training tokens and 214K instruction tuning samples from diverse biomedical and clinical data sources. Training the 70B models required substantial computational resources, exceeding 100,000 A100 GPU hours. We applied Me-LLaMA to six medical text analysis tasks and evaluated its performance on 12 benchmark datasets. To further assess Me-LLaMA&rsquo;s potential clinical utility, we evaluated its performance on complex clinical case diagnosis compared with other commercial LLMs, using both automatic and human evaluations. Me-LLaMA models outperform LLaMA, and other existing open-source medical LLMs in both zero-shot and supervised learning settings for most text analysis tasks. With task-specific instruction tuning, Me-LLaMA models also surpass leading commercial LLMs, outperforming ChatGPT on 7 out of 8 datasets and GPT-4 on 5 out of 8 datasets. Moreover, Me-LLaMA&rsquo;s performance is comparable to ChatGPT and GPT-4 for diagnosing complex clinical cases. Our findings underscore combining domain-specific continual pretraining with instruction tuning is essential for developing effective domain-specific large language models in healthcare, significantly enhancing performance across diverse medical text analysis tasks and applications. By publicly releasing our models and resources under appropriate user agreements, we aim to foster innovation and facilitate advancements in medical AI, benefiting researchers and practitioners within the community.

# PPP5C pathogenic variant identified: a potential key to gaining insight into developmental and epileptic encephalopathy?

## 确定了PPP5C致病变异: 深入了解发育性和癫痫性脑病的潜在关键？

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5442441/latest

Background Emerging evidence suggesting a possible link between the PPP5C gene (Protein Phosphatase 5 Catalytic Subunit; OMIM#600658) and developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE, OMIM#308350), although the clinical significance of pathogenic variants in this gene remains unclear. PPP5C is a member of the protein phosphatase catalytic subunit family, which is involved in various signaling pathways governing cell growth, differentiation, and responses to hormonal signals or cellular stress. To date, only one case with a PPP5C variant has been reported, associated with a severe neurological phenotype, including microcephaly, failure to thrive, and early-onset seizures.Results We report a 12-year-old girl affected by epilepsy and learning disorders. At the age of five, she presented convulsive status epilepticus with respiratory failure at onset and she started anticonvulsant therapy with Levetiracetam with a significant improvement. Genetic analysis revealed a de novo heterozygous missense variant of PPP5C gene (c.202C&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;T: p.Arg68Cys), which had not been previously described in the literature.Conclusion This case expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with PPP5C variants, highlighting the potential role of this gene in neurological disorders. Our findings may provide some valuable insights into the spectrum of phenotypic manifestations linked to this gene less investigated in neuropediatrics.

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5453741/latest

Background: Ceramides play a crucial role in atherosclerosis progression and have been linked to cardiovascular events. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between serum ceramide levels and Acute coronary syndrome, as well as evaluate their potential for predicting ACS in Chinese population.
Methods: Data of 1327 patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease from Beijing anzhen Hospital and Handan First hospital were collected. Plasma ceramide were measured using the LC-MS/MS system. The area under the ROC curve was used to screen the most valuable predictor. Machine learning algorithms were used to identify critical ACS-related variables. Subgroup analysis and interaction test were performed to control for confounding factors. Multivariate Logistic models and restricted cubic spline analysis were conducted to examine the associations between Ceramide and ACS.
Results: Cer (d18:1/14:0), Cer (d18:1/16:0), Cer (d18:1/18:0), Cer (d18:1/20:0), Cer (d18:1/22:0), and Cer (d18:1/24:0) were significantly elevated in the ACS group. Diagnostic performance assessments showed that Cer(d18:1/16:0) had superior accuracy in detecting ACS compared to other ceramides tested. The Boruta algorithm identified 15 significant variables related to ACS. Cer(d18:1/16:0) associated with ACS were discovered using the LASSO logistic regression technique. Subgroup analyses and logistic regression models further supported the relationship between Cer(d18:1/16:0) and ACS. &amp;nbsp;Additionally, a significant nonlinear relationship was observed &amp;nbsp;between Cer(d18:1/16:0) and ACS, with a threshold of 150umol/L.
Conclusion: The study found that ceramides, particularly Cer(d18:1/16:0), were significantly associated with ACS and could be a potential biomarker for predicting and diagnosing ACS in Chinese populations experiencing chest pain.

# Predicting Lung Health with High-Performance Machine Learning: Insights from Upper Respiratory Microbiome Biomarkers

## 通过高性能机器学习预测肺部健康: 来自上呼吸道微生物组生物标志物的见解

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5402370/latest

BACKGROUND The major importance of upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome diversity to the overall aerodigestive tract made it an ideal hotspot to determine lung health. However, the current sampling methods pose a bottleneck for large scale lung examination, as they are either invasive such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), or inconsistent like sputum. As COVID-19 pushes innovation for mass surveillance, the self-collected gargle sampling method gained popularity as it is non-invasive, convenient, and requires minimum sampling skill. Combined by the power of sequencing technology and machine learning (ML) algorithms, gargle specimen analysis could be the novel approach for lung health surveillance. Here, we carried out shotgun metagenomics study to compare microbiome diversity between sputum and gargle specimens from 3 subject&amp;rsquo;s lung health groups, namely healthy, acute, and chronic. We also discovered biomarkers driving microbiome differences in healthy-chronic subjects and used that insight to develop ML based predictive models.RESULTS We found that influence of specimen types on microbiome diversity is significantly inconsequential compared to that of subjects&amp;rsquo; health. Our biomarker analysis revealed higher commensals abundance in healthy samples, as well as pathogens predominance in chronic subjects. By using this insight, our prediction models achieve an excellent discriminatory power to distinguish healthy subjects from chronic patients.CONCLUSION Findings in our study demonstrated feasibility of ML-based gargle analysis as an alternative lung health surveillance approach.

## 从事骨科手术的医学生的学术资源偏好

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5349756/latest

PURPOSE: This study explores the preferences of academic materials favored by medical students pursuing orthopaedic surgery. It aims to assess how these resources are perceived in terms of their utility in both pre-clinical education and clinical rotations. Additionally, the study explores the potential significance of visual mnemonics, a resource currently underrepresented in orthopaedic education.
METHODS: Deidentified electronic surveys, using the web-based platform SurveyMonkey, were distributed via national medical student orthopedic societies and medical student orthopedic interest groups. The surveys included multiple choice questions prompting respondents to rate their perceived usefulness of various educational resources, and their responses were analyzed using non-parametric statistical methods.
RESULTS: Significant variations in resource preferences were identified across subjects. A consistent consensus was held that board reviews, question banks, and flashcards have greater utility compared to textbooks and lectures for pre-clinical subjects. A similar pattern emerged for clinical rotation resources with direct patient care, review resources, question banks, and flashcards being favored over conventional instructional methods. Visual mnemonics demonstrated efficacy in subjects demanding memorization-intensive efforts and most respondents expressed their belief that visual mnemonics would be useful in their orthopaedic studies.
CONCLUSION: The transition from conventional lecture-based instruction to dynamic, interactive learning approaches is a hallmark of modern medical education. This research provides strong evidence that medical students aspiring to become orthopaedic surgeons have a pronounced preference for active learning resources. These insights offer valuable guidance for refining educational strategies tailored to orthopaedic surgery candidates, potentially bolstering their success in securing positions in this competitive field.

# Exploring Personalized Diagnosis and Intervention in Binge Eating Disorder: Five Case Reports

## 探索暴食症的个性化诊断和干预: 五例病例报告

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5425163/latest

Background Binge Eating Disorder (BED) has gained attention in recent years due to its complexity and the challenges it poses in diagnosis and treatment. Unlike other eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, BED has been less researched, particularly regarding the influence of genetic factors. This study introduces a novel approach by individually analyzing how genetic predisposition impacts the diagnosis of BED, which in turn contributes to the development of more personalized and effective treatments. The primary objective of this research was to demonstrate the diagnostic variability and intervention possibilities in patients with BED, highlighting the importance of an interdisciplinary approach. Additionally, it aimed to identify individual factors&amp;mdash;clinical, psychosocial, and genetic&amp;mdash;that influence the presence of the disorder, and to evaluate the efficacy of personalized treatments that include psychological, psychiatric, and nutritional interventions tailored to each patient's unique needs.Case presentation: The main concerns of the patients were how to manage their food-related anxiety. Many felt stigmatized by their weight and guilty for being unable to control their binge eating, which they initially attributed to a lack of self-control. However, upon learning about their genetic profile, patients began to better understand their eating behaviors, allowing them to reduce the associated guilt. Clinically, it was observed that after receiving interdisciplinary treatment, which included both psychological interventions and precision nutritional management, binge eating episodes significantly decreased. In four out of five cases, binge eating disappeared completely.Conclusions This reinforces the importance of tailoring treatments to the genetic and psychosocial specifics of each patient, opening new research opportunities and improving the therapeutic approach for BED.

## 用于预测尼日利亚西南部年轻人中的性传播疾病的机器学习模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5404906/latest

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are diseases which are spread between individuals through unprotected sexual contact. The spread has become rampant, especially among the youths nowadays who display promiscuous characteristics, which leads to a faster rate of the spread of the disease among the youths. Thus, this study aims to develop a machine learning model for an accurate analysis and prediction of the transmission rate of STDs among the youth within the southwestern region of Nigeria. For an approximate and optimize study, a questionnaire in Google form was administered to harvest opinions of youths within the stated demographic with respect to their health status, disease awareness, lifestyle choices and other characteristics. The collected primary dataset of 529 individual responses was used to build the machine learning model. The dataset was converted to comma-separated values (CSV) format to be trained and tested for a well-supervised machine learning model. Of the data collected, 75% served as training data and 25% served as testing data. Feature extraction, data visualization and data preprocessing were done to convert raw data into suitable machine learning. Taking from the results, a decision tree accuracy of 0.9393 with an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.5843, logistic regression accuracy of 0.9621 with AUC score of 0.5, support vector machine accuracy of 0.96212 with AUC score of 0.5 and Gaussian Na&amp;iuml;ve Bayers machine learning algorithms accuracy score of 0.5909 with AUC score of 0.7874 were obtained. Hence, the Gaussian Na&amp;iuml;ve Bayers gave the best outcomes with an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.79 and was able to correctly classify all 5 cases of STDs within the test set as compared to other algorithms.

# Proteome Profiling of Serum Reveals Pathological Mechanisms and Biomarker Candidates for Cerebral Small Vessel Disease

## 血清蛋白质组分析揭示脑小血管病的病理机制和候选生物标志物

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5439901/latest

Background Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a global brain disorder that is characterized by a series of clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological manifestations. However, the molecular pathophysiological mechanisms of CSVD have not been thoroughly investigated. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics has broad application prospects in biomedicine. It is used to elucidate disease-related molecular processes and pathophysiological pathways, thus providing an important opportunity to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of CSVD.Methods  Serum samples were obtained from 96 participants (58 with CSVD and 38 controls) consecutively recruited from The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. After removing high-abundance proteins, the serum samples were analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Bioinformatics methods were used for in-depth analysis of the obtained proteomic data, and the results were verified experimentally.Results Compared with the control group, 52 proteins were differentially expressed in the sera of the CSVD group. Furthermore, analyses indicated the involvement of these differentially expressed proteins in CSVD through participation in the overactivation of complement and coagulation cascades and dysregulation of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins. The proteomic biomarker panel identified by the machine learning model combined with clinical features is expected to facilitate the diagnosis of CSVD (AUC&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.947,95% CI&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.895&amp;ndash;0.978).Conclusions The study is the most in-depth study on CSVD proteomics to date, and suggests that the overactivation of the complement cascade and the dysregulation of IGFBP on- IGF may be closely correlated with the occurrence and progression of CSVD, offering the potential to develop peripheral blood biomarkers and providing new insights into the biological basis of CSVD.

# Deep learning algorithms enable MRI-based scapular morphology analysis with values comparable to CT-based assessments

## 深度学习算法可实现基于MRI的肩胛骨形态分析，其值可与基于CT的评估相媲美

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5361862/latest

Scapular morphological attributes show promise as prognostic indicators of retear following rotator cuff repair. Current evaluation techniques using single-slice magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) are, however, prone to error, while more accurate computed tomography (CT)-based three-dimensional techniques, are limited by cost and radiation exposure. In this study we propose deep learning-based methods that enable automatic scapular morphological analysis from diagnostic MRI despite the anisotropic resolution and reduced field of view, compared to CT. A deep learning-based segmentation network was trained with paired CT derived scapula segmentations. An algorithm to fuse multi-plane segmentations was developed to generated high-resolution 3D models of the scapula on which morphological landmark- and axes were predicted using a second deep learning network for morphological analysis. Using the proposed methods, the critical shoulder angle, glenoid inclination and version were measured from MRI with accuracies of -1.3&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.7 degrees, 1.3&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;2.1 degree, and &amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1.4&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;3.4 degrees respectively, compared to CT. Inter-class correlation between MRI and CT derived metrics were substantial for the glenoid version and almost perfect for the other metrics. This study demonstrates how deep learning can overcome reduced resolution, bone border contrast and field of view, to enable 3D scapular morphology analysis on MRI.

# Predictive Modeling for Healthcare: Leveraging Categorical and Binary Data for Enhanced Accuracy

## 医疗保健预测建模: 利用分类和二进制数据提高准确性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5529811/latest

Such dramatic growth in healthcare data has increased the necessity of developing predictive models capable of manipulating and processing categorical and binary data, which would constitute significant improvements in the predictability of diseases and patient management strategies. Traditional statistical approaches such as Logistic Regression have been utilized frequently but often fail when managing these complex relationships inherent to large health care datasets. Several studies recently shown that, in comparison with traditional methods, advanced machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, CatBoost, and Gradient Boosting can better capture complex, non-linear patterns and data interactions toward a high level of predictive accuracy. This paper systematically applies and evaluates these new techniques on healthcare datasets while focusing on the optimization of main performance metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Experimental results demonstrate that ensemble models, especially CatBoost, outperform traditional models in terms of prediction accuracy, and thus can be adapted to robust solutions in patient risk classification and early detection of diseases. The findings imply the importance of advanced machine learning methods in supporting the personalization of treatment plans and allocation of resources, leading towards exact, data-driven decision-making in healthcare systems.

# A New Auxetic Structure-based Hybrid Gripperfor Harvesting Tomato-like Soft Fruits

## 一种新的基于拉胀结构的杂交夹具，用于收获番茄状的软果实

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5469341/latest

Modern agriculture is reaping the benefits of automation by harvesting fruits and vegetables using robots that have adaptive grasping force depending on the compliance or softness of the fruit or vegetable. The successful operation of fruit picking using a robotic system with a gripper as an end effector hinges on its manipulation capability and ability to interact safely with the crop without affecting its physical properties. In this paper, we have proposed a novel hybrid gripper with six soft, passive auxetic structures attached to the rigid linkage, which has high shape conformability during the grasping of tomatoes through caging. The gripper is actuated through a scotch-yoke mechanism using a servo motor. A deep learning-based fruit localization algorithm has been developed to perform the picking operation of tomatoes through the gripper. A ROS-based framework has been used to control the robotic arm to achieve an optimized trajectory for fruit picking and to control the desired grasping forces along with the actuation of the pedicel cutter.

# Active learning algorithm for alleviating the user cold start problem of recommender systems

## 缓解推荐系统用户冷启动问题的主动学习算法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5377882/latest

A key challenge in recommender systems is how to profile new users. A popular solution for this problem is to use active learning strategies. These strategies request ratings for a small set of carefully selected items to reveal the preferences of new users. In this paper, we propose a new decision tree-based algorithm for selecting these items. Treating the recommender system as a black box, the ratings collected from interviewing new users are passed on to the recommender system with the intention of improving its performance. Extensive offline evaluation with two data sets and various recommender algorithms shows that our algorithm does indeed improve the performance of the underlying recommender algorithm if users are able to rate most of the items that are presented to them during the interview. However, online evaluation with 50 real users could not prove that our algorithm does indeed have a positive impact on the performance of the underlying recommender algorithm. This reveals the discrepancy between offline and online evaluations of active learning techniques applied in the context of recommender systems. This is due to the fact that real users are not always able to rate the item selected by the active learning algorithm and therefore cannot provide the requested information, in contrast to many machine learning scenarios were the labeling of all samples is possible. Hence, further research is required to provide more certainty regarding the impact of active learning strategies on recommender algorithms.

# Small Fishing boat classification and recognition method based on GASF temporal graph coding and EMPViT model

## 基于GASF时序图编码和EMPViT模型的小型渔船分类识别方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5133252/latest

Efficient management of small vessels is crucial for maritime operations, and effective classification and identification algorithms for small fishing vessels are key to enhancing ship management. This paper proposes a classification and recognition method for small fishing boats based on GASF sequence diagram coding, addressing the complex and challenging recognition environment. The method focuses on four typical small fishing vessels, utilizing Gramian Summation Angular Field (GASF) time series images and the Efficiency MPViT (EMPViT) model. Unlike traditional approaches, this study initially employs a high-precision laser sensor to gather one-dimensional contour data of fishing boats. Subsequently, the polynomial fitting method is used to delineate the shape of the fishing boat contour, which is then encoded into a two-dimensional time series image using the GASF encoding method. The enhanced EMPViT model is then applied to classify and identify small fishing vessels, with the results verified through ablation experiments. These experiments demonstrate that the EMPViT model surpasses traditional neural network models such as CNN and ViT in both accuracy and performance, achieving a peak accuracy of 99.98%.

# Data-Free Pruning of CNN Using Kernel Similarity

## 基于核相似性的CNN无数据剪枝

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4919297/latest

Channel pruning can effectively compress Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for deployment on edge devices. Most existing pruning methods are data-driven, relying heavily on datasets and necessitating fine-tuning the pruned models for several epochs. However, data privacy protection increases the difficulty of getting a dataset, making data inaccessible in some scenarios. Inaccessible datasets lead to current pruning methods infeasible. To solve this issue, we propose a data-free CNN pruning method that does not require data. It involves filter reconstruction and feature reconstruction. To reduce kernels in each filter, we group the kernels in each filter based on the similarity of kernels and calculate a representative kernel for each group to reconstruct the filters. During inference, we conduct feature reconstruction to match input channels of the reconstructed filter so as to satisfy the operational criteria of convolutional neural networks. &nbsp;We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments using ResNet, MobileNet, and VGG on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For ResNet-50, we obtain FLOPs reduction of 56.2% with only Top-1 accuracy reduction of 0.52% on ImageNet.
