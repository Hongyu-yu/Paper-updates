# Illuminating new and known relations between knot invariants

## 照亮结不变量之间的新的和已知的关系

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad95d9

We automate the process of machine learning correlations between knot invariants. For nearly 200 000 distinct sets of input knot invariants together with an output invariant, we attempt to learn the output invariant by training a neural network on the input invariants. Correlation between invariants is measured by the accuracy of the neural network prediction, and bipartite or tripartite correlations are sequentially filtered from the input invariant sets so that experiments with larger input sets are checking for true multipartite correlation. We rediscover several known relationships between polynomial, homological, and hyperbolic knot invariants, while also finding novel correlations which are not explained by known results in knot theory. These unexplained correlations strengthen previous observations concerning links between Khovanov and knot Floer homology. Our results also point to a new connection between quantum algebraic and hyperbolic invariants, similar to the generalized volume conjecture.

# Statistical Mechanics of Support Vector Regression

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05439

arXiv:2412.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key problem in deep learning and computational neuroscience is relating the geometrical properties of neural representations to task performance. Here, we consider this problem for continuous decoding tasks where neural variability may affect task precision. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we study the average-case learning curves for $\varepsilon$-insensitive Support Vector Regression ($\varepsilon$-SVR) and discuss its capacity as a measure of linear decodability. Our analysis reveals a phase transition in the training error at a critical load, capturing the interplay between the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$ and neural variability. We uncover a double-descent phenomenon in the generalization error, showing that $\varepsilon$ acts as a regularizer, both suppressing and shifting these peaks. Theoretical predictions are validated both on toy models and deep neural networks, extending the theory of Support Vector Machines to continuous tasks with inherent neural variability.

# Scalable Training of Neural Network Potentials for Complex Interfaces Through Data Augmentation

## 通过数据增强对复杂接口的神经网络潜力进行可扩展的训练

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05773

arXiv:2412.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural network (ANN) potentials enable highly accurate atomistic simulations of complex materials at unprecedented scales. Despite their promise, training ANN potentials to represent intricate potential energy surfaces (PES) with transferability to diverse chemical environments remains computationally intensive, especially when atomic force data are incorporated to improve PES gradients. Here, we present an efficient ANN potential training methodology that uses Gaussian process regression (GPR) to incorporate atomic forces into ANN training, leading to accurate PES models with fewer additional first-principles calculations and a reduced computational effort for training. Our GPR-ANN approach generates synthetic energy data from force information in the reference dataset, thus augmenting the training datasets and bypassing direct force training. Benchmark tests on hybrid density-functional theory data for ethylene carbonate (EC) molecules and Li metal-EC interfaces, relevant for lithium metal battery applications, demonstrate that GPR-ANN potentials achieve accuracies comparable to fully force-trained ANNs with a significantly reduced computational overhead. Detailed comparisons show that the method improves both data efficiency and scalability for complex interfaces and heterogeneous environments. This work establishes the GPR-ANN method as a powerful and scalable framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning interatomic potentials, offering the computational and memory efficiency critical for the large-scale simulations needed for the simulation of materials interfaces.

# Materials-Discovery Workflows Guided by Symbolic Regression: Identifying Acid-Stable Oxides for Electrocatalysis

## 符号回归指导的材料发现工作流程: 识别用于电催化的酸稳定氧化物

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05947

arXiv:2412.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of active learning (AL) approaches to identify materials with desired properties relies on the knowledge of a few parameters describing the property. However, these parameters are unknown if the property is governed by a high intricacy of many atomistic processes. Here, we develop an AL workflow based on the sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) symbolic-regression approach. SISSO identifies the few, key parameters correlated with a given materials property via analytical expressions, out of many offered primary features. Crucially, we train ensembles of SISSO models in order to quantify mean predictions and their uncertainty, enabling the use of SISSO in AL. By combining bootstrap sampling to obtain training datasets with Monte-Carlo feature dropout, the high prediction errors observed by a single SISSO model are improved. Besides, the feature dropout procedure alleviates the overconfidence issues observed in the widely used bagging approach. We demonstrate the SISSO-guided AL workflow by identifying acid-stable oxides for water splitting using high-quality DFT-HSE06 calculations. From a pool of 1470 materials, 12 acid-stable materials are identified in only 30 AL iterations. The materials property maps provided by SISSO along with the uncertainty estimates reduce the risk of missing promising portions of the materials space that were overlooked in the initial, possibly biased dataset.

Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity.

This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.

# A brief introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo method and the fixed-node approximation

## 扩散蒙特卡罗方法和固定节点近似简介

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06006

arXiv:2412.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods represent a powerful family of computational techniques for tackling complex quantum many-body problems and performing calculations of stationary state properties. QMC is among the most accurate and powerful approaches to the study of electronic structure, but its application is often hindered by a steep learning curve, hence it is rarely addressed in undergraduate and postgraduate classes. This tutorial is a step towards filling this gap. We offer an introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method, which aims to solve the imaginary time Schr\"odinger equation through stochastic sampling of the configuration space. Starting from the theoretical foundations, the discussion leads naturally to the formulation of a step-by-step algorithm. To illustrate how the method works in simplified scenarios, examples such as the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom are provided. The discussion extends to the fixed-node approximation, a crucial approach for addressing the fermionic sign problem in multi-electron systems. In particular, we examine the influence of trial wavefunction nodal surfaces on the accuracy of DMC energy by evaluating results from a non-interacting two-fermion system. Extending the method to excited states is feasible in principle, but some additional considerations are needed, supported by practical insights. By addressing the fundamental concepts from a hands-on perspective, we hope this tutorial will serve as a valuable guide for researchers and students approaching DMC for the first time.

arXiv:2412.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, alloying and thermal treatment are considered as the main tools for design of new materials. Application of first-principles simulations can significantly accelerate the process of materials design, however, to account for both, multicomponent chemical disorder and finite temperature effects in theoretical simulations is a challenging task. In this work we have trained machine learning interatomic potential to effectively simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young's modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.

# Can Neural Networks Learn Nanoscale Friction?

## 神经网络可以学习纳米级摩擦吗？

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06677

arXiv:2412.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current nanofriction experiments on crystals, both tip-on-surface and surface-on-surface, provide force traces as their sole output, typically exhibiting atomic size stick-slip oscillations. Physically interpreting these traces is a task left to the researcher. Historically done by hand, it generally consists in identifying the parameters of a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model that best reproduces these traces. This procedure is both work-intensive and quite uncertain. We explore in this work how machine learning (ML) could be harnessed to do that job with optimal results, and minimal human work. A set of synthetic force traces is produced by PT model simulations covering a large span of parameters, and a simple neural network (NN) perceptron is trained with it. Once this trained NN is fed with experimental force traces, it will ideally output the PT parameters that best approximate them. By following this route step by step, we encountered and solved a variety of problems which proved most instructive and revealing. In particular, and very importantly, we met unexpected inaccuracies with which one or another parameter was learned by the NN. The problem, we then show, could be eliminated by proper manipulations and augmentations operated on the training force traces, and that without extra efforts and without injecting experimental informations. Direct application to the sliding of a graphene coated AFM tip on a variety of 2D materials substrates validates and encourages use of this ML method as a ready tool to rationalise and interpret future stick-slip nanofriction data.

# Vision transformer based Deep Learning of Topological indicators in Majorana Nanowires

## 基于视觉转换器的Majorana纳米线拓扑指标深度学习

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06768

arXiv:2412.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1D superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are leading candidates for topological quantum computation due to their ability to host Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we utilize a Vision Transformer-based neural network to predict using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests a topological MZMs phase, and also to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to arbitrary confidence ($P>0.9998$) classify a device as possessing a non-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder parameters. Further, within these regimes we demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements alternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological indicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This work serves as a significant advance offering a step towards the practical realization of Majorana-based quantum devices, enabling a deep-learning understanding of the topological properties in disordered nanowire systems. We validate our method using extensive simulated Majorana results in the presence of disorder, and suggest using this technique for the analysis of experimental data in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Majorana platforms.

arXiv:2412.05418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a budget on total model size, one must decide whether to train a single, large neural network or to combine the predictions of many smaller networks. We study this trade-off for ensembles of random-feature ridge regression models. We prove that when a fixed number of trainable parameters are partitioned among $K$ independently trained models, $K=1$ achieves optimal performance, provided the ridge parameter is optimally tuned. We then derive scaling laws which describe how the test risk of an ensemble of regression models decays with its total size. We identify conditions on the kernel and task eigenstructure under which ensembles can achieve near-optimal scaling laws. Training ensembles of deep convolutional neural networks on CIFAR-10 and a transformer architecture on C4, we find that a single large network outperforms any ensemble of networks with the same total number of parameters, provided the weight decay and feature-learning strength are tuned to their optimal values.

# Mott Transition and Volume Law Entanglement with Neural Quantum States

Abstract: The interplay between delocalisation and repulsive interactions can cause electronic systems to undergo a Mott transition between a metal and an insulator. Here we use neural network hidden fermion determinantal states (HFDS) to uncover this transition in the disordered, fully-connected Hubbard model. Whilst dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) provides exact solutions to physical observables of the model in the thermodynamic limit, our method allows us to directly access the wave function for finite system sizes well beyond the reach of exact diagonalisation. We demonstrate how HFDS are able to obtain more accurate results in the metallic regime and in the vicinity of the transition than calculations based on a Matrix Product State (MPS) ansatz, for which the volume law of entanglement exhibited by the system is prohibitive. We use the HFDS method to calculate the energy and double occupancy, the quasi-particle weight and the energy gap and, importantly, the amplitudes of the wave function which provide a novel insight into this model. Our work paves the way for the study of strongly correlated electron systems with neural quantum states.

# Identifying percolation phase transitions with unsupervised learning based on largest clusters

arXiv:2311.14725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of machine learning in the study of phase transitions has achieved remarkable success in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. It is widely recognized that unsupervised learning can retrieve phase transition information through hidden variables. However, using unsupervised methods to identify the critical point of percolation models has remained an intriguing challenge. This paper suggests that, by inputting the largest cluster rather than the original configuration into the learning model, unsupervised learning can indeed predict the critical point of the percolation model. Furthermore, we observe that when the largest cluster configuration is randomly shuffled-altering the positions of occupied sites or bonds-there is no significant difference in the output compared to learning the largest cluster configuration directly. This finding suggests a more general principle: unsupervised learning primarily captures particle density, or more specifically, occupied site density. However, shuffling does impact the formation of the largest cluster, which is directly related to phase transitions. As randomness increases, we observe that the correlation length tends to decrease, providing direct evidence of this relationship. We also propose a method called Fake Finite Size Scaling (FFSS) to calculate the critical value, which improves the accuracy of fitting to a great extent.

# Compositional Representation of Polymorphic Crystalline Materials

arXiv:2312.13289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has seen promising developments in materials science, yet its efficacy largely depends on detailed crystal structural data, which are often complex and hard to obtain, limiting their applicability in real-world material synthesis processes. An alternative, using compositional descriptors, offers a simpler approach by indicating the elemental ratios of compounds without detailed structural insights. However, accurately representing materials solely with compositional descriptors presents challenges due to polymorphism, where a single composition can correspond to various structural arrangements, creating ambiguities in its representation. To this end, we introduce PCRL, a novel approach that employs probabilistic modeling of composition to capture the diverse polymorphs from available structural information. Extensive evaluations on sixteen datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PCRL in learning compositional representation, and our analysis highlights its potential applicability of PCRL in material discovery. The source code for PCRL is available at https://github.com/Namkyeong/PCRL.

arXiv:2404.17365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.

Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines are used for probabilistic learning and are capable of capturing complex dependencies in data. They are employed for diverse purposes such as dimensionality reduction, feature learning and can be used for representing and analyzing physical systems with minimal data. In this paper, we investigate a complex, strongly correlated magnetic spin system with multiple metastable states (magnetic artificial spin ice) using a restricted Boltzmann machine. Magnetic artificial spin ice is of interest because degeneracies can be specified leading to complex states that support unusual collective dynamics. We investigate two distinct geometries exhibiting different low-temperature orderings to evaluate the machine's performance and adaptability in capturing diverse magnetic behaviors. Data sets constructed with spin configurations importance-sampled from the partition function of square and pinwheel artificial spin ice Hamiltonians at different temperatures are used to extract features of distributions using a restricted Boltzmann machine. Results indicate that the restricted Boltzmann machine algorithm is sensitive to features that define the artificial spin ice configuration space and is able to reproduce the thermodynamic quantities of the system away from criticality - a feature useful for faster sample generation. Additionally, we demonstrate how the restricted Boltzmann machine can distinguish between different artificial spin ice geometries in data even when structural defects are present.

Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.

# Dissecting the Interplay of Attention Paths in a Statistical Mechanics Theory of Transformers

arXiv:2405.15926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable empirical performance of Transformers, their theoretical understanding remains elusive. Here, we consider a deep multi-head self-attention network, that is closely related to Transformers yet analytically tractable. We develop a statistical mechanics theory of Bayesian learning in this model, deriving exact equations for the network's predictor statistics under the finite-width thermodynamic limit, i.e., $N,P\rightarrow\infty$, $P/N=\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $N$ is the network width and $P$ is the number of training examples. Our theory shows that the predictor statistics are expressed as a sum of independent kernels, each one pairing different 'attention paths', defined as information pathways through different attention heads across layers. The kernels are weighted according to a 'task-relevant kernel combination' mechanism that aligns the total kernel with the task labels. As a consequence, this interplay between attention paths enhances generalization performance. Experiments confirm our findings on both synthetic and real-world sequence classification tasks. Finally, our theory explicitly relates the kernel combination mechanism to properties of the learned weights, allowing for a qualitative transfer of its insights to models trained via gradient descent. As an illustration, we demonstrate an efficient size reduction of the network, by pruning those attention heads that are deemed less relevant by our theory.

Abstract: Understanding the learning process and the embedded computation in transformers is becoming a central goal for the development of interpretable AI. In the present study, we introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for generative models of sequences on trees, allowing us to hand-tune the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformers can approximate the exact inference algorithm when trained on root classification and masked language modeling tasks, and study how this computation is discovered and implemented. We find that correlations at larger distances, corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy, are sequentially included by the network during training. Moreover, by comparing attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering and by probing the different encoder levels, we find clear evidence of a reconstruction of correlations on successive length scales corresponding to the various levels of the hierarchy, which we relate to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm within the same architecture.

arXiv:2410.17942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.

Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting is crucial in different areas ranging from science to decision making. Recent advancements in data-driven models have shown significant promise, particularly in weather forecasting community, but yet no data-driven approaches have matched the accuracy and the scalability of traditional global ocean forecasting systems that rely on physics-driven numerical models and can be very computationally expensive, depending on their spatial resolution or complexity. Here, we introduce GLONET, a global ocean neural network-based forecasting system, developed by Mercator Ocean International. GLONET is trained on the global Mercator Ocean physical reanalysis GLORYS12 to integrate physics-based principles through neural operators and networks, which dynamically capture local-global interactions within a unified, scalable framework, ensuring high small-scale accuracy and efficient dynamics. GLONET's performance is assessed and benchmarked against two other forecasting systems: the global Mercator Ocean analysis and forecasting 1/12 high-resolution physical system GLO12 and a recent neural-based system also trained from GLORYS12. A series of comprehensive validation metrics is proposed, specifically tailored for neural network-based ocean forecasting systems, which extend beyond traditional point-wise error assessments that can introduce bias towards neural networks optimized primarily to minimize such metrics. The preliminary evaluation of GLONET shows promising results, for temperature, sea surface height, salinity and ocean currents. GLONET's experimental daily forecast are accessible through the European Digital Twin Ocean platform EDITO.

# A Variational Computational-based Framework for Unsteady Incompressible Flows

## 基于变分计算的非定常不可压缩流框架

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05525

arXiv:2412.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in computational fluid mechanics have largely relied on Newtonian frameworks, particularly through the direct simulation of Navier-Stokes equations. In this work, we propose an alternative computational framework that employs variational methods, specifically by leveraging the principle of minimum pressure gradient, which turns the fluid mechanics problem into a minimization problem whose solution can be used to predict the flow field in unsteady incompressible viscous flows.
  This method exhibits two particulary intriguing properties. First, it circumvents the chronic issues of pressure-velocity coupling in incompressible flows, which often dominates the computational cost in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Second, this method eliminates the reliance on unphysical assumptions at the outflow boundary, addressing another longstanding challenge in CFD.
  We apply this framework to three benchmark examples across a range of Reynolds numbers: (i) unsteady flow field in a lid-driven cavity, (ii) Poiseuille flow, and (iii) flow past a circular cylinder. The minimization framework is carried out using a physics-informed neural network (PINN), which integrates the underlying physical principles directly into the training of the model. The results from the proposed method are validated against high-fidelity CFD simulations, showing an excellent agreement. Comparison of the proposed variational method to the conventional method, wherein PINNs is directly applied to solve Navier-Stokes Equations, reveals that the proposed method outperforms conventional PINNs in terms of both convergence rate and time, demonstrating its potential for solving complex fluid mechanics problems.

# Leveraging Time-Series Foundation Model for Subsurface Well Logs Prediction and Anomaly Detection

## 利用时间序列基础模型进行地下测井预测和异常检测

arXiv:2412.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise in energy demand highlights the importance of suitable subsurface storage, requiring detailed and accurate subsurface characterization often reliant on high-quality borehole well log data. However, obtaining complete well-log data is costly and time-consuming, with missing data being common due to borehole conditions or tool errors. While machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented to address these issues, they often fail to capture the intricate, nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies in complex well log sequences. Additionally, prior AI-driven models typically require retraining when introduced to new datasets and are constrained to deployment in the same basin.
  In this study, we explored and evaluated the potential of a time-series foundation model leveraging transformer architecture and a generative pre-trained approach for predicting and detecting anomalies in borehole well log data. Specifically, we fine-tuned and adopted the TimeGPT architecture to forecast key log responses and detect anomalies with high accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving R2 of up to 87% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.95%. Additionally, the model's zero-shot capability successfully identified subtle yet critical anomalies, such as drilling hazards or unexpected geological formations, with an overall accuracy of 93%.
  The model represents a significant advancement in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling zero-shot inference through fine-tuning. Its application in well-log prediction enhances operational decision-making while reducing risks associated with subsurface exploration. These findings demonstrate the model's potential to transform well-log data analysis, particularly in complex geological settings.

arXiv:2412.05714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a hybrid approach that combines the Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) with deep learning techniques to provide real-time solutions for parametrised mechanics problems. By relying on a tensor decomposition, the proposed method addresses the curse of dimensionality in parametric computations, enabling efficient handling of high-dimensional problems across multiple physics and configurations. Each mode in the tensor decomposition is generated by a sparse neural network within the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework presented in Part I, where network parameters are constrained to replicate the classical shape functions used in the Finite Element Method. This constraint enhances the interpretability of the model, facilitating transfer learning, which improves significantly the robustness and cost of the training process. The FENNI framework also enables finding the optimal spatial and parametric discretisation dynamically during training, which accounts to optimising the model's architecture on the fly. This hybrid framework offers a flexible and interpretable solution for real-time surrogate modelling. We highlight the efficiency of the FENNI-PGD approach through 1D and 2D benchmark problems, validating its performance against analytical and numerical reference solutions. The framework is illustrated through linear and non-linear elasticity problems, showing the flexibility of the method in terms of changes in physics.

## 高保真神经网络电位的内隐Delta学习

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06064

arXiv:2412.06064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a fast and accurate alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations but are hindered by the high cost of training data from high-fidelity Quantum Mechanics (QM) methods. Our work introduces the Implicit Delta Learning (IDLe) method, which reduces the need for high-fidelity QM data by leveraging cheaper semi-empirical QM computations without compromising NNP accuracy or inference cost. IDLe employs an end-to-end multi-task architecture with fidelity-specific heads that decode energies based on a shared latent representation of the input atomistic system. In various settings, IDLe achieves the same accuracy as single high-fidelity baselines while using up to 50x less high-fidelity data. This result could significantly reduce data generation cost and consequently enhance accuracy and generalization, and expand chemical coverage for NNPs, advancing MD simulations for material science and drug discovery. Additionally, we provide a novel set of 11 million semi-empirical QM calculations to support future multi-fidelity NNP modeling.

# Unidirectional focusing of light using structured diffractive surfaces

## 使用结构化衍射表面对光的单向聚焦

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06221

arXiv:2412.06221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unidirectional optical systems enable selective control of light through asymmetric processing of radiation, effectively transmitting light in one direction while blocking unwanted propagation in the opposite direction. Here, we introduce a reciprocal diffractive unidirectional focusing design based on linear and isotropic diffractive layers that are structured. Using deep learning-based optimization, a cascaded set of diffractive layers are spatially engineered at the wavelength scale to focus light efficiently in the forward direction while blocking it in the opposite direction. The forward energy focusing efficiency and the backward energy suppression capabilities of this unidirectional architecture were demonstrated under various illumination angles and wavelengths, illustrating the versatility of our polarization-insensitive design. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these designs are resilient to adversarial attacks that utilize wavefront engineering from outside. Experimental validation using terahertz radiation confirmed the feasibility of this diffractive unidirectional focusing framework. Diffractive unidirectional designs can operate across different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum by scaling the resulting diffractive features proportional to the wavelength of light and will find applications in security, defense, and optical communication, among others.

# Online learning in idealized ocean gyres

## 理想化海洋环流中的在线学习

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06393

arXiv:2412.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean turbulence parameterization has principally been based on processed-based approaches, seeking to embed physical principles so that coarser resolution calculations can capture the net influence of smaller scale unresolved processes. More recently there has been an increasing focus on the application of data-driven approaches to this problem. Here we consider the application of online learning to data-driven eddy parameterization, constructing an end-to-end differentiable dynamical solver forced by a neural network, and training the neural network based on the dynamics of the combined hybrid system. This approach is applied to the classic barotropic Stommel-Munk gyre problem -- a highly idealized configuration which nevertheless includes multiple flow regimes, boundary dynamics, and a separating jet, and therefore presents a challenging test case for the online learning approach. It is found that a suitable network architecture which is suitably trained can lead to a coarse resolution neural network parameterized model which is stable, and has both a reasonable mean state and intrinsic variability. This suggests that online learning is a powerful tool for studying the problem of ocean turbulence parameterization.

Abstract: The mapping of ocean floor layers is a current challenge for the oil industry. Existing solution methods involve mapping through seismic methods and wave inversion, which are complex and computationally expensive. The introduction of artificial neural networks, specifically UNet, to predict velocity models based on seismic shots reflected from the ocean floor shows promise for optimising this process. In this study, two neural network architectures are validated for velocity model inversion and compared in terms of stability metrics such as loss function and similarity coefficient, as well as the differences between predicted and actual models. Indeed, neural networks prove promising as a solution to this challenge, achieving S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient values above 70%.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBL) is one of the deadliest brain cancers in adults. The GBL cells invade the physical structures within the brain extracellular environment with patient-specific features. In this work, we propose a proof-of-concept for mathematical framework of precision oncology enabling rapid parameter estimation from neuroimaging data in clinical settings.
  The proposed diffuse interface model of GBL growth is informed by neuroimaging data, periodically collected in a clinical study from diagnosis to surgery and adjuvant treatment. We build a robust and efficient computational pipeline to aid clinical decision-making based on integrating model reduction techniques and neural networks. Patient specificity is captured through the segmentation of the magnetic resonance imaging into a computational replica of the patient brain, mimicking the brain microstructure by incorporating also the diffusion tensor imaging data.
  The full order model (FOM) is first discretized using the finite element method and later approximated by a reduced order model (ROM) adopting proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Trained by clinical data, we finally use neural networks to map the parameter space of GBL evolution over time and to predict the patient-specific model parameters from the observed clinical evolution of the tumor mass.

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05333

arXiv:2412.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high energy physics, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have the potential to aid in the creation of machine learning models without the need for labeled datasets for a variety of tasks, including those related to jets -- narrow sprays of particles produced by quarks and gluons in high energy particle collisions. This study introduces an approach to learning jet representations without hand-crafted augmentations using a jet-based joint embedding predictive architecture (J-JEPA), which aims to predict various physical targets from an informative context. As our method does not require hand-crafted augmentation like other common SSL techniques, J-JEPA avoids introducing biases that could harm downstream tasks. Since different tasks generally require invariance under different augmentations, this training without hand-crafted augmentation enables versatile applications, offering a pathway toward a cross-task foundation model. We finetune the representations learned by J-JEPA for jet tagging and benchmark them against task-specific representations.

# Knowledge-Based Deep Learning for Time-Efficient Inverse Dynamics

## 基于知识的时间有效逆动力学深度学习

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05403

arXiv:2412.05403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate understanding of muscle activation and muscle forces plays an essential role in neuro-rehabilitation and musculoskeletal disorder treatments. Computational musculoskeletal modeling has been widely used as a powerful non-invasive tool to estimate them through inverse dynamics using static optimization, but the inherent computational complexity results in time-consuming analysis. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based deep learning framework for time-efficient inverse dynamic analysis, which can predict muscle activation and muscle forces from joint kinematic data directly while not requiring any label information during model training. The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network is selected as the backbone of our model due to its proficient handling of time-series data. Prior physical knowledge from forward dynamics and pre-selected inverse dynamics based physiological criteria are integrated into the loss function to guide the training of neural networks. Experimental validations on two datasets, including one benchmark upper limb movement dataset and one self-collected lower limb movement dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed. The experimental results have shown that the selected BiGRU architecture outperforms other neural network models when trained using our specifically designed loss function, which illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions within scientific machine learning models by introducing innovative temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. By integrating the Adams-Bashforth scheme with adaptive multi-step strategies, our graph neural network-based auto-regressive model accurately predicts 350 future time steps, even under practical constraints such as limited training data and minimal model capacity -- achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions, effectively mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering discipline.

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05719

arXiv:2412.05719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework, a sparse neural network architecture extending previous work on Embedded Finite Element Neural Networks (EFENN) introduced with the Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Networks (HiDeNN). Due to their mesh-based structure, EFENN requires significantly fewer trainable parameters than fully connected neural networks, with individual weights and biases having a clear interpretation.
  Our FENNI framework, within the EFENN framework, brings improvements to the HiDeNN approach. First, we propose a reference element-based architecture where shape functions are defined on a reference element, enabling variability in interpolation functions and straightforward use of Gaussian quadrature rules for evaluating the loss function. Second, we propose a pragmatic multigrid training strategy based on the framework's interpretability. Third, HiDeNN's combined rh-adaptivity is extended from 1D to 2D, with a new Jacobian-based criterion for adding nodes combining h- and r-adaptivity. From a deep learning perspective, adaptive mesh behavior through rh-adaptivity and the multigrid approach correspond to transfer learning, enabling FENNI to optimize the network's architecture dynamically during training.
  The framework's capabilities are demonstrated on 1D and 2D test cases, where its accuracy and computational cost are compared against an analytical solution and a classical FEM solver. On these cases, the multigrid training strategy drastically improves the training stage's efficiency and robustness. Finally, we introduce a variational loss within the EFENN framework, showing that it performs as well as energy-based losses and outperforms residual-based losses. This framework is extended to surrogate modeling over the parametric space in Part II.

# Scalable Training of Neural Network Potentials for Complex Interfaces Through Data Augmentation

## 通过数据增强对复杂接口的神经网络潜力进行可扩展的训练

arXiv:2412.05773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural network (ANN) potentials enable highly accurate atomistic simulations of complex materials at unprecedented scales. Despite their promise, training ANN potentials to represent intricate potential energy surfaces (PES) with transferability to diverse chemical environments remains computationally intensive, especially when atomic force data are incorporated to improve PES gradients. Here, we present an efficient ANN potential training methodology that uses Gaussian process regression (GPR) to incorporate atomic forces into ANN training, leading to accurate PES models with fewer additional first-principles calculations and a reduced computational effort for training. Our GPR-ANN approach generates synthetic energy data from force information in the reference dataset, thus augmenting the training datasets and bypassing direct force training. Benchmark tests on hybrid density-functional theory data for ethylene carbonate (EC) molecules and Li metal-EC interfaces, relevant for lithium metal battery applications, demonstrate that GPR-ANN potentials achieve accuracies comparable to fully force-trained ANNs with a significantly reduced computational overhead. Detailed comparisons show that the method improves both data efficiency and scalability for complex interfaces and heterogeneous environments. This work establishes the GPR-ANN method as a powerful and scalable framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning interatomic potentials, offering the computational and memory efficiency critical for the large-scale simulations needed for the simulation of materials interfaces.

Abstract: Identification of hadronic jets originating from heavy-flavor quarks is extremely important to several physics analyses in High Energy Physics, such as studies of the properties of the top quark and the Higgs boson, and searches for new physics. Recent algorithms used in the CMS experiment were developed using state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to distinguish jets emerging from the decay of heavy flavour (charm and bottom) quarks from those arising from light-flavor (udsg) ones. Increasingly complex deep neural network architectures, such as graphs and transformers, have helped achieve unprecedented accuracies in jet tagging. New advances in tagging algorithms, along with new calibration methods using flavour-enriched selections of proton-proton collision events, allow us to estimate flavour tagging performances with the CMS detector during early Run 3 of the LHC.

# A brief introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo method and the fixed-node approximation

arXiv:2412.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods represent a powerful family of computational techniques for tackling complex quantum many-body problems and performing calculations of stationary state properties. QMC is among the most accurate and powerful approaches to the study of electronic structure, but its application is often hindered by a steep learning curve, hence it is rarely addressed in undergraduate and postgraduate classes. This tutorial is a step towards filling this gap. We offer an introduction to the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method, which aims to solve the imaginary time Schr\"odinger equation through stochastic sampling of the configuration space. Starting from the theoretical foundations, the discussion leads naturally to the formulation of a step-by-step algorithm. To illustrate how the method works in simplified scenarios, examples such as the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom are provided. The discussion extends to the fixed-node approximation, a crucial approach for addressing the fermionic sign problem in multi-electron systems. In particular, we examine the influence of trial wavefunction nodal surfaces on the accuracy of DMC energy by evaluating results from a non-interacting two-fermion system. Extending the method to excited states is feasible in principle, but some additional considerations are needed, supported by practical insights. By addressing the fundamental concepts from a hands-on perspective, we hope this tutorial will serve as a valuable guide for researchers and students approaching DMC for the first time.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the neural tangent kernel (NTK) for general partial differential equations (PDEs) based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). As we all know, the training of an artificial neural network can be converted to the evolution of NTK. We analyze the initialization of NTK and the convergence conditions of NTK during training for general PDEs. The theoretical results show that the homogeneity of differential operators plays a crucial role for the convergence of NTK. Moreover, based on the PINNs, we validate the convergence conditions of NTK using the initial value problems of the sine-Gordon equation and the initial-boundary value problem of the KdV equation.

Abstract: Traditionally, alloying and thermal treatment are considered as the main tools for design of new materials. Application of first-principles simulations can significantly accelerate the process of materials design, however, to account for both, multicomponent chemical disorder and finite temperature effects in theoretical simulations is a challenging task. In this work we have trained machine learning interatomic potential to effectively simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young's modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been extensively applied to model the time-evolution in fluid dynamics, weather predictions, and even chaotic systems thanks to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in data. Here we present a RNN model based on convolutional neural networks for modeling the nonlinear non-adiabatic dynamics of hybrid quantum-classical systems. The dynamical evolution of the hybrid systems is governed by equations of motion for classical degrees of freedom and von Neumann equation for electrons. The physics-aware recurrent convolutional (PARC) neural network structure incorporates a differentiator-integrator architecture that inductively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of generic physical systems. Validation studies show that the trained PARC model could reproduce the space-time evolution of a one-dimensional semi-classical Holstein model {with comparable accuracy to direct numerical simulations}. We also investigate the scaling of prediction errors with size of training dataset, prediction window, step-size, and model size.

# Can Neural Networks Learn Nanoscale Friction?

arXiv:2412.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current nanofriction experiments on crystals, both tip-on-surface and surface-on-surface, provide force traces as their sole output, typically exhibiting atomic size stick-slip oscillations. Physically interpreting these traces is a task left to the researcher. Historically done by hand, it generally consists in identifying the parameters of a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model that best reproduces these traces. This procedure is both work-intensive and quite uncertain. We explore in this work how machine learning (ML) could be harnessed to do that job with optimal results, and minimal human work. A set of synthetic force traces is produced by PT model simulations covering a large span of parameters, and a simple neural network (NN) perceptron is trained with it. Once this trained NN is fed with experimental force traces, it will ideally output the PT parameters that best approximate them. By following this route step by step, we encountered and solved a variety of problems which proved most instructive and revealing. In particular, and very importantly, we met unexpected inaccuracies with which one or another parameter was learned by the NN. The problem, we then show, could be eliminated by proper manipulations and augmentations operated on the training force traces, and that without extra efforts and without injecting experimental informations. Direct application to the sliding of a graphene coated AFM tip on a variety of 2D materials substrates validates and encourages use of this ML method as a ready tool to rationalise and interpret future stick-slip nanofriction data.

Abstract: Long-term stability and physical consistency are critical properties for AI-based weather models if they are going to be used for subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasts or beyond, e.g., climate change projection. However, current AI-based weather models can only provide short-term forecasts accurately since they become unstable or physically inconsistent when time-integrated beyond a few weeks or a few months. Either they exhibit numerical blow-up or hallucinate unrealistic dynamics of the atmospheric variables, akin to the current class of autoregressive large language models. The cause of the instabilities is unknown, and the methods that are used to improve their stability horizons are ad-hoc and lack rigorous theory. In this paper, we reveal that the universal causal mechanism for these instabilities in any turbulent flow is due to \textit{spectral bias} wherein, \textit{any} deep learning architecture is biased to learn only the large-scale dynamics and ignores the small scales completely. We further elucidate how turbulence physics and the absence of convergence in deep learning-based time-integrators amplify this bias, leading to unstable error propagation. Finally, using the quasi-geostrophic flow and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data as test cases, we bridge the gap between deep learning theory and numerical analysis to propose one mitigative solution to such unphysical behavior. We develop long-term physically-consistent data-driven models for the climate system and demonstrate accurate short-term forecasts, and hundreds of years of time-integration with accurate mean and variability.

Abstract: The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.

Abstract: The Burgers hierarchy consists of nonlinear evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) with progressively higher-order dispersive and nonlinear terms. Notable members of this hierarchy are the Burgers equation and the Sharma-Tasso-Olver equation, which are widely applied in fields such as plasma physics, fluid mechanics, optics, and biophysics to describe nonlinear waves in inhomogeneous media. Various soliton and multi-soliton solutions to these equations have been identified and the fission and fusion of solitons have been studied using analytical and numerical techniques. Recently, deep learning methods, particularly Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have emerged as a new approach for solving PDEs. These methods use deep neural networks to minimize PDE residuals while fitting relevant data. Although PINNs have been applied to equations like Burgers' and Korteweg-de Vries, higher-order members of the Burgers hierarchy remain unexplored in this context. In this study, we employ a PINN algorithm to approximate multi-soliton solutions of linear combinations of equations within the Burgers hierarchy. This semi-supervised approach encodes the PDE and relevant data, determining PDE parameters and resolving the linear combination to discover the PDE that describes the data. Additionally, we employ gradient-enhanced PINNs (gPINNs) and a conservation law, specific to the generic Burgers' hierarchy, to improve training accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in describing multi-soliton solutions within the generic Burgers' hierarchy, their robustness to increased levels of data noise, and their limited yet measurable predictive capabilities. They also verify the potential for training refinement and accuracy improvement using enhanced approaches in certain cases, while enabling the discovery of the PDE model that describes the observed solitary structures.

Abstract: Charged particle dynamics under the influence of electromagnetic fields is a challenging spatiotemporal problem. Many high performance physics-based simulators for predicting behavior in a charged particle beam are computationally expensive, limiting their utility for solving inverse problems online. The problem of estimating upstream six-dimensional phase space given downstream measurements of charged particles in an accelerator is an inverse problem of growing importance. This paper introduces a reverse Latent Evolution Model (rLEM) designed for temporal inversion of forward beam dynamics. In this two-step self-supervised deep learning framework, we utilize a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to project 6D phase space projections of a charged particle beam into a lower-dimensional latent distribution. Subsequently, we autoregressively learn the inverse temporal dynamics in the latent space using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The coupled CVAE-LSTM framework can predict 6D phase space projections across all upstream accelerating sections based on single or multiple downstream phase space measurements as inputs. The proposed model also captures the aleatoric uncertainty of the high-dimensional input data within the latent space. This uncertainty, which reflects potential uncertain measurements at a given module, is propagated through the LSTM to estimate uncertainty bounds for all upstream predictions, demonstrating the robustness of the LSTM against in-distribution variations in the input data.

Abstract: We introduce the alchemical harmonic approximation (AHA) of the absolute electronic energy for charge-neutral iso-electronic diatomics at fixed interatomic distance $d_0$. To account for variations in distance, we combine AHA with this Ansatz for the electronic binding potential, $E(d)=(E_{u}-E_s) \left(\frac{E_c-E_s}{E_u-E_s}\right)^{\sqrt{d/d_0}}+E_s$, where $E_u,E_c,E_s$ correspond to the energies of united atom, calibration at $d_0$, and sum of infinitely separated atoms, respectively. Our model covers the entire two-dimensional electronic potential energy surface spanned by distance and difference in nuclear charge from which only one single point (with elements of nuclear charge $Z_1,Z_2$ and distance $d_0$) is drawn to calibrate $E_c$. Using reference data from pbe0/cc-pVDZ, we present numerical evidence for the electronic ground-state of all neutral diatomics with 8, 10, 12, 14 electrons. We assess the validity of our model by comparison to legacy interatomic potentials (Harmonic oscillator, Lennard-Jones, and Morse) within the most relevant range of binding (0.7 - 2.5 A), and find comparable accuracy if restricted to single diatomics, and significantly better predictive power when extrapolating to the entire iso-electronic series. We also investigated $\Delta$-learning of the electronic absolute energy using our model as baseline. This baseline model results in a systematic improvement, effectively reducing training data needs for reaching chemical accuracy by up to an order of magnitude from $\sim$1000 to $\sim$100. By contrast, using AHA+Morse as a baseline hardly leads to any improvement, and sometimes even deteriorates the predictive power. Inferring the energy of unseen CO converges to a prediction error of $\sim$0.1 Ha in direct learning, and $\sim$0.04 Ha with our baseline.

Abstract: This study leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to train synthetic jet-based flow control strategies for circular and square cylinders. The central aim is to ascertain the optimal jet placements that strike an ideal balance between energy efficiency and control effectiveness, by formulating a cohesive strategy based on a comprehensive analysis of flow control performance and energy consumption across a range of configurations. First, the results from single-action training indicate that for circle cylinder, positioning the synthetic jet approximately 105{\deg} from the stagnation point achieves the most energy-efficient and effective control strategy. For square cylinder, placing the jet near the rear corner addresses the dual objectives of minimizing energy consumption and maximizing control performance. Second, compared to single-action control, multi-action control exhibits reduced convergence speed and stability. However, simultaneously activating synthetic jets at multiple locations significantly decreases initial energy consumption and enhances energy efficiency. The findings underscore the critical importance of accurately positioning the synthetic jet at the primary flow separation point, as this alignment not only enhances flow control performance but also establishes an optimal balance between energy efficiency and control effectiveness within the flow system. Furthermore, the interaction between synthetic jets and the flow system alters surface streamline patterns and local flow structures, resulting in effects that are considerably larger in scale than the jets themselves. This study crystallizes the potential of DRL algorithms to intelligently optimize intricate flow control strategies, effectively balancing energy efficiency with enhanced flow control performance through strategically optimized jet placement.

Using exemplified mode conversion systems, we show how various physical transformation rules within diffractive networks can be unveiled given properly defined input/output mode relations. Surprising physical transformation division phenomenon and an optical analogy of gradientvanishing-effect have been observed and discussed for high-dimensional mode sorting tasks. The use of physical interpretation for efficiently designing a parameter-varying network has also been demonstrated. These physically interpretable optical networks resolve the contradiction between rigorous physical theorem and operationally vague network structure, and pave the way for further interpret advanced deep learning tasks and other physical neural networks.

arXiv:2206.05183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop data-driven methods incorporating geometric and topological information to learn parsimonious representations of nonlinear dynamics from observations. The approaches learn nonlinear state-space models of the dynamics for general manifold latent spaces using training strategies related to Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Our methods are referred to as Geometric Dynamic (GD) Variational Autoencoders (GD-VAEs). We learn encoders and decoders for the system states and evolution based on deep neural network architectures that include general Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and other architectures. Motivated by problems arising in parameterized PDEs and physics, we investigate the performance of our methods on tasks for learning reduced dimensional representations of the nonlinear Burgers Equations, Constrained Mechanical Systems, and spatial fields of Reaction-Diffusion Systems. GD-VAEs provide methods that can be used to obtain representations in manifold latent spaces for diverse learning tasks involving dynamics.

# EquiJump: Protein Dynamics Simulation via SO(3)-Equivariant Stochastic Interpolants

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09667

arXiv:2410.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mapping the conformational dynamics of proteins is crucial for elucidating their functional mechanisms. While Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation enables detailed time evolution of protein motion, its computational toll hinders its use in practice. To address this challenge, multiple deep learning models for reproducing and accelerating MD have been proposed drawing on transport-based generative methods. However, existing work focuses on generation through transport of samples from prior distributions, that can often be distant from the data manifold. The recently proposed framework of stochastic interpolants, instead, enables transport between arbitrary distribution endpoints. Building upon this work, we introduce EquiJump, a transferable SO(3)-equivariant model that bridges all-atom protein dynamics simulation time steps directly. Our approach unifies diverse sampling methods and is benchmarked against existing models on trajectory data of fast folding proteins. EquiJump achieves state-of-the-art results on dynamics simulation with a transferable model on all of the fast folding proteins.

# Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data

## 从实验数据中学习马尔可夫开放量子系统的动力学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17942

arXiv:2410.17942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.

# WeatherGFM: Learning A Weather Generalist Foundation Model via In-context Learning

## WeatherGFM: 通过上下文学习学习天气多面手基础模型

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05420

arXiv:2411.05420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Earth's weather system encompasses intricate weather data modalities and diverse weather understanding tasks, which hold significant value to human life. Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). Although these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound. In response to these limitations, we draw inspiration from the in-context learning paradigm employed in state-of-the-art visual foundation models and large language models. In this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather foundation model (WeatherGFM), designed to address a wide spectrum of weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. More specifically, we initially unify the representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks. Subsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather data modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks.

# Enhancing creep resistance in refractory high-entropy alloys: role of grain size and local chemical order

## 提高耐火高熵合金的抗蠕变性: 晶粒尺寸和局部化学顺序的作用

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00588

arXiv:2412.00588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.

# Interpreting Transformers for Jet Tagging

## 解释用于Jet标记的变压器

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03673

arXiv:2412.03673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms, particularly attention-based transformer models, have become indispensable for analyzing the vast data generated by particle physics experiments like ATLAS and CMS at the CERN LHC. Particle Transformer (ParT), a state-of-the-art model, leverages particle-level attention to improve jet-tagging tasks, which are critical for identifying particles resulting from proton collisions. This study focuses on interpreting ParT by analyzing attention heat maps and particle-pair correlations on the $\eta$-$\phi$ plane, revealing a binary attention pattern where each particle attends to at most one other particle. At the same time, we observe that ParT shows varying focus on important particles and subjets depending on decay, indicating that the model learns traditional jet substructure observables. These insights enhance our understanding of the model's internal workings and learning process, offering potential avenues for improving the efficiency of transformer architectures in future high-energy physics applications.

# A Machine-Learned "Chemical Intuition" to Overcome Spectroscopic Data Scarcity

## 克服光谱数据稀缺的机器学习 “化学直觉”

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rzqmh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Machine learning models for predicting IR spectra of molecular ions (infrared ion spectroscopy, IRIS) have yet to be reported owing to the relatively sparse experimental datasets available. To overcome this limitation, we employ the Graphormer-IR model for neutral molecules as a knowledgeable starting point, then employ transfer learning to refine the model to predict the spectra of gaseous ions. A library of 10,336 computed spectra and a small dataset of 312 experimental IRIS spectra is used for model fine-tuning. Nonspecific global graph encodings that describe the molecular charge state (i.e., (de)protonation, sodiation), combined with an additional transfer learning step that considers computed spectra for ions, improved model performance. The resulting Graphormer-IRIS model yields spectra that are 21% more accurate than those produced by commonly employed DFT quantum chemical models, while capturing subtle phenomena such as spectral red-shifts due to sodiation. Dimensionality reduction of model embeddings demonstrate derived “chemical intuition” of functional groups, trends in molecular electron density, and the location of charge sites.  Our approach will enable fast IRIS predictions for determining the structures of unknown small molecule analytes (e.g., metabolites, lipids) present in biological samples.

# Autoparty: Machine Learning-Guided Visual Inspection of Molecular Docking Results

## Autoparty: 机器学习引导的分子对接结果可视化检测

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-7p4ws?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Human inspection of potential drug compounds is crucial in the virtual drug screening pipeline. However, there is a pressing need to accelerate this process, as the number of molecules humans can realistically examine is extremely limited relative to the scale of virtual screens. Furthermore, computational medicinal chemists can evaluate different poses inconsistently, and there is no standard way of recording annotations. We propose Autoparty, a containerized tool to address these challenges. Autoparty leverages on-premises active learning for drug discovery to facilitate human-in-the-loop training of models that extrapolate human intuition. We leverage multiple uncertainty quantification metrics to query the user with informative examples for model training, limiting the number of human expert training labels. The collected annotations populate a persistent and exportable local database for broad downstream uses. Incorporating Autoparty doubled the hit rate among 193 experimentally tested compounds in a real-world case study.

# Automated Structure Analysis of Small Angle Scattering Data via Machine Learning

## 基于机器学习的小角度散射数据自动结构分析

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-ggnch?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Billions of dollars have been invested in recent years to build up national scattering facilities around the world with more advanced configurations and faster data collection for small angle scattering (SAS), a technique that enables in-situ structural analysis of nanoparticles (NP) under stringent sample environments. However, the interpretation of experimental SAS data collected in reciprocal space to determine its corresponding real-space morphology is typically a slow process that requires significant domain expertise, leading to high-throughput scattering facilities such as synchrotron scattering centers collecting large quantities of data that may potentially be left unanalyzed. Here, we report a fast and data-efficient machine learning (ML) framework for identifying NP morphologies and their corresponding structural parameters from both theoretical and experimental SAS data. The developed classification and regression models, which take as input raw scattering curves with minimal pre-processing, are able to accurately identify the morphology and structural dimensions from experimental scattering curves with comparable accuracy to human experts. Critically, we discuss design choices that facilitate the practical application of ML frameworks in scattering facilities. Our ML framework is designed to be easy to train, to work well when extrapolating to structural parameters outside of the parameter range the models were trained on, and to enable verification of ML predictions. The enhanced data analysis efficiency enabled by application of these ML models to real-time in-situ analysis of SAS data has the potential to revolutionize the utilization of synchrotron and neutron scattering facilities for probing nanostructures.

# Including physics-informed atomization constraints in neural networks for reactive chemistry

## 在用于反应化学的神经网络中包括物理通知的雾化约束

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-lsp3k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools for investigating atomistic systems with high accuracy and relatively low computational cost. However, a common challenge with current MLIPs is their limited ability to accurately predict the relative energies of systems containing isolated or nearly isolated atoms, which often appear in various chemical processes. To address this limitation, we present a technique for modifying existing neural network architectures in a minimal way which accounts for the energies of isolated atoms and the atomization energy (AE) of a system. Using this technique, we build a model architecture we call HIP-NN-AE, an enhanced version of the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network (HIP-NN). Our results demonstrate that the HIP-NN-AE model significantly outperforms the previous HIP-NN model in multiple scenarios involving isolated atoms, such as complete atomization and bond dissociation processes. We also show that this innovation does not compromise the model performance on other tasks, including barrier height and conformational energy variation. The HIP-NN-AE model thus offers a robust solution to the challenges posed by isolated atoms in energy prediction tasks.

Background Breast cancer remains the most frequent cancer diagnosed in females, resulting in high mortality rates worldwide. Approximately 2.3&amp;nbsp;million cases are diagnosed annually. If it is detected at an early stage, the rate of survival is significantly improved; therefore, there is an urgent need for techniques that can be used for its effective diagnosis.Method The study aimed to present a hybrid model for breast cancer classification by employing DenseNet201 as a feature extractor and Bayesian-Optimized Fast Learning Network (FLN) as a classifier. The pre-trained DenseNet201 extracts high-quality features from breast ultrasound images on large datasets, which get classified through an FLN optimized using Bayesian techniques for hyperparameter tuning.Results The model performed well by achieving an accuracy of 96.79%, 94.71% F1 score, 96.81% precision, and 93.48% recall, while the AUC for benign, malignant, and normal cases was found to be 0.96, 0.95, and 0.98, respectively. Cross-entropy loss metrics further validated the model on its robust training and validation.Conclusion There is a great potential that this proposed model could enhance breast cancer diagnosis. This indeed is a reliable and efficient clinical solution for application.

# Quantitative Measurement of Iris Melanin Content by Polarization-Sensitive Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomograph

## 偏振敏感眼前节光学相干断层扫描仪定量测量虹膜黑色素含量

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5379311/latest

Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate iris melanin content utilizing polarization-sensitive anterior segment optical coherence tomography (PS-AS-OCT) and explore its correlation with iris color in brown-eye individuals.
Methods: Iris cross-sections were imaged using PS-AS-OCT and the iris substructural layers were automatically segmented by the deep learning network. The iris melanin content of each iris layers was evaluated by melanin concentration rate (MCR) from PS-AS-OCT images. The iris color measurements were extracted in the CIE L*a*b* (CIELAB) color space from the iris surface photographs. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between iris MCR parameters and iris L*a*b* values. Additionally,traditional three-category grading was also used for comparisons of parameters among three iris color categories and to examine the accuracy of iris color clustering using iris MCR parameters by the KNN model.
Results: The analysis included 88 participants with a mean age of 39 years (range 18&ndash;64 years). We observed a significant negative correlation between melanin concentration rate (MCR) of the whole iris and particularly the iris stroma layers with iris color in L*a*b* values. A higher MCR of the iris stroma was correlated with darker colors, exhibiting lower L* (r=-0.72, P&amp;lt;0.001), a* (r=-0.56, P&amp;lt;0.001), and b* (r=-0.68, P&amp;lt;0.001) values. The MCR of the iris stroma also shows significant differences among the three grades (P&amp;lt;0.001). For the classification of the iris color grading by iris stroma MCR, the accuracy for the KNN model reached 85%.
Conclusions: The MCR of the iris stroma, as measured by PS-AS-OCT, demonstrated a strong correlation with iris color. This suggests the feasibility of assessing iris melanin content using PS-AS-OCT, which may offer an additional avenue for investigating iris pigment.

# Classification of schizophrenia spectrum disorder using machine learning and functional connectivity: reconsidering the clinical application

## 使用机器学习和功能连接对精神分裂症谱系障碍进行分类: 重新考虑临床应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5400516/latest

Background Early identification of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD) is crucial for effective intervention and prognosis improvement. Previous neuroimaging-based classifications have primarily focused on chronic, medicated SSD cohorts. However, the question remains whether brain metrics identified in these populations can serve as trait biomarkers for early-stage SSD. This study investigates whether brain metrics identified in chronic, medicated SSD can function as trait biomarkers for early-stage SSD.Methods Data were collected from 502 SSD patients and 575 healthy controls (HCs) across four medical institutions. Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) features were used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on individuals with medicated chronic SSD and HCs from three sites. The remaining site, comprising both chronic medicated and first-episode unmedicated SSD patients, was used for independent validation. A univariable analysis examined the association between medication dosage or illness duration and FC.Results The classifier achieved 69% accuracy (P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;2.86e-13), 63% sensitivity, and 75% specificity when tested on an independent dataset. Subgroup analysis showed 71% sensitivity (P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;4.63e-05) for chronic medicated SSD, but poor generalization to first-episode unmedicated SSD (sensitivity&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;48%, P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.68). Univariable analysis revealed a significant association between FC and medication usage, but not disease duration.Conclusions Classifiers developed on chronic medicated SSD may predominantly capture state features of chronicity and medication, overshadowing potential SSD traits. This partially explains the current classifiers' non-generalizability across SSD patients with different clinical states, underscoring the need for models that can enhance the early detection of schizophrenia neural pathology.

# Machine Learning to classify the Depth of Reflection in STEM Student Writings&nbsp;

## 机器学习对STEM学生写作中的反思深度进行分类

Assessing &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;reflective writing is essential for students&rsquo; learning. There is a growing &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;need to improve the evaluation of reflective writing skills that students can &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;organise their thoughts into a logical structure and connect new information &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with existing knowledge. However, manually analysing reflective writing is &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;time-consuming and subjective, and there is a need for automation to make the &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;process more reliable.
This &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;study aims to investigate the potential use of machine learning and natural &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;language processing to enhance the assessing process of reflective writing. In &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;order to explore this research gap. &amp;nbsp;Firstly, the study investigates of seven &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;reflection indicators in terms of Natural &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Language Processing (NLP) into four groups of feature extraction (n-grams, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PoS n-grams, sentiment features, and WordNet-Affect features) according to &amp;nbsp;Reflective Writing Framework (RWF). Secondly, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the automated RWF investigates of NLP&rsquo;s &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;findings with a wide range of machine learning algorithms to detect the &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;reflection levels in text.
The &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;study showed that the evaluation of the automated reflective writing analysis &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is reliable and valid, as measured by Cohen&rsquo;s &kappa; ranged from 0.46 to 0.75 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;across the seven indicators and 0.40 and 0.72 for the three reflection &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;levels, demonstrating moderate to substantial agreement.
This &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;research sheds light on important parts that need to be considered when &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;attempting to improve the automated assessment of reflective writing. The &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;contribution of this research is represented by the new knowledge it unearths &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;related to reflection and its automated assessment using machine learning &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;techniques.

# Rapid Diagnosis of Membranous Nephropathy Based on Kidney Tissue Raman Spectroscopy and Deep Learning

## 基于肾脏组织拉曼光谱和深度学习的膜性肾病快速诊断

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5223302/latest

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the most common causes of glomerular disease in clinical settings. Renal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing MN, but it is invasive and poses risks such as renal hemorrhage, perirenal hematoma, and infection. Furthermore, conventional light and electron microscopy techniques fail to distinguish between primary and secondary MN. The recent identification of autoantibodies against phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) and thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) antigens has provided key insights into the pathophysiology of MN. Although immunofluorescence assays for detecting serum anti-PLA2R antibodies and glomerular PLA2R antigens are used clinically to diagnose PLA2R-related MN, only 52%-86% of PLA2R-associated MN patients exhibit positive anti-PLA2R antibodies. Recent advances in Raman spectroscopy combined with deep learning methods offer promising non-invasive diagnostic approaches. Our previous studies demonstrated the high diagnostic efficacy of Raman spectroscopy for MN using human serum and urine samples, with excellent sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we present a rapid diagnostic method for MN based on Raman spectroscopy of mouse kidney tissue combined with a CNN-BiLSTM deep learning model. The model achieved 98% accuracy, with specificity and sensitivity of 98.3%, offering a novel supplementary tool for the pathological diagnosis of MN.

The potential downsides of standard treatments of Apremilast and Roflumilast include gastrointestinal side effects, the risk of mental episodes, and drug interactions, among other things. The rationale of the study is to pay attention to global efforts by describing currently underexplored chemical space regions. The objective was to investigate PDE4D inhibitors utilizing the dark chemical database. The goal was to address this by conducting a computational analysis that coupled docking with molecular dynamics, phase screening, and compound pharmacokinetics optimisation utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are key parts of drug discovery and development processes. We established the binding mode and critical residues (GLN-369, ILE-336, PHE-340, and PHE-372) involved in interactions with 1,39,353 dark chemical matter molecules out of which 15 hits were obtained and subjected to artificial intelligence (PK parameters) and MD simulations. RMSD and stable amino acids interact with four promising molecules 027230, 060628, 060576 and 085881. The ligand 085881 was found promising since it inhibits both IL-6 and TNF-alpha with IC50 of 18.41 &amp;micro;M and 34.43 &amp;micro;M respectively. In-vivo Erythema grading showed that 085881 test substances possess mild to moderate antipsoriatic action.

This study introduces and validates the concept of "daring activation energy" - a distinct motivational-cognitive state that emerges under specific environmental conditions in primary education. Through a year-long experiment involving four experimental classes (N&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;93) with corresponding control groups, we demonstrate how systematic environmental redesign enables extraordinary learning engagement and accelerated cognitive development, with experimental groups showing significant IQ gains (∆=6 points, p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;.01) and remarkable learning acceleration. These outcomes were achieved through minimal intervention (10% of academic time), suggesting efficient transformation possibilities within existing educational systems. Our findings extend Self-Determination Theory by demonstrating how institutional structures can systematically support intrinsic motivation emergence, offering both theoretical framework and practical evidence for transforming educational practice.

# Personalized Prediction of Gait Freezing Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition

## 基于动态模式分解的步态冻结个性化预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5127334/latest

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common severe gait disorder in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The ability to predict the onset of FOG episodes early on allows for timely intervention, which is essential for improving the life quality of patients. Machine learning and deep learning, the current methods, face real-time diagnosis challenges due to comprehensive data processing requirements. Their ''black box'' nature makes interpreting features and classification boundaries difficult. In this manuscript, we explored a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based approach together with optimal delay embedding time to reconstruct and predict the time evolution of acceleration signals, and introduced a triple index based on DMD to predict and classify FOG. Our predictive analysis shows 86.45% accuracy in classification, and an early prediction rate of 81.97% of all samples with an average early prediction time of 6.13 seconds. This DMD-based approach has the potential for real-time patient specific FOG prediction.

# Combined machine learning models, docking analysis, molecular dynamics and experimental validation for the rapid design of novel FLT3 inhibitors against AML

## 结合机器学习模型、对接分析、分子动力学和实验验证快速设计新型FLT3抑制剂治疗AML

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5393379/latest

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant clonal disorder driven by the excessive proliferation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood, often linked to Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations, which occur in about one-third of AML patients. While FLT3 inhibitors such as Midostaurin, Quizartinib, and Gilteritinib have demonstrated clinical efficacy, their therapeutic potential is often limited by drug resistance and adverse reactions. Therefore, the development of novel FLT3 inhibitors is critical for improving AML treatment outcomes. In this study, we employed a multi-faceted computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach, integrating machine learning (ML), molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, to accelerate the discovery of new FLT3 inhibitors. A machine learning-based FLT3 classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.958, while an MV4-11 cell activity prediction model demonstrated strong predictive performance with an R2 of 0.846, MAE of 0.368, and RMSE of 0.492. Virtual screening of 7,280 compounds from the ChemDiv database led to the identification of 68 potential FLT3 inhibitors, with molecular dynamics simulations confirming their stable binding to the FLT3 protein. Experimental validation of four selected compounds showed promising activity in MV4-11 cellular assays, demonstrating the reliability of this integrated CADD approach. These results underscore the potential of a CADD-driven approach, enhanced by ML, to rapidly design new FLT3 inhibitors for AML treatment.

## Yolo-stod: 基于Yolov5算法的工业输送带撕裂检测模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5155950/latest

Real-time detection of conveyor belt tearing is of great significance to ensure mining in the coal industry. The longitudinal tear damage problem of conveyor belts has the characteristics of multi-scale, abundant small targets, and complex interference sources. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of small-size tear damage detection algorithms under complex interference, we propose a visual detection method YOLO-STOD based on deep learning. Firstly, a multi-case conveyor belt tear datasets is developed for complex interference and small-size detection. Second, the detection method YOLO-STOD is designed, which utilizes the BotNet attention mechanism to extract multi-dimensional tearing features, enhancing the model's feature extraction ability for small targets and enables the model to converge quickly under the conditions of few samples. Secondly, Shape_IOU is utilized to calculate the training loss, and the shape regression loss of the bounding box itself is considered to enhance the robustness of the model. Finally, the detection performance of the designed algorithm in complex environments is verified. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high detection accuracy and detection rate compared with existing detection algorithms, and it is expected to be used for real-time detection of conveyor belt tearing in the industrial field.

# Training the Next Generation of Robotic Colorectal Surgeons in East London. A Systematic Review of Existing Robotic Colorectal Surgery Programs Worldwide

## 在东伦敦培训下一代机器人结直肠外科医生。对全球现有机器人结直肠手术计划的系统评价

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5089922/latest

Background: Robotic-assisted colorectal surgery (RACS) is gaining widespread adoption, with a growing number of procedures performed globally. These have been performed mostly by consultants, many of whom have gained sufficient proficiency to begin to educate their trainees. RACS offers a range of benefits to the surgeon and patient, yet safe and effective utilisation hinges on well-structured training programs for colorectal trainees within their general surgery residency. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the structure currently employed worldwide in RACS training programs for colorectal surgery trainees. In addition it delineates the conceptualization and implementation of a locally developed RACS program tailored to senior colorectal trainees and fellows at our Trust.
Methods: A comprehensive search of Ovid Medline and Embase databases (January 2010- March 2024) following PRISMA guidelines identified six studies reporting on RACS training curricula. Critical analysis of programme structure and curricula tools utilised was performed. Articles involving training of consultants were excluded. The quality and bias score of each study were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Score for observational studies.
Results: 6 out of 77 studies were selected as suitable for analysis describing RACS training using Da Vinci platform. All apart from one programme described a phased or parallel robotic curriculum with four studies incorporating theoretical knowledge and laboratory or cadaveric training. Six programmes incorporated simulation, bedside assisting and console training. The use of validated objective or subjective metrics at each phase varied. Formal feedback is provided in only two of the programmes. Reflecting on above results we present our Trust training program which run over the last two years.Our program ensures clear learning goals for trainees and trainers, maintains patient safety, and is easily replicated across other UK RACS units.
Conclusion: The establishment of a standardised curriculum for colorectal surgery training worldwide, including in the UK, is vital. Currently, there is a scarcity of validated, objective assessment methods, which must be adequately standardised to create consistent progression criteria and competency-based metrics. Standardising these methods will enable reliable and robust assessment of trainee progression and competence to create a generation of robotically competent colorectal surgeons within their standard training program timeframe.

## FinTechFake: 一种基于语言的人工智能方法，用于检测金融中的假新闻

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5520580/latest

The spread of misleading information on social media and internet forums has posed a serious danger to organizations and enterprises. This paper proposes an ensemble learning-based artificial intelligence approach called FinTechFake for financial fake news detection. Due to the public unavailability of the financial fake news dataset, we created a financial fake news dataset from the existing benchmark fake news dataset using topic modeling approaches. Substantial feature engineering has been investigated to extract the best-suited linguistic aspects that include sentence cohesion, stance, sentiment, and other grammatical features. Furthermore, linguistic features are combined with word embedding-based characteristics to apply an ensemble learning approach for the automatic detection of financial fake news from large text corpora. In terms of classification accuracy, both XGBoost and LGBM produce good results with 96.8% accuracy. When compared with the existing state-of-the-art, FinTechFake, outperformed others in terms of F1 score by 2.6%.

# Wound Healing of Boiologically and Chemically Syntehsized Gold Nanoparticles through Scratch Assay and Neural Network Modeling

## 通过划痕分析和神经网络建模对生物和化学合成的金纳米颗粒进行伤口愈合

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5124354/latest

Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are commonly used as anti-haemorrhagic and antiseptic agents. Thus, their cytotoxicity should be studied before application. In this study, the Au NPs were synthesized using biological and chemical routes, and the samples were named as AU-BT and AU-C, respectively. The AU-BT were synthesized using three different extracts, i.e., turmeric, aloe-vera, and a mixture of turmeric aloe-vera. The cytotoxicity was studied using scratch assay on HEK-293 cell lines. The number of scratch assays was increased to validate the experimental wound healing results. Finally, a neural networking modeling was performed to predict the results of provided data in terms of the sample toxicity by healing the wound. The experimental results and the neural networking confirmed that the turmeric-derived Au NPs were the best among all the synthesized samples. Moreover, integrating metal NPs in wound healing studies introduces exciting possibilities for enhanced imaging and therapeutic interventions. The combination of advanced image analysis through models like AlexNet and the novel use of nanoparticles opens doors to improved wound care and a deeper understanding of the healing process.

# Dynamic Relevance Learning for Few-Shot Object Detection

## 基于动态关联学习的少镜头目标检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5203328/latest

Expensive bounding-box annotations have limited the development of object detection task. Thus, it is necessary to focus on more challenging task of few-shot object detection. It requires the detector to recognize objects of novel classes with only a few training samples. Nowadays, many existing popular methods adopting training way similar to meta-learning have achieved promising performance, such as Meta R-CNN series. However, support data is only used as the class attention to guide the detecting of query images each time. Their relevance to each other remains unexploited. Moreover, a lot of recent works treat the support data and query images as independent branch without considering the relationship between them. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic relevance learning model, which utilizes the relationship between all support images and Region of Interest (RoI) on the query images to construct a dynamic graph convolutional network (GCN). By adjusting the prediction distribution of the base detector using the output of this GCN, the proposed model serves as a hard auxiliary classification task, which guides the detector to improve the class representation implicitly. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO dataset. The proposed model achieves the best overall performance, which shows its effectiveness of learning more generalized features.

# ToxACoL: An Endpoint-Aware and Task-Focused Compound Representation Learning Paradigm for Acute Toxicity Assessment

## ToxACoL: 用于急性毒性评估的端点感知和以任务为重点的复合表示学习范式

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5513730/latest

Chemical safety assessment is critical in the early stages of drug discovery and ecological risk assessment. Multi-species acute toxicity assessment is typically conducted as the initial phase to determine whether chemicals can proceed to industrial use or clinical trials. Although deep learning has shown promise in acute toxicity evaluation, inherent challenges such as diverse experimental conditions, imbalanced endpoint data, and scarce target endpoint data are often overlooked. This hinders existing methods from revealing associations among multi-condition endpoints, and leads to poor predictive performance for data-scarce target endpoints, especially those related to humans. Here we propose a novel machine learning paradigm, Adjoint Correlation Learning, for multi-condition acute toxicity assessment (ToxACoL) to address these challenges. ToxACoL models biological associations among multi-species, multi-condition toxicity endpoints via graph topology and achieves knowledge transfer via graph convolution. An adjoint correlation mechanism encodes compounds and endpoints synchronously, enabling an endpoint-aware and task-focused representation learning for compounds. Comprehensive analyses demonstrate that ToxACoL successfully balances performance across multi-condition endpoints, yielding 43%-115% improvements for data-scarce human-related endpoints, while reducing required training data by approximately 70% to 80%. Furthermore, investigation into the visualization and interpretability of the top-level representation learned by ToxACoL elucidates the structural alert mechanisms behind acute toxicity and highlights the potential for extrapolating animal test results to humans when integrated with the filled-in toxicity values.

## EchoApex: 超声心动图的通用视觉基础模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5332987/latest

Quantitative evaluation of echocardiography is essential for precise assessment of cardiac condition and guiding treatment decisions. The diverse nature of echo images, including variations in probe types, manufacturers, and pathologies, poses challenges for developing artificial intelligent models that can generalize across different clinical practice. Here, we introduce EchoApex, a general-purpose vision foundation model designed for comprehensive echocardiography analysis. Pretrained on over 20 million images from 11 clinical centers, EchoApex utilizes self-supervised learning and task-specific decoders for diverse applications in echocardiography. It performs sequence view classification, interactive structure segmentation, left ventricle measurement, and ejection fraction estimation. In benchmark evaluations, EchoApex outperforms task-specific models, achieving a mean BACC of 0.976 in classification of 18 common views, DICE of 0.93 in chamber segmentation, MAE of 3.9mm in left ventricle linear measurement and a zero-shot performance improvement over specialist models in all evaluated datasets. For ejection fraction estimation, EchoApex achieves an MAE of 5.6% and an AUC of 0.927 for cardiomyopathy detection. Despite using less than 4% of trainable parameters with frozen encoders, EchoApex with adapter demonstrates strong performance with minimal degradation compared to fully finetuned models. This work establishes EchoApex as a scalable, general-purpose model for echocardiography, enabling efficient adaptation across various clinical tasks.

# Noise-Aware Training of Neuromorphic Dynamic Device Networks

## 神经形态动态设备网络的噪声感知训练

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5033914/latest

Physical computing has the potential to enable widespread embodied intelligence by leveraging the intrinsic dynamics of complex systems for efficient sensing, processing, and interaction. While individual devices provide basic data processing capabilities, networks of interconnected devices can perform more complex and varied tasks. However, designing networks to perform dynamic tasks is challenging without physical models and accurate quantification of device noise. We propose a novel, noise-aware methodology for training device networks using Neural Stochastic Differential equations
(Neural-SDEs) as differentiable digital twins, accurately capturing the dynamics and associated stochasticity of devices with intrinsic memory. Our approach employs backpropagation through time and cascade learning, allowing networks to effectively exploit the temporal properties of physical devices. We validate our method on diverse networks of spintronic devices across temporal classification and regression benchmarks. By decoupling the training of individual device models from network training, our method reduces the required training data and provides a robust framework for programming dynamical devices without relying on analytical descriptions of their dynamics.

# Facial Expression-Driven Rehabilitation Robotics: A Machine Learning Approach with Stretchable Sensors

## 面部表情驱动的康复机器人: 一种具有可拉伸传感器的机器学习方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5599748/latest

Wearable sensor technology has shown significant promise in advancing personalized healthcare and rehabilitation. This study presents the implementation of stretchable sensors for facial expression recognition (FER) to control an upper limb rehabilitation robot. Traditional rehabilitation approaches, which rely heavily on therapist-administered exercises, face limitations such as variability in patient engagement and environmental constraints. To address these issues, we developed a low-cost, flexible sensor system capable of detecting subtle facial muscle deformations and translating them into control commands via a Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Our system classifies four emotional states &mdash; Neutral, Happy, Sad, and Disgust &mdash; with a classification accuracy of 92.4\%. Real-time performance tests on five subjects controlling an elbow rehabilitation robot demonstrated an average accuracy of 75\% for FER. Motor speed adjustments, driven by recognized expressions, dynamically adapt to patient comfort levels, thereby personalizing the rehabilitation process. The stretchable sensor system offers advantages over traditional methods like EMG and computer vision, including greater reliability, low computational demands, and reduced susceptibility to noise.This study highlights the potential of emotion-driven adaptive rehabilitation robots in improving patient outcomes and engagement. Future work will explore refining sensor placement, enhancing machine learning models, and extending the system to other rehabilitation contexts. Integrating such intelligent wearable systems marks a significant step toward more accessible and empathetic tele-rehabilitation solutions.

# Investigation of Hardware Testing Utilizing Standard 4-D Convolution and Optimized Deep Convolution Formulas

## 利用标准4-D卷积和优化的深度卷积公式进行硬件测试的研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5596533/latest

The purpose of this study is to discuss the application and performance of the standard four-dimensional convolution calculation and optimization deep convolution formula in hardware testing. With the wide application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [1] in image processing, video processing and other fields, how to efficiently complete these computing tasks on resource-limited hardware platforms has become a key problem. Although standard four-dimensional convolution is widely used, its computational complexity and resource consumption limit its application in large-scale convolutional networks. For this reason, deep convolutional optimization techniques are proposed to reduce the computation and memory footprint. However, as CNN goes deeper, parameters required by convolution increase sharply, which makes the on-chip memory solution inefficient [2]. In this study, field programmable gate array (FPGA) was used as a test platform to evaluate the resource consumption difference between standard convolution and deep convolution by comparing their parameters, computing time and power consumption under different hardware conditions. Test results show that deep convolution reduces memory footprint by about 90%, computation time by about 70%, and power consumption by about 50%. Studies have shown that deep convolution performs well on resource-constrained hardware platforms, especially for low-power devices such as mobile terminals and edge computing devices. In summary, deep convolutions provide an efficient and low-power solution for modern convolutional neural network hardware implementations.Key Words: Standard Four-Dimensional Convolution, Deep Convolution, hardware testing, optimization, CNNS.
