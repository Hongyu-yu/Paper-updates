# Selective Hydrogen Molecule Dissociation on Ca2N Monolayer

## 选择性氢分子在Ca2N单层上的解离

**Authors:** Gwan Woo Kim, Soonmin Jang, Gunn Kim

Abstract: Developing efficient hydrogen storage and conversion technologies is essential for sustainable energy. This study investigates the catalytic potential of a dicalcium nitride (Ca2N) monolayer for hydrogen dissociation using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We find that atomic hydrogen preferentially adsorbs at Ca-centered hollow sites (labeled A sites), while molecular hydrogen adsorption is limited to bridge sites (labeled B sites). AIMD simulations reveal that H2 dissociation at B sites inhibits further adsorption, suggesting a mechanism of controlled H2 dissociation. The current findings emphasize the potential of pristine Ca2N as a catalyst for H2 dissociation-related processes and motivate future investigations of its activity in hydrogen evolution reactions.

# Dynamic Modulation of Electronic and Optical Properties in GaN Bilayers by Interlayer Sliding

## 层间滑动对GaN双层中电子与光学性质的动态调制

**Authors:** Heeju Kim, Gunn Kim

arXiv:2501.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a first-principles investigation of the electronic and optical properties of gallium nitride (GaN) bilayers, focusing on the influence of interlayer sliding and spacing. In contrast to the earlier studies on discrete stacking configurations, we explore the dynamic evolution of the properties during transitions between stable stacking arrangements. Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically analyze the impact of these structural variations on the electronic band structure and optical absorption spectra of GaN bilayers. The analysis includes both high-symmetry stacking configurations (AA', AB', and AC') and intermediate states generated by controlled in-plane atomic displacements, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the property changes associated with interlayer sliding. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential for tuning the electronic and optical response of two-dimensional GaN for applications in nanoscale photonic and electronic devices, where precise control over interlayer interactions and stacking is crucial.

# Tuning Catalytic Efficiency: Thermodynamic Optimization of Zr-Doped \ce{Ti3C2} and \ce{Ti3CN} MXenes for HER Catalysis

**Authors:** Shrestha Dutta, Rudra Banerjee

arXiv:2501.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen production via the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is critical for sustainable energy solutions, yet the reliance on expensive platinum (Pt) catalysts limits scalability. Zirconium-doped (\ce{Zr}-doped) MXenes, such as \ce{Ti3C2} and \ce{Ti3CN}, emerge as transformative alternatives, combining abundance, tunable electronic properties, and high catalytic potential. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we show that \ce{Zr} doping at 3\% and 7\% significantly enhances HER activity by reducing the work function to the optimal range of 3.5-4.5~eV and achieving near-zero Gibbs free energy (\dgh) values of 0.18-0.16~eV, conditions ideal for efficient hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Bader charge analysis reveals substantial charge redistribution with enhanced electron accumulation at \ce{Zr} and \ce{N} sites, further driving catalytic performance. This synergy between optimized electronic structure and catalytic properties establishes \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as cost-effective, high-performance alternatives to noble metals for HER. By combining exceptional catalytic efficiency with scalability, our work positions \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as a breakthrough for green hydrogen production, offering a robust pathway toward renewable energy technologies and advancing the design of next-generation non-precious metal catalysts.

Abstract: We have studied the electrochemical performance of the delta-5 boron monolayer as an anode material for alkali metal (AM) and alkali earth metal (AEM) ion batteries using density functional theory simulations. The electronic properties, adsorption, diffusion rate, and storage behavior of various metal atoms (M) in the {\delta}-5 boron monolayer are explored. Our study shows that the delta-5 boron monolayer possesses high electrical conductivity and a low activation barrier for electron and metal ion transit (0.46-1.72 eV), indicating a fast charge/discharge rate. Furthermore, the theoretical capacities of the {\delta}-5 boron monolayer for Li, Na, and K are found to be greater than those of commercial graphite. The average open-circuit voltage for AM and AEM is reasonably low and in the range of 0.14-0.88 V. Our results show that {\delta}-5 boron monolayer could be a promising anode material in lithium-ion and non-lithium ion rechargeable batteries.

Abstract: Palladium diselenide (PdSe$_2$) -- a layered van der Waals material -- is attracting significant attention for optoelectronics due to the wide tunability of its band gap from the infrared through the visible range as a function of the number of layers. However, there continues to be disagreement over the precise nature and value of the optical band gap of bulk PdSe$_2$, owing to the rather small value of this gap that complicates experimental measurements and their interpretation. Here, we design and employ a Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional to investigate the electronic bandstructures and optical absorption spectra of bulk and monolayer PdSe$_2$. In particular, we account carefully for the finite exciton center-of-mass momentum within a time-dependent WOT-SRSH framework to calculate the \emph{indirect} optical gap and absorption onset accurately. Our results agree well with the best available photoconductivity measurements, as well as with state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory calculations, confirming that bulk PdSe$_2$ has an optical gap in the mid-infrared (upper-bound of 0.44 eV). More generally, this work further bolsters the utility of the WOT-SRSH approach for predictive modeling of layered semiconductors.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, possess unique physical and chemical properties, enabling diverse applications in fields ranging from energy storage to communication, catalysis, sensing, healthcare, and beyond. The transition metal and nonmetallic atoms in MXenes can exhibit distinct coordination environments, potentially leading to a wide variety of 2D phases. Despite extensive research and significant advancements, a fundamental understanding of MXenes' phase diversity and its relationship with their hierarchical precursors, including intermediate MAX phases and parent bulk phases, remains limited. Using high-throughput modeling based on first-principles density functional theory, we unveil a wide range of MXenes and comprehensively evaluate their relative stabilities across a large chemical space. The key lies in considering both octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination environments characteristic of various bulk phases. Through this comprehensive structural library of MXenes, we uncover a close alignment between the phase stability of MXenes and that of their hierarchical 3D counterparts. Building on this, we demonstrate a new design strategy where the atomic coordination environments in parent bulk phases can serve as reliable predictors for the design of MXenes, reducing reliance on intermediate MAX phases. Our study significantly expands the landscape of MXenes, at least doubling the number of possible structures.

arXiv:2501.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical selection rules endorsed by symmetry are crucial for understanding the optical properties of quantum materials and the associated ultrafast spectral phenomena. Herein, we introduce momentum-resolved Floquet optical selection rules using the group theory to elucidate the pump-probe photoemission spectral distributions of monolayer black phosphorus (BP), which are governed by the symmetries of both the material and the lasers. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we further investigate the dynamical evolution of Floquet(-Volkov) states in the photoemission spectra of monolayer BP, revealing their spectral weights at specific momenta for each sideband. These observations are comprehensively explained by the proposed Floquet optical selection rules. Our framework not only clarifies experimental photoemission spectra but also uncovers novel characteristics under different pump-probe configurations. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of light-induced ultrafast spectra in BP and can be further extended to other Floquet systems.

**Authors:** Enze Chen, Timofey Frolov

arXiv:2501.15723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.

Abstract: We consider methods for optimizing the bandgap calculation of 3D materials, considering 340 sample materials. Examined are the effects of the choice of the pseudopotential to describe core electrons, the plane-wave basis set cutoff energy, and the Brillouin zone integration. Cost-saving calculations in which the structure is optimized using reduced-quality Brillouin zone integrations and cutoff energies were found to lead to experimentally significant errors exceeding 0.1 eV in 18% of cases using the PBE functional and 21% of cases using PBE0. Such cost-savings approaches are therefore not recommended for general applications. Also, the current practice of using unoptimized grids to perform the Brillouin-zone integrations in bandgap calculations is found to be unreliable for 16% of materials using PBE and for 23% using PBE0. A k-space optimization scheme is introduced that interpolates extensive PBE results to determine a generally useful approach that when used in PBE0 calculations is found to be inadequate for only 1.6% of the materials studied.

arXiv:2501.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of spinor quantum transport within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) code TranSIESTA based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). First-principles methods play an essential role in molecular and material modelling, and the DFT+NEGF approach has become a widely-used tool for quantum transport simulation. Exisiting (open source) DFT-based quantum transport codes either model non-equilibrium/finite-bias cases in an approximate way or rely on the collinear spin approximation. Our new implementation closes this gap and enables the TranSIESTA code to use full spinor-wave functions. Thereby it provides a method for transport simulation of topological materials and devices based on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or non-collinear spins. These materials hold enormous potential for the development of ultra-low energy electronics urgently needed for the design of sustainable technology. The new feature is tested for relevant systems determining magnetoresistance in iron nanostructures and transport properties of a lateral transition metal dichalcogenide heterojunction.

Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of an exemplar transition metal impurity in an insulator, with the goal of accurately describing strongly correlated, defect states. We consider iron in aluminum nitride, a material of interest for hybrid quantum technologies, and we carry out calculations with quantum embedding methods -- density matrix embedding theory (DMET) and quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and with spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We show that both DMET and QDET accurately describe the ground state and low-lying excited states of the defect, and that TDDFT yields photoluminescence spectra in agreement with experiments. In addition, we provide a detailed discussion of the convergence of our results as a function of the active space used in the embedding methods, thus defining a protocol to obtain converged data, directly comparable with experiments.

Abstract: The Lindblad quantum master equation is one of the central approaches to the physics of open quantum systems. In particular, boundary driving enables the study of transport, where a steady state emerges in the long-time limit, which features a constant current and a characteristic density profile. While the Lindblad equation complements other approaches to transport in closed quantum systems, it has become clear that a connection between closed and open systems exists in certain cases. Here, we build on this connection for magnetization transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with and without integrability-breaking perturbations. Specifically, we study the question whether the time evolution of the open quantum system can be described on the basis of classical correlation functions, as generated by the Hamiltonian equations of motion for real vectors. By comparing to exact numerical simulations of the Lindblad equation, we find a good accuracy of such a description for a range of model parameters, which is consistent with previous studies on closed systems. While this agreement is an interesting physical observation, it also suggests that classical mechanics can be used to solve the Lindblad equation for comparatively large system sizes, which lie outside the possibilities of a quantum mechanical treatment. We also point out counterexamples and limitations for the quantitative extraction of transport coefficients. Remarkably, our classical approach to large open systems allows to detect superdiffusion at the isotropic point.

Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.

Abstract: Dual-unitary quantum circuits have recently attracted attention as an analytically tractable model of many-body quantum dynamics. Consisting of a 1+1D lattice of 2-qudit gates arranged in a 'brickwork' pattern, these models are defined by the constraint that each gate must remain unitary under swapping the roles of space and time. This dual-unitarity restricts the dynamics of local operators in these circuits: the support of any such operator must grow at the effective speed of light of the system, along one or both of the edges of a causal light cone set by the geometry of the circuit. Using this property, it is shown here that for 1+1D dual-unitary circuits the set of width-$w$ conserved densities (constructed from operators supported over $w$ consecutive sites) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of width-$w$ solitons - operators which, up to a multiplicative phase, are simply spatially translated at the effective speed of light by the dual-unitary dynamics. A number of ways to construct these many-body solitons (explicitly in the case where the local Hilbert space dimension $d=2$) are then demonstrated: firstly, via a simple construction involving products of smaller, constituent solitons; and secondly, via a construction which cannot be understood as simply in terms of products of smaller solitons, but which does have a neat interpretation in terms of products of fermions under a Jordan-Wigner transformation. This provides partial progress towards a characterisation of the microscopic structure of complex many-body solitons (in dual-unitary circuits on qubits), whilst also establishing a link between fermionic models and dual-unitary circuits, advancing our understanding of what kinds of physics can be explored in this framework.

Abstract: Zinc phosphorus trisulfide (ZnPS$_3$), a promising material for photocatalysis and energy storage, is shown in this study to exhibit remarkable stability under extreme conditions. We explore its optical and structural properties under high pressure and cryogenic temperatures using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Raman scattering, and density functional theory (DFT). Our results identify a pressure-induced phase transition starting at 6.75 GPa and stabilizing by 12.5 GPa, after which ZnPS$_3$ demonstrates robust stability across a broad pressure range of 15 to 100 GPa. DFT calculations predict a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition at 100 GPa, while PL measurements reveal defect-assisted emissions that quench under pressure due to enhanced non-radiative recombination. At cryogenic temperatures, PL quenching intensifies as non-radiative processes dominate, driven by a rising Gr\"uneisen parameter and reduced phonon population. Cryogenic X-ray diffraction (XRD) also reveals a high mean thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of (4.369 $\pm$ 0.393) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ K$^{-1}$, among the highest reported for 2D materials. This unique combination of tunable electronic properties under low pressure and high thermal sensitivity makes ZnPS$_3$ a strong candidate for sensing applications in extreme environments.

Abstract: We numerically study the quantum dynamics of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric kicked harmonic oscillator. We observe that directed current of momentum and ballistic diffusion of energy coexist under the non-resonant conditions, whereas both the momentum and energy oscillate as damped cosine functions with identical frequencies under the resonant conditions. The research shows that the directed current of momentum and ballistic diffusion of energy arise from nearest-neighbor hopping between momentum eigenstates with the non-Hermitian driving, while the damped oscillations of momentum and energy originate from resonant coupling between the non-Hermitian driving and the harmonic oscillator. Our findings indicate that the non-Hermiticity and the frequency characteristic of this system collectively result in these distinctive dynamical behaviors.

**Authors:** William H., Green

Accurate and efficient computations of standard enthalpies of formation (Hf) for small organic molecules are crucial for diverse chemical engineering and scientific applications. Building upon our earlier work [J. Phys. Chem. A 2024, 128, 21, 4335–4352], we systematically benchmark 284 model chemistries for Hf computations. These methods span semiempirical approaches, density functional theory (DFT), wave function theory, and composite schemes. We derive Petersson- and Melius-type bond-additivity corrections (BACs) for each method using a curated database of 421 reference species. We further validate the top-performing methods using an independent test set of 500 species including ions, radicals, and other challenging cases. Across nearly all methods and species, BACs significantly improve accuracy, especially for neutral singlet species. Composite schemes coupling moderate-level DFT geometries with local coupled-cluster single-point energies strike an excellent balance between cost and accuracy, often approaching chemical accuracy ($\leq$ 1 kcal/mol). Notably, DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12d/cc-pVTZ-F12//ωB97X-D/def2-TZVPD with Petersson BAC attains the benchmark-best mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.57 kcal/mol. Remarkably, switching to DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12d/cc-pVDZ-F12//GFN2-xTB substantially reduces the computational cost by an order of magnitude while modestly increasing the MAE (0.96 kcal/mol). Although carefully tuned model chemistries can also benefit charged and open-shell species, the scarcity of robust reference data in these areas highlights the need for broader, high-accuracy thermochemistry datasets. Overall, this benchmark provides practical guidance on selecting optimal model chemistries to efficiently compute accurate Hf under varied computational constraints and molecular complexities, laying a foundation for large-scale, high-throughput thermochemical calculations that will support data-driven discovery and industrial applications.

Enzymatic systems efficiently catalyze the E/Z isomerization of C=C double bonds by thiol-based cysteine residues, while artificial reactions utilizing thiol-based molecules have remained stoichiometric, not catalytic. Herein, we report a catalytic isomerization of maleate to fumarate under mild temperatures using molecular catalysts based on cysteine and its analogs, activated via chemical or photochemical radical processes. Kinetic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) study support an aqueous thiyl radical-catalyzed reaction. The reaction exhibits first-order dependence on the reactant concentration, zeroth-order dependence on the thiol molecule concentration, and first-order with respect to the radical initiator concentration. The catalytic turnover number of 2,500 and initial catalytic turnover frequency of 1.1 s‒1 have been achieved on a small scale in the presence of thiyl radicals, while the gram-scale synthesis is
also achieved by the aqueous thiyl catalysis. Chemical “mutational” studies reveal the importance of both the thiol unit and the intramolecular adjacent groups for efficient catalysis.

# Beryllium-Vacancy Color Centers in Diamonds: a Candidate Quantum Spin Sensor

## 钻石中的铍空位色心: 候选量子自旋传感器

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5852523/latest

Diamond color centers represent distinctive solid-state spin systems with unique spintronic and optical properties, making them promising candidates for applications in nanoscale quantum sensors, single-photon sources, and quantum information. In this study, density functional theory is employed to investigate the potential of the beryllium-vacancy (BeV) color center in diamonds, focusing on its spintronic and optical properties. The formation energy of BeV in different charge states suggests that BeV2&minus;, BeV&minus;, BeV0 can form in diamond. The geometry optimization of these structures reveals that all possess C3v symmetry. However, the calculations of electron spin occupation shows that only BeV2&minus; possesses a state spin-triplet ground state, which is located deeply inside the bandgap of pristine diamond lattice. The optical transitions and spin flipping mechanisms of BeV2&minus; are simulatively studied, revealing a prominent zero-phonon line (ZPL) at 582 nm, well within the visible light range. The effects of electron donors on the ZPL have also been explored as a confirmation in a doped system. These calculations demonstrate that BeV2&minus; is a potential candidate for color center. This work may pave the way for future experimental investigations into the identification and characterization of the BeV center, as well as its potential applications in alternative nanoscale quantum sensors.
