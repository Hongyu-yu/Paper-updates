Abstract: Zinc phosphorus trisulfide (ZnPS$_3$), a promising material for photocatalysis and energy storage, is shown in this study to exhibit remarkable stability under extreme conditions. We explore its optical and structural properties under high pressure and cryogenic temperatures using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Raman scattering, and density functional theory (DFT). Our results identify a pressure-induced phase transition starting at 6.75 GPa and stabilizing by 12.5 GPa, after which ZnPS$_3$ demonstrates robust stability across a broad pressure range of 15 to 100 GPa. DFT calculations predict a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition at 100 GPa, while PL measurements reveal defect-assisted emissions that quench under pressure due to enhanced non-radiative recombination. At cryogenic temperatures, PL quenching intensifies as non-radiative processes dominate, driven by a rising Gr\"uneisen parameter and reduced phonon population. Cryogenic X-ray diffraction (XRD) also reveals a high mean thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of (4.369 $\pm$ 0.393) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ K$^{-1}$, among the highest reported for 2D materials. This unique combination of tunable electronic properties under low pressure and high thermal sensitivity makes ZnPS$_3$ a strong candidate for sensing applications in extreme environments.

Abstract: Compared to traditional superhard materials with high electron density and strong covalent bonds, alloy materials mainly composed of metallic bonding structures typically have great toughness and lower hardness. Breaking through the limits of alloy materials is a preface and long term topic, which is of great significance and value for improving the comprehensive mechanical properties of alloy materials. Here, we report on the discovery of a cubic alloy semiconducting material Ti2Co with large Vickers of hardness Hvexp = 6.7 GPa and low fracture toughness of KICexp =1.51 MPa m0.5. Unexpectedly, the former value is nearly triple of the Hvcal = 2.66 GPa predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the latter value is about one or two orders of magnitude smaller than that of ordinary titanium alloy materials (KICexp = 30-120 MPa m0.5).These specifications place Ti2Co far from the phase space of the known alloy materials, but close to medium hardness materials such as MgO or TiO2. Upon incorporation of oxygen into structural void positions, both values were simultaneously improved for Ti4Co2O to = 9.7 GPa and 2.19 MPa m0.5, respectively. Further DFT calculations on the electron localization function of Ti4Co2X (X = B, C, N, O) vs. the interstitial elements indicate that these simultaneous improvements originate from the coexistence of Ti-Co metallic bonds, the emergence of newly oriented Ti-X covalent bonds, and the increase of electron concentration. Moreover, the large difference between Hvexp and Hvcal of Ti2Co suggests underlying mechanism concerning the absence of the O(16d) or Ti2-O bonds in the O-(Ti2)6 octahedron.Our discovery expands the phase space of alloy materials and illuminates the path of exploring superconducting materials with excellent mechanical performances.

Abstract: Li-CO$_2$ batteries show promise as energy storage solutions, offering high theoretical energy density and CO$_2$ fixation. Their performance relies on the formation and decomposition of Li$_2$CO$_3$/C during discharge and charge cycles, respectively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with a Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, Li$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$ concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li$_2$CO$_3$ can form toroidal and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the performance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be significantly improved by enhancing CO$_2$ transport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture.

Abstract: Tungsten-copper (W-Cu) compounds are widely utilized in various industrial fields due to their exceptional mechanical properties. In this study, we have developed a neural-network-based deep potential (DP) model that covers a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 0 to 3,000 K, and pressures, varying from 0 to 10 GPa. This study presents a model trained using density functional theory data for full concentration CuxW100-x compounds. Through this model, we systematically investigate the structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu alloys and have the following findings. First, the bulk modulus (B) and Young's modulus (E) of W-Cu alloys exhibit a linear decline as the Cu content increases, indicating a softening trend in the CuxW100-x compounds as the Cu concentration rises. Second, a higher Cu content results in higher critical strain and lower critical stress for these compounds. A brittle-to-ductile transition in the deformation mode predicted is predicted at around 37.5 at. % Cu content. Third, tensile loading tests in the W-Cu gradient structure reveal that Cu-poor region serves as a barrier, hindering shear band propagation while promoting new shear band formation in the Cu-rich region. The above results from the DP model are anticipated to aid in exploring the physical mechanisms underlying the complex phenomena of W-Cu systems and contribute to the advancement of methodologies for materials simulation.

Abstract: We numerically study the quantum dynamics of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric kicked harmonic oscillator. We observe that directed current of momentum and ballistic diffusion of energy coexist under the non-resonant conditions, whereas both the momentum and energy oscillate as damped cosine functions with identical frequencies under the resonant conditions. The research shows that the directed current of momentum and ballistic diffusion of energy arise from nearest-neighbor hopping between momentum eigenstates with the non-Hermitian driving, while the damped oscillations of momentum and energy originate from resonant coupling between the non-Hermitian driving and the harmonic oscillator. Our findings indicate that the non-Hermiticity and the frequency characteristic of this system collectively result in these distinctive dynamical behaviors.

# On the Performance of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation for Electronic Excitations in First-Row Transition Metal Complexes

## 关于第一行过渡金属配合物中电子激发的Bethe-Salpeter方程的性能

**Authors:** Florian, Bogdain

The performance of the BSE@GW approach has been systematically tested on a series of first-row transition metal complexes. Special attention was paid to the in- terplay between metal-centered (MC) and charge transfer (CT) transitions and their ordering in the excited singlet and triplet state manifolds. Here, the commonly used time-dependent density functional theory reaches its limits and in particular shows a strong dependence on the exchange-correlation functional. In contrast, the present BSE@GW UV-VIS spectra show a good agreement with experimental results as far as the absorption spectra and their assignment are concerned. This is achieved in- dependently of the exchange-correlation functional underlying the initial guess of the GW iteration. These conclusions are drawn on the basis of an investigation of a test set including nearly pure MC transitions in triazacyclononane with diﬀerent metal centers and mixed MC-CT transitions in Fe(II) complexes with diﬀerent numbers of N-heterocyclic carbene ligands. Furthermore, important aspects of the calculations such as the dependence on the ground state equilibrium geometry or the influence of the Tamm-Dancoﬀ approximation are highlighted.
