# Stability of the long-range corrected exchange-correlation functional in time-dependent density-functional theory

## 时变密度泛函理论中长范围校正交换相关函数的稳定性

Abstract: Excitonic effects in the optical absorption spectra of solids can be described with time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) in the linear-response regime, using a simple class of approximate, long-range corrected (LRC) exchange-correlation functionals. It was recently demonstrated that the LRC approximation can also be employed in real-time TDDFT to describe exciton dynamics. Here, we investigate the numerical stability of the time-dependent LRC approach using a two-dimensional model solid. It is found that the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with an LRC vector potential becomes more and more prone to instabilities for increasing exciton binding energies. The origin of these instabilities is traced back to time-averaged violations of the zero-force theorem, which leads to a simple and robust numerical stabilization scheme. This explains and justifies a recently proposed method by Dewhurst et al., arXiv:2401.16140.

Abstract: Ultra-thin two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant attention for making next-generation optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a large-area heterojunction photodetector fabricated using a liquid metal-printed 2D $\text{SnO}_2$ layer transferred onto CdTe thin films. The resulting device demonstrates efficient broadband light sensing from visible to near-infrared wavelengths, with enhanced detectivity and faster photo response than bare CdTe photodetectors. Significantly, the device shows a nearly $10^5$-fold increase in current than the dark current level when illuminated with a 780 nm laser and achieves a specific detectivity of around $10^{12} \, \text{Jones}$, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than a device with pure CdTe thin film. Additionally, temperature-dependent optoelectronic testing shows that the device maintains a stable response up to $140^\circ \text{C}$ and generates distinctive photocurrent at temperatures up to $80^\circ \text{C}$, demonstrating its thermal stability. Using band structure analysis, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and photocurrent mapping, the formation of a $p$-$n$ junction is indicated, contributing to the enhanced photo response attributed to the efficient carrier separation by the built-in potential in the hetero-junction and the superior electron mobility of 2D $\text{SnO}_2$. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating liquid metal-exfoliated 2D materials for enhanced photodetector performance.

Abstract: Using a kinetic equation approach and Density Functional Theory, we model the nonequilibrium quasiparticle and phonon dynamics of a thin superconducting film under optical irradiation ab initio. We extend this model to develop a theory for the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires. In doing so, we create a framework for exploring new superconducting materials for enhanced device performance beyond the state-of-the-art. Though we focus in this study on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, these methods are general, and they can be extended to model other superconducting devices, including transition-edge sensors, microwave resonators, and superconducting qubits. Our methods effectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with models of nonequilibrium superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices, providing a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device-level applications.

Abstract: We study the distribution of colloidal particles confined in drying spherical droplets using both dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) and particle-based simulations. In particular, we focus on the advection-dominated regime typical of aqueous droplets drying at room temperature and systematically investigate the role of hydrodynamic interactions during this nonequilibrium process. In general, drying produces transient particle concentration gradients within the droplet in this regime, with a considerable accumulation of particles at the droplet's liquid-vapor interface. We find that these gradients become significantly larger with pairwise hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal particles instead of a free-draining hydrodynamic approximation; however, the solvent's boundary conditions at the droplet's interface (unbounded, slip, or no-slip) do not have a significant effect on the particle distribution. DDFT calculations leveraging radial symmetry of the drying droplet are in excellent agreement with particle-based simulations for free-draining hydrodynamics, but DDFT unexpectedly fails for pairwise hydrodynamic interactions after the particle concentration increases during drying, manifesting as an ejection of particles from the droplet. We hypothesize that this unphysical behavior originates from an inaccurate approximation of the two-body density correlations based on the bulk pair correlation function, which we support by measuring the confined equilibrium two-body density correlations using particle-based simulations. We identify some potential strategies for addressing this issue in DDFT.

Abstract: Accurately predicting electronic band gaps in halide perovskites using ab initio density functional theory (DFT) is essential for their application in optoelectronic devices. Standard hybrid functionals such as HSE and PBE0 can overcome the limitations of DFT with reasonable computational cost but are known to underestimate the measured band gaps for layered halide perovskites. In this study, we assess the performance of the doubly screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DSH) functional for predicting band gaps in three-dimensional (3D) and layered hybrid perovskites. We show that the DSH functional, which employs material-dependent mixing parameters derived from macroscopic dielectric constants, provides accurate band gap predictions for 3D halide perovskites when structural local disorder is considered. For layered hybrid perovskites, DSH functional based on average dielectric constants overestimates the band gaps. To improve the predictions and stay in a parameter-free ab initio workflow, we propose to use the calculated dielectric constant of the respective 3D perovskites. We find that the DSH functionals using the dielectric constants of the 3D perovskite accurately predict experimental gaps, with the lowest mean absolute errors compared to HSE and PBE0 for layered perovskites with various organic spacers, as well as for multilayered $BA_2MA_{n-1}Pb_{n}I_{3n-1}$ with n = 2, 3. Notably, the HSE functional systematically underestimates the band gaps in layered perovskites. We attribute the root of this failure to the absence of non-local long-range dielectric screening, a critical factor for halide perovskites. The computational framework introduced here provides an efficient parameter-free ab initio methodology for predicting the electronic properties of 3D and layered halide perovskites and their heterostructures, aiding in developing advanced optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.

# Forecasting long-time dynamics in quantum many-body systems by dynamic mode decomposition

Abstract: Reliable numerical computation of quantum dynamics is a fundamental challenge when the long-ranged quantum entanglement plays essential roles as in the cases governed by quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems. Here we apply a method that utilizes reliable short-time data of physical quantities to accurately forecast long-time behavior of the strongly entangled systems. We straightforwardly employ the simple dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is commonly used in fluid dynamics. Despite the simplicity of the method, the effectiveness and applicability of the DMD in quantum many-body systems such as the Ising model in the transverse field at the critical point are demonstrated, even when the time evolution at long time exhibits complicated features such as a volume-law entanglement entropy and consequential power-law decays of correlations characteristic of systems with long-ranged quantum entanglements unlike fluid dynamics. The present method, though simple, enables accurate forecasts amazingly at time as long as nearly an order of magnitude longer than that of the short-time training data. Effects of noise on the accuracy of the forecast are also investigated, because they are important especially when dealing with the experimental data. We find that a few percentages of noise do not affect the prediction accuracy destructively.

Abstract: Krylov subspace methods in quantum dynamics identify the minimal subspace in which a process unfolds. To date, their use is restricted to time evolutions governed by time-independent generators. We introduce a generalization valid for driven quantum systems governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that maps the evolution to a diffusion problem in a one-dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping probabilities that are inhomogeneous and time dependent. This representation is used to establish a novel class of fundamental limits to the quantum speed of evolution and operator growth. We also discuss generalizations of the algorithm, adapted to discretized time evolutions and periodic Hamiltonians, with applications to many-body systems.

Electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide to valuable fuels and chemicals on copper surfaces remains a challenging area in catalysis due to a limited understanding of adsorption mechanisms and reaction pathways. Although density functional theory (DFT) based studies have investigated these processes, their accuracy varies across different functionals. Here, we present the application of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FNDMC) to benchmark the adsorption energies of CO*, H*, and key CO reduction reaction (CORR) intermediates, COH* and CHO* on the Cu(111) surface. Our results for CO* and H* adsorption energies closely align with experimentally measured chemisorption reactions, highlighting the limitations of DFT, and providing site-specific energy comparisons that are often not available experimentally. Additionally, we explore the effect of explicit solvation, demonstrating how water stabilizes the COH* over CHO*, thus suggesting a critical role of COH* in CORR. Finally, we release our high-accuracy FNDMC benchmarks for testing and developing new DFT functionals for electrocatalysis. Overall, this study underscores the potential of FNDMC for detailed surface chemistry studies and offers new insights into catalytic processes.

We present infrared photodissociation spectra of hydrated perylene anion clusters with up to four water molecules, as well as electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory. Water molecules form weak hydrogen bonds to the  system of the perylene anion. For clusters with more than one water molecule, water-water hydrogen bonds are formed, which are generally stronger than water- hydrogen bonds. The resulting water networks exist as water subclusters on the surface of the carbon frame of perylene. We observe temperature dependent dynamic effects, which highlight large amplitude motions of the water network and the shallowness of the potential energy surfaces governing the structures of these clusters.
