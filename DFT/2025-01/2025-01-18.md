Abstract: Bilayer nickelate thin film superconductors discovered under ambient pressure enable vast possibilities for investigating electronic structures of the superconducting state. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of heterointerfaces between 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and SrLaAlO$_4$ substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced oxygen 2p hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest pathways for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.

Abstract: The macroscopic interactions of liquid iron and solid oxides, such as alumina, calcia, magnesia, silica, and zirconia manifest the behavior and efficiency of high-temperature metallurgical processes. The oxides serve dual roles, both as components of refractory materials in submerged entry nozzles and also as significant constituents of non-metallic inclusions in the melt. It is therefore crucial to understand the physicochemical interplay between the liquid and the oxides in order to address the nozzle clogging challenges, and thereby optimize cast iron and steel production. This paper presents a methodology for describing these interactions by combining the materials' dielectric responses, computed within the density functional theory, with the Casimir-Lifshitz dispersion forces to generate the Hamaker constants. The approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the wettability of iron against these refractory oxides, revealing the complex relation between molecular and macroscopic properties. Our theoretically determined crystalline structures are confirmed by room-temperature X-ray diffraction, and the contact angles of liquid iron on the oxides are validated with a sessile drop system at the temperature 1823 K. For comparison, we also present the wettability of the oxides by a liquid tin-bismuth alloy. The findings are essential in advancing the fundamental understanding of interfacial interactions in metallurgical science, and are also pivotal in driving the development of more efficient and reliable steelmaking processes.

# Singular Spectrum Analysis of Time-series Data from Time-dependent density-functional theory in Real-time

Abstract: This paper introduces a spectral analysis of time-seires data derived from real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). TDDFT is a robust method for obtaining molecular excited states and optical spectra by tracking the time evolution of dynamical dipole moments. However, the spectral resolution can be compromised when Fourier transformation's total time duration is insufficient. SSA enabled the extraction of specific oscillation components from the time-series data, facilitating the generation of higher-precision spectra. Even with relatively short time-series dataset, the predictive extension of SSA yielded high-resolution spectra, demonstrating substantial agreement with results obtained through conventional methods. The efficacy of this approach was validated for several small molecules, including ethylene, benzene, and others. SSA's ability to conduct detailed spectral anasysis in specific energy regions enhance spectral resolution and facilitates the clarification of oscillation components within these regions. Real-time TDDFT combined with SSA provides a new analytical method for analyzing the optical properties of molecules, significantly improving the accuracy of the analysis of emission and absorption spectra analysis. This method is expected to have various applications.

Abstract: Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.

# How quantum selection rules influence the magneto-optical effects of driven, ultrafast magnetization dynamics

Abstract: Ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by ultrashort pump lasers is typically explained by changes in electronic populations and scattering pathways of excited conduction electrons. This conventional approach overlooks the fundamental role of quantum mechanical selection rules, governing transitions from core states to the conduction band, that forms the key method of the probing step in these experiments. By employing fully ab initio time-dependent density functional theory, we reveal that these selection rules profoundly influence the interpretation of ultrafast spin dynamics at specific probe energies. Our analysis for hcp Co and fcc Ni at the M edge demonstrates that the transient dynamics, as revealed in pump-probe experiments, arise from a complex interplay of optical excitations of the M shell. Taking into account the selection rules and conduction electron spin flips, this leads to highly energy-dependent dynamics. These findings address longstanding discrepancies in experimental TMOKE measurements and show that only through meticulous consideration of matrix elements at the probe stage, can one ensure that magnetization dynamics is revealed in its true nature, instead of being muddled by artifacts arising from the choice of probe energy.

Abstract: The boundary of a billiard system dictates its dynamics, which can be integrable, mixed, or fully chaotic. Despite the significant implications of chaotic billiard systems with mixed curvatures, those whose boundaries feature both positive and negative curvature remain relatively under-explored. This study introduces two such billiards: a bean-shaped billiard and a peanut-shaped billiard, the latter being a variant of Cassini ovals. Unlike traditional chaotic billiards, these systems incorporate both focusing and defocusing regions along their boundaries, with no neutral segments. We examine both classical and quantum dynamics of these billiards and observe a strong alignment between the two perspectives. For classical analysis, the billiard flow diagram and billiard map reveal sensitivity to initial conditions, a hallmark of classical chaos. In the quantum domain, we use nearest-neighbour spacing distribution and spectral complexity as statistical measures to characterise chaotic behaviour. Both classical and quantum mechanical analysis are in firm agreement with each other. One of the most striking quantum phenomena we observe is the eigenfunction scarring (both scars and super-scars). Scarring phenomena serve as a rich visual manifestation of quantum and classical correspondence, and highlight quantum suppression chaos at a local level. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of chaos, especially in billiard systems with mixed curvature boundaries.

# Tailoring Spectral Response and First Hyperpolarizability of Aryl-Substituted BODIPY-based 'Push-Pull’ Chromophores: Influence of Medium and Structural Modifications

## 定制基于芳基取代的BODIPY的 “推拉” 发色团的光谱响应和第一超极化率: 介质和结构修饰的影响

**Authors:** Nabanita, Deb

The medium plays a pivotal role in dictating the extent of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in a molecule, which in turn could be useful in tuning its spectral as well as nonlinear optical (NLO) response properties. Tuning of ICT in a 𝜋-conjugated electronic donor-accepter molecule has been utlized to modulate the absorption and emission maxima as well as the first hyperpolarizability (𝛽) of the so-called ’push-pull’ chromophores. Molecules with boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-based acceptors became popular in recent years for their unique photophysical properties, ease of synthesis, and high thermal stability. In this article, we present a quantum chemical investigation of the influence of the medium on the ICT process of some novel aryl-substituted BODIPY molecules. This influence ultimately modulates their absorption, emission, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Both static and frequency-dependent 𝛽 for the second harmonic generation are investigated along with the the Pockels effect. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations using long-range corrected CAM-B3LYP functional was employed in the present study. Restricting
the rotation of the aryl ring through the incorporation of methyl groups to the BODIPY moiety enhances the fluorescence decay rate of the molecule. Both electronic and vibrational contributions to the static 𝛽 are considered. A significant increase in 𝛽 has been observed in polar solvents, compared to that in the gas phase. An interplay between structural and electronic effects was found to dictate the properties investigated. Our results sheds light on the ICT process in the studied BODIPY dyes and could be useful in tuning their spectral properties as well as formulating design principles of novel NLO materials for future technological applications.

# Isomerism and Solvent Interaction in Octamethyl Calix[4]pyrrole Complexed with Formate

**Authors:** Madison, Foreman

We investigate the binding motifs of host-guest complexes of the anion receptor octamethyl calix[4]pyrrole (omC4P) with the formate anion using cryogenic ion vibrational spectroscopy in concert with density functional theory. The resulting IR spectrum in vacuo is compared to that in deuterated acetonitrile and acetone solutions. The formate-omC4P complex has three low energy isomers in vacuo:(i) one with an oxygen atom of formate interacting with three of the NH groups of omC4P and the other oxygen atom interacting with the remaining NH group; (ii) one with a single oxygen atom of formate interacting with all four NH groups of omC4P; and (iii) one with each oxygen atom interacting with two NH groups. Each complex geometry lowers the C4v symmetry of the receptor to C1, Cs, or C2v, respectively, and this symmetry breaking and isomerism is reflected in the broadening and pattern of the NH stretching modes of omC4P.

# Extending quantum-mechanical benchmark accuracy to biological ligand-pocket interactions

## 将量子力学基准精度扩展到生物配体-口袋相互作用

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-f6615?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Alexandre, Tkatchenko

Predicting the binding affinity of ligand molecules to protein pockets is a key step in the drug design pipeline. The flexibility of ligand-pocket motifs arises from a wide range of attractive and repulsive electronic interactions invoked upon binding. Accurately accounting for all these interactions on equal footing requires robust quantum-mechanical (QM) benchmarks, which are scarce for ligand-pocket systems. In addition, the puzzling disagreement between ``gold standard'' Coupled Cluster (CCSD(T)) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods [Nat. Commun. 12, 3927 (2021)]  casts doubt on many existing benchmarks for larger non-covalent systems. Here, we introduce the ``Quantum Interacting Dimer'' (QUID) benchmark framework containing 170 non-covalent systems spanning equilibrium and non-equilibrium geometries that model chemically and structurally diverse ligand-pocket motifs. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory shows that QUID broadly covers non-covalent binding motifs and energetic (exchange-repulsion, electrostatic, induction, and dispersion) contributions. Robust and reproducible binding energies are obtained using two complementary QM methods: LNO-CCSD(T) and QMC, achieving mutual agreement of 0.3 kcal/mol. Analysis of this benchmark data reveals that several dispersion-inclusive density functional approximations provide accurate energy predictions, though they exhibit discrepancies in magnitude and orientation of atomic van der Waals forces, which could influence the dynamics of ligands within the pocket. On the contrary, semiempirical methods and widely used empirical force fields require improvements, particularly in capturing non-covalent interactions (NCIs) for out-of-equilibrium geometries. The wide span of molecular dipole moments and polarizabilities in QUID also demonstrates flexibility in designing pocket structures to achieve desired binding properties. Therefore, QUID sets a new ``platinum standard'' for reliable and reproducible QM benchmarks of NCIs in larger systems and enhances our understanding of biomolecular ligand-pocket interactions.
