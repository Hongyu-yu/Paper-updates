Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e({\bf r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}({\bf r})$ in quantum systems. A key issue is kinetic energy since $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise interaction energies. This paper presents a resolution to the problems in two steps: 1) All effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions defined at each point ${\bf r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n({\bf r})$ and are equivalent to a single-particle problem with wavefunction $s({\bf r}) = \sqrt{n({\bf r})/N}$. 2) Forms for the latter terms are proposed based on the nature of energy and stress, where energy has two distinct roles. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the appropriate density involves the terms in the hamiltonian: $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ and interactions in terms of potentials acting on the particles. This leads naturally to density functional theory with the interpretation that the energy density $e({\bf r})$ is equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential throughout the system. On the other hand, the energy and stress (derivative of the energy with respect to strain) are properties of the ground state, and simple examples to show that the only acceptable expressions involve the combination $\frac{1}{4}[|\nabla \Psi|^2 - \Psi\nabla^2 \Psi]$, as derived by Schrodinger, Pauli and others, and Coulomb interactions in the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields, not potentials. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.

Abstract: Ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by ultrashort pump lasers is typically explained by changes in electronic populations and scattering pathways of excited conduction electrons. This conventional approach overlooks the fundamental role of quantum mechanical selection rules, governing transitions from core states to the conduction band, that forms the key method of the probing step in these experiments. By employing fully ab initio time-dependent density functional theory, we reveal that these selection rules profoundly influence the interpretation of ultrafast spin dynamics at specific probe energies. Our analysis for hcp Co and fcc Ni at the M edge demonstrates that the transient dynamics, as revealed in pump-probe experiments, arise from a complex interplay of optical excitations of the M shell. Taking into account the selection rules and conduction electron spin flips, this leads to highly energy-dependent dynamics. These findings address longstanding discrepancies in experimental TMOKE measurements and show that only through meticulous consideration of matrix elements at the probe stage, can one ensure that magnetization dynamics is revealed in its true nature, instead of being muddled by artifacts arising from the choice of probe energy.

Abstract: Tunnel ionization (TI) underlies many important ultrafast processes, such as high-harmonic generation and strong-field ionization. Among the existing theories for TI, many-electron weak-field asymptotic theory (ME-WFAT) is by design capable of accurately treating many-electron effects in TI. An earlier version of ME-WFAT relied on an accurate representation of the asymptotic tail of the orbitals, which hindered its implementation in Gaussian-basis-set-based quantum chemistry programs. In this work, we reformulate ME-WFAT in the integral representation, which makes the quality of the asymptotic tail much less critical, hence greatly facilitating its implementation in standard quantum chemistry packages. The integral reformulation introduced here is therefore much more robust when applied to molecules with arbitrary geometry. We present several case studies, among which is the CO molecule where some earlier theories disagree with experiments. Here, we find that ME-WFAT produces the largest ionization probability when the field points from C to O, as experiments suggest. An attractive feature of ME-WFAT is that it can be used with various types of multielectron methods whether of density functional [Phys. Rev. A 106, 052211 (2022)] or multiconfiguration types, this in turn facilitates tunnel ionization calculation in systems exhibiting a strong multireference character.

Abstract: We present the theory and implementation of a fully variational wave function -- density functional theory (DFT) hybrid model, which is applicable to many cases of strong correlation. We denote this model the multiconfigurational self-consistent on-top pair-density functional theory model (MC-srPDFT). We have previously shown how the multi-configurational short-range DFT hybrid model (MC-srDFT) can describe many multiconfigurational cases of any spin symmetry, and also state-specific calculations on excited states (Hedeg{\aa}rd et al. J. Chem. Phys. 148, 2018, 214103). However, the srDFT part of the MC-srDFT has some deficiencies that it shares with Kohn-Sham DFT; in particular (1) self-interaction errors (albeit reduced because of the range separation), (2) that different M$_S$ states incorrectly become non-degenerate, and (3) that singlet and non-singlet states dissociating to the same open-shell fragments incorrectly lead to different electronic energies at dissociation. The model we present in this paper corrects these deficiencies by introducing the on-top pair density as an auxiliary variable replacing the spin density. Unlike other models in the literature, our model is fully variational and employs a long-range version of the on-top pair density. The implementation is a second-order optimization algorithm ensuring robust convergence to both ground- and excited states. We show how MC-srPDFT solves the mentioned challenges by sample calculations on the ground state singlet curve of H$_2$, N$_2$, and Cr$_2$ and the lowest triplet curves for N$_2$ and Cr$_2$. Furthermore, the rotational barrier for ethene is investigated for the S$_0$ and T$_1$ states. The calculations show correct degeneracy between the singlet and triplet curves at dissociation and the results are invariant to the choice of M$_S$ value for the triplet curves.

# Mechanistic Insights into Ni₅Ga₃ Thin Film Catalysts: An Ambient Pressure XPS and DFT Study

The intermetallic compound δ-Ni₅Ga₃ has emerged as a promising catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, offering low-pressure operation, high selectivity, and enhanced stability compared to conventional Cu/ZnO catalysts. However, the fundamental understanding of its active sites, reaction mechanisms, and deactivation pathways remains incomplete, hindering its further development. In this study, we utilize well-defined δ-Ni₅Ga₃ thin film model catalysts synthesized via magnetron sputtering to investigate these aspects under realistic reaction conditions. Combining in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS), μ-reactor activity testing, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal critical insights into the catalyst’s behavior. Our findings demonstrate: (1) dynamic surface evolution during activation, (2) the presence of key intermediates, such as formate, carboxyl, and methoxy species, which elucidate the methanol production pathway, and (3) catalyst deactivation at elevated temperatures. Notably, the study identifies distinct pathways for methanol synthesis and methanation, with methoxy formation correlating directly with methanol activity.
