Abstract: Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is a well-known low-bandgap photocatalyst, but its efficiency is often hindered by rapid photo-generated carrier recombination and a limited number of active catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an efficient CdS photocatalyst through a novel strategy combining metastable-to-stable phase transformation and sulfur vacancy generation. This strategy integrates hydrothermal treatment and a high-pressure process to create sulfur vacancies, which serve as active catalytic sites, within a thermodynamically stable wurtzite (hexagonal) phase known for its superior photocatalytic properties. The resulting CdS photocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in photoreforming for hydrogen production and the conversion of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into valuable materials. Compared to commercial CdS catalysts, this new material shows a 23-fold increase in both hydrogen production and plastic degradation without the need for co-catalysts. Quenching experiments reveal that holes and hydroxyl radicals play crucial roles in the photoreforming process of this vacancy-rich CdS. First-principles calculations via density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the hexagonal phase possesses a lower bandgap and it exhibits further bandgap narrowing with the introduction of sulfur vacancies. These findings not only present an innovative approach to CdS processing but also highlight the critical role of sulfur vacancies as effective defects for the catalytic photoreforming of microplastics.

Abstract: Using density functional theory, we investigate the electronic structure of the alpha phase of an antimony monolayer in its isolated form and in contact to the (111) surface of gold. We demonstrate that the isolated single-layer actually displays a slightly modulated puckering that stabilizes the monolayer, not a uniform one as often assumed. Moreover, it has dramatic consequences on the electronic band structure: the material is a semiconductor with low-dispersing bands near the Brillouin zone center. By further application of about 12% strain on the armchair direction, a double-cone features develops wherein an electronic bandgap of about 21~meV is found. When in contact with a Au(111) surface, a strong interaction with gold arises, as it appears clearly from (i) substantial atomic displacements compared to the isolated form, and (ii) hybridization of Sb and Au orbitals. The latter profoundly modifies the electronic band structure by strengthening the spin-orbit splitting of hybridized bands and spoiling the double-cone feature whose manipulation through substrate-induced strain appears therefore questionable, at least in the simulated epitaxial implementation.

Abstract: The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates opens new possibilities for investigating electronic structures in this new class of high-transition temperature $T_C$ superconductors. Here, we construct a realistic multi-orbital Hubbard model for the thin-film system, by integrating ab initio calculations with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements, which reveal a higher-symmetry lattice. The interaction parameters are calculated with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Density functional theory (DFT) plus cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) calculations, with cRPA calculated on-site Coulomb repulsive $U$ and experimentally measured electron filling $n$, quantitatively reproduces Fermi surfaces from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. The distinct Fermi surface topology from simple DFT+$U$ results features the indispensable role of correlation effects. Based upon the correlated electronic structures, A modified random-phase-approximation (RPA) approach yields a pronounced $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing instability, due to the strong spin fluctuations originated from Fermi surface nesting between bands with predominantly $d_{z^{2}}$ characters. Our findings highlight the quantitative effectiveness of the DFT+cRPA+CDMFT approach that precisely determines correlated electronic structure parameters without fine-tuning. The revealed intermediate correlation effect may explain the same order-of-magnitude onset $T_C$ observed both in pressured bulk and strained thin film bilayer nickelates.

# Review on the DFT Computation of  Bulk Heterojunction and Dye-sensitized  Organic Solar Cells Properties

**Authors:** Nathalia, Rosa

Organic solar cells (OSCs) represent a promising renewable energy technology due to their flexibility, low production cost, and environmental sustainability. To advance OSC efficiency and stability, Density Functional Theory (DFT) has emerged as a powerful computational tool, enabling the prediction and optimization of critical properties at the molecular and device levels. This review highlights the key properties of bulk heterojunction solar (BHJ) solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that can be accurately computed using DFT, including electronic structure properties (HOMO-LUMO energy levels, bandgap energies, and exciton binding energies, which influence charge separation and transport); optical properties (absorption spectra and light-harvesting efficiency, essential for maximizing photon capture); charge transport properties (reorganization energies, electron, and hole mobilities, and charge transfer rates that govern carrier dynamics within devices); interfacial properties (energy alignment at donor-acceptor interfaces, contributing to efficient charge separation and minimizing recombination) and chemical reactivity descriptors (ionization potential, electron affinity, chemical hardness, and electrophilicity, which facilitate material screening for OSC applications). We  show how to compute the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs from DFT. The review also discusses the importance of selecting appropriate exchange-correlation functionals and basis sets to ensure the accuracy of DFT predictions. By providing reliable computational insights, DFT accelerates the rational design of OSC materials, guiding experimental efforts and reducing resource demands. This work underscores DFT’s pivotal role in optimizing OSC performance, fostering the development of next-generation photovoltaic technologies.

# Unveiling the Formation Pathway of Vaterite from Amorphous Calcium Carbonate Using Metadynamics Simulations

Calcium carbonate is a compound that is widely distributed throughout the Earth as a natural mineral and a material produced by biological activities. The crystal structure of calcium carbonate has three polymorphs: the most thermodynamically stable calcite, followed by aragonite, vaterite, and amorphous \ce{CaCO3} (ACC). Of the three crystalline phases, the most unstable vaterite remains mysterious regarding its formation process and structure.  In this study, the pathway of forming the vaterite crystal structure from ACC was reproduced using well-tempered metadynamics molecular dynamics simulations. The structures sampled at multiple minima on the energy landscape were refined through first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The sampled structures were assigned space groups (SGs) and classified as calcite- and vaterite-like structures according to the arrangement of \ce{CO3^{2-}} and \ce{Ca^{2+}} sheets. The initial crystal structure produced from ACC was a monoclinic crystal with \ce{Ca^{2+}} sheets and \ce{CO3^{2-}} lying in the interlayer; however, it did not exhibit the three-fold symmetry of calcite. Calcite structures with three-fold symmetry, or orthorhombic crystals with rotated \ce{CO3^{2-}} units as found in vaterite, could be derived from this structure. The orthorhombic structure then transitioned to the more stable monoclinic form, which is likely vaterite. The understanding of phase transitions based on the diverse crystal structures of calcium carbonate revealed in this study provides a predictive view of biomineralization and carbonation reactions of cementitious materials.
