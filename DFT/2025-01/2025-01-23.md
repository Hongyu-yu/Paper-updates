# Density of States Calculation of CeO$_2$ Based on VASP

**Authors:** Ruyi Hou

Abstract: In this study, the Density of States (DOS) of CeO$_2$ was analyzed in detail using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method based on VASP software. As an important functional material, CeO$_2$ finds wide applications in catalysis, optics, and electronic devices. Through structural optimization, self-consistent electronic calculations, and non-self-consistent calculations, we thoroughly investigated the crystal structure and electronic energy level distribution of CeO$_2$. The lattice parameter optimization results from the structural calculations indicated a stable crystal structure for CeO$_2$. Self-consistent electronic calculations revealed a bandgap of approximately 2.403 eV, with the valence band maximum primarily contributed by O 2p orbitals and the conduction band minimum mainly originating from Ce 4f orbitals. Non-self-consistent calculations further demonstrated the total DOS and partial DOS of CeO$_2$, confirming the significant roles of Ce 4f and O 2p states in its electronic conduction and optical properties. These results not only provide theoretical support for the applications of CeO$_2$ in catalysis and electronic materials but also deepen our understanding of its fundamental electronic structural characteristics, offering guidance for the design and development of novel CeO$_2$-based materials.

# Is p-Type Doping in SeO2 Feasible?

Abstract: The significance of p-type transparent oxide semiconductors (TOS) in the semiconductor industry is paramount, driving advancements in optoelectronic technologies for transparent electronic devices with unique properties. The recent discovery of p-type behavior in SeO2 has stirred both interest and confusion in the scientific community. In this Letter, we employ density functional theory calculations to unveil the intrinsic insulating characteristics of SeO2, highlighting substantial challenges in carrier doping. Our electronic structure analyses indicate that the Se 5s2 states are energetically positioned too low to effectively interact with the O 2p orbitals, resulting in a valence band maximum (VBM) primarily dominated by the O 2p orbitals. The deep and localized nature of the VBM in SeO2 limits its potential as a high-mobility p-type TOS. Defect calculations demonstrate that all intrinsic defects in SeO2 exhibit deep transition levels within the bandgap. The Fermi level consistently resides in the mid-gap region, regardless of synthesis conditions. Furthermore, deep intrinsic acceptors and donors exhibit negative formation energies in the n-type and p-type regions, respectively, facilitating their spontaneous formation and impeding external doping efforts. Thus, the reported p-type conductivity in SeO2 samples is unlikely intrinsic and is more plausibly attributed to reduced elemental Se, a well-known p-type semiconductor.

Abstract: Li-CO$_2$ batteries show promise as energy storage solutions, offering high theoretical energy density and CO$_2$ fixation. Their performance relies on the formation and decomposition of Li$_2$CO$_3$/C during discharge and charge cycles, respectively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with a Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, Li$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$ concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li$_2$CO$_3$ can form toroidal and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the performance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be significantly improved by enhancing CO$_2$ transport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture.

Abstract: Cubic silicon carbide phonon thermal conductivity has been calculated using anharmonic phonon analysis. The atomic interaction model was built using displacement-force data obtained with the High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampling (HECSS) technique and density functional theory calculated forces. In the new version of HECSS we replaced the Markov chain scheme of Metropolis-Hastings Monte-Carlo with weighting of the final sampling according to the target distribution. This increased the efficiency of the method and allowed to use -- with appropriate weight -- all generated and ab-initio evaluated samples. The quality of the proposed method is confirmed by the accuracy with which the experimental results taken from the literature were reproduced.

# Development of an uncertainty-aware equation of state for gold

**Authors:** Lin H. Yang, James A. Gaffney

arXiv:2501.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a framework that employs Gaussian Processes (GPs) to develop high-fidelity equation of state (EOS) tables, essential for modeling material properties across varying temperatures and pressures. GPs offer a robust predictive modeling approach and are especially adept at handling uncertainties systematically. By integrating Error-in-Variables (EIV) into the GP model, we adeptly navigate uncertainties in both input parameters (like temperature and density) and output variables (including pressure and other thermodynamic properties). Our methodology is demonstrated using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) data for gold, observing its properties over maximum density compression (up to 100 g/cc) and extreme temperatures within the warm dense matter region (reaching 300 eV). Furthermore, we assess the resilience of our uncertainty propagation within the resultant EOS tables under various conditions, including data scarcity and the intrinsic noise of experiments and simulations.

# Freezing in flat monolayers of soft spherocylinders

Abstract: Lamellar or smectic phases often have an intricate intralamellar structure that remains scarcely understood from a microscopic viewpoint. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of volume exclusion and electrostatic repulsion on the phase transitions of a flat membrane of soft spherocylinders. With increasing rod packing, we identify nematic and solid phases and find that the nematic-crystal phase transition happens at a uniform packing fraction ($\eta_c \approx 0.82$), independent of the spherocylinder aspect ratio. This value is considerably higher than the well-known critical freezing transition of a hard disk fluid ($\eta_c \approx 0.7$) to which one could naively map a system of near-parallel rods with co-planar mass centers. We attribute this difference to a non-vanishing residual orientational entropy per rod. Our findings are corroborated by a simple theory based on a simple microscopic density functional theory of freezing of a two-dimensional rod fluid. Introduction of electrostatic interactions between the rods reduces the lateral compressibility of the monolayer fluid but keeps the positional order unhindered, which in turn maintains the packing fraction at the nematic-crystal transition. The strength of the orientational fluctuations of the individual rods in our membranes exhibits a density scaling that differs from 3D bulk smectics. Our findings contribute to a qualitative understanding of liquid crystal phase stability in strong planar confinement and engage with recent experimental explorations involving nanorods on 2D substrates.

# Hybrid Gauge Approach for Accurate Real-Time TDDFT Simulations with Numerical Atomic Orbitals

## 具有数值原子轨道的精确实时TDDFT模拟的混合规范方法

**Authors:** Haotian Zhao, Lixin He

arXiv:2501.11961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast real-time dynamics are critical for understanding a broad range of physical processes. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) has emerged as a powerful computational tool for simulating these dynamics, offering insight into untrafast processes and light-matter interactions. In periodic systems, the velocity gauge is essential because it preserves the system's periodicity under an external electric field. Numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs) are widely employed in rt-TDDFT codes due to their efficiency and localized nature. However, directly applying the velocity gauge within the NAO basis set neglects the position-dependent phase variations within atomic orbitals induced by the vector potential, leading to significant computational errors-particularly in current calculations. To resolve this issue, we develop a hybrid gauge that incorporates both the electric field and the vector potential, preserving the essential phase information in atomic orbitals and thereby eliminating these errors. Our benchmark results demonstrate that the hybrid gauge fully resolves the issues encountered with the velocity gauge in NAO-based calculations, providing accurate and reliable results. This algorithm offers a robust framework for future studies on ultrafast dynamics in periodic systems using NAO bases.

Abstract: Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. Exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an exact formula for the phonon linewidths involving only dressed electron-phonon couplings and ensuring the positivity property. The formula is designed to account for both nonadiabatic and correlation effects, and it provides an alternative proof that Density Functional Perturbation Theory calculations of phonon linewidths are not affected by a double counting of screening diagrams. Furthermore, we extend the treatment to nonequilibrium scenarios and offer a rigorous justification for employing the phononic Boltzmann equation.

Abstract: Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB), an approximative approach derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT), has the potential to pave the way for simulations of large periodic or non-periodic systems. We have specifically tailored DFTB parameters to enhance the accuracy of electronic band gap calculations in both 3D and 2D lead-iodide perovskites, at a significantly reduced computational cost relative to state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. Our electronic DFTB parameters allow computing not only the band gap but also effective masses of perovskite materials with reasonable accuracy compared to existing experimental data and state-of-the-art DFT calculations. The electronic band structures of vacancy-ordered and, lead- and iodide- deficient perovskites are also explored. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of DFTB in computing electronic band alignments in perovskite heterostructures. The DFTB-based approach is anticipated to be beneficial for studying large-scale systems such as heterostructures and nanocrystals.

Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.

Abstract: Orbital-optimized density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as an alternative to time-dependent (TD) DFT capable of describing difficult excited states with significant electron density redistribution, such as charge-transfer, Rydberg, and double-electron excitations. Here, a simple method is developed to solve the main problem of the excited-state optimization -- the variational collapse of the excited states onto the ground state. In this method, called variable-metric time-independent DFT (VM TIDFT), the electronic states are allowed to be nonorthogonal during the optimization but their orthogonality is gradually enforced with a continuous penalty function. With nonorthogonal electronic states, VM TIDFT can use molecular orbital coefficients as independent variables, which results in a closed-form analytical expression for the gradient and allows to employ any of the multiple unconstrained optimization algorithms that guarantees convergence of the excited-state optimization. Numerical tests on multiple molecular systems show that the variable-metric optimization of excited states performed with a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm is robust and produces accurate energies for well-behaved excitations and, unlike TDDFT, for more challenging charge-transfer and double-electron excitations.

Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is crucial for optimizing the performance and stability of lithium-ion batteries. Novel solvents are essential for enhancing electrolyte structure and ensuring better integration with modern electrode systems. However, there are limited studies focused on fluorinated solvent-based electrolytes. Herein, we report a new weakly solvated ether electrolyte (WSEE) composed of a pure fluorinated ether solvent, which results in an anion-rich solvation structure even at a low salt concentration of 1M. To explore this, we selected the advanced fluorinated solvent 2,2-Difluoroethyl Methyl Ether (FEME) and compared it with Dipropyl Ether (DPE), Ethylene Carbonate (EC), and Diethyl Carbonate (DEC). The prepared electrolyte systems include DPE with 1M, 1.8M, and 4M LiFSI, FEME with 1M, 1.8M, and 4M LiFSI, and a 1:1 vol% EC/DEC mixture containing 1M LiPF6. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the Li+ solvation structures in these electrolytes using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Our computational findings indicate the presence of large ion aggregates (AGGs) in each DPE- and FEME-based electrolyte, while SSIPs (68%) are the dominant species in the mixed EC/DEC electrolyte. Notably, the formation of large ion aggregates is more pronounced in FEME-based electrolytes. We find that, similar to DPE, FEME solvent also exhibits weak solvating power across all examined salt concentrations. Furthermore, the quantum mechanical features of the Li+ solvation structures in DPE+1.8M LiFSI, FEME+1.8M LiFSI, and EC/DEC+1M LiPF6 electrolytes have been analyzed in detail using DFT calculations. We anticipate that this study will provide valuable insights into the Li+ solvation structures in DPE, FEME, and EC/DEC electrolytes, where the ether-based electrolytes exhibit closely similar properties.

# Photochemistry of Hypervalent Iodo-azide Derivatives

## 高价碘叠氮衍生物的光化学

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-nl8ww?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Joseph, O'Shea

The photochemical properties and reaction mechanisms were studied for a series of hypervalent iodo-azide compounds (R-IN₃), with substituents (-CH₃, -H, -CF₃) modulating electronic density in the phenyl ring. With the help of UV irradiation, ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the mechanisms of azide radical (N₃•) release and its subsequent reactivity. UV/Vis spectroscopy reveals that the photo-conversion rates follow the trend CH₃ > H > CF₃, aligning with DFT-calculated ΔG values for ring-opening transitions. Homolytic cleavage of the I-N bond is identified as the dominant pathway for N₃• generation, occurring within 400 ps. The released azide radical reacts with the solvent, and the iodo radical RIC• undergoes an uphill ring opening reaction controlling the rate of the reaction and subsequent downhill hydrogen atom abstraction from the solvent, helping to form R-I-COOH, as validated by NMR and IR spectroscopy. The study also highlights the role of substituents in influencing reaction kinetics and intermediate stability, with electron-donating groups accelerating N₃• release. This work bridges experimental observations with computational predictions, offering a foundation for future advancements in azide-based reactions and materials.

# Anomalous CO Saturation at 26% on Cu(111) Governed by Long-range Collective Quantum Compression

## 受远程集体量子压缩控制的Cu(111) 上26% 的异常CO饱和度

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5738188/latest

CO adsorption on transition metal surfaces has been extensively studied for over a century. However, the challenge known as the CO puzzle persists due to the failure of density functional theory and a lack of extensive high-quality experimental data. This study investigates CO adsorption on Cu(111) using statistical analysis of atomic-resolution images. We observe a counterintuitive conservation of surface CO coverage, which remains constant at 26%, significantly lower than the theoretical maximum, regardless of patterns and temperature. We attribute this anomaly to surface-mediated collective quantum compression, which refers to enhanced localization of surface electrons as CO coverage increases, weakening the Cu-CO binding strength. We determine the effective radius of these long-range interactions as 5.3 nm, far exceeding the spatial range of direct C-Cu interactions. Our work provides new insights into the CO puzzle, advancing the understanding of adsorption phenomena and offering implications for surface chemistry and interfacial science.
