Author(s): Melih Gül, Roland Roth, and Robert Evans<br /><p>Classical density functional theory, which describes the properties of classical many-particle systems, requires the use of suitable approximations. The authors introduce two statistical mechanical sum rules as constraints for making these approximations. They find that this approach improves upon certain earlier calculations, and could lead to more accurate predictions in general.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRE/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.064115.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

Abstract: Wide bandgap semiconductors (WBGs) are predicted to be the potential materials for energy generation and storing. In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) that incorporates generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and meta-generalized gradient approximation (mGGA) methods to explore the various properties of the LiSnCl3 and LiSnBr3 perovskites. The structural stabilities, charge transfer, electronic, optical, mechanical, and piezoelectric properties are studied. Herein, we report that these rarely studied materials are eco-friendly and look promising for optoelectronics and piezoelectric applications.

Abstract: Pb-based perovskites are considered to be the most efficient materials for energy harvest. However, real-time application is limited because of their toxicity. As a result, lead-free perovskites that offer similar advantages are potential alternatives. Here, we have chosen LiSnX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, and I) for further calculation and explore its possibilities for harvesting clean and green energy. Our objective is to examine strategies for optimizing the parameters that control the energy-harvesting capabilities, particularly the interplay between structural variations and electrical properties. The density functional theory (DFT) has been employed for the theoretical simulation. Within the DFT framework, we have studied the effect of applied pressure (0 to 20 GPa) and elemental substitution on their physical properties. We hereby report the variation of lattice parameters, elastic constants, band gaps, and piezoelectric constants. MD simulation with time steps of up to 5 ps was performed to verify structural stability at room temperature. We report the semi-conducting characteristic of LiSnX$_3$ and the high piezoelectric response up to 20.7 Cm2. The presence of high piezoelectric coefficients suggests that manipulation of the structure of LiSnX$_3$ may provide an alternative way to harvest energy through electromechanical processes.

# Thermodynamic favourability of 1T phase over 1H phase in group III metal monochalcogenide zigzag nanoribbons

Abstract: Owing to the promising optoelectric and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. To date, existing research in literature has predominantly focused on the most stable 1H phase 2D MXs and their armchair edge NRs, since the zigzag edge NRs (ZNRs) of this phase show metallic behavior. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically favorable at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican hat-shaped top valence band without any built-in potential between the edges. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the localized state, the unpassivated case possesses a nearly flat top valence band. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.

# Topology of Monitored Quantum Dynamics

## 被监控的量子动力学拓扑

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06133

arXiv:2412.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces a variety of open quantum phenomena that have no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators within the 38-fold way, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as anomalous boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, constituting the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics.

arXiv:2412.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interatomic bonding and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for preparing high-performance 2D semiconductor materials. We have calculated the band structure, electronic properties, and bonding characteristics of SnO in 2D materials by using density functional theory (DFT) and combining bond energy and bond charge models. Atomic bonding analysis enables us to deeply and meticulously analyze the interatomic bonding and charge transfer in the layered structure of SnO. This study greatly enhances our understanding of the local bonding state on the surface of 2D structural materials. In addition, we use the renormalization method to operate energy to determine the wave function at different quantum resolutions. This is of great significance for describing the size and phase transition of nanomaterials.

Abstract: Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next-generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor-made solid-state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles, and techniques such as co-crystallisation, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterised by methods such as X-Ray Diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here we present our database of small molecular crystals, and their Density Functional Theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring longitudinal d33 constant. This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.

Abstract: In the present work, the ideal shear strength ({\tau}_is) of dilute Ni34XZ ternary alloys (X or Z = Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Si, Ti) are predicted by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) in terms of pure alias shear deformations. The {\tau}_is results show that within the concentration up to 8.3% of alloying elements, {\tau}_is increases with composition in binary systems with Mn, Fe, and Co in ascending order, and decreases with composition with Nb, Si, Mo, Ti, Al, and Cr in descending order. The composition dependence of {\tau}_is in binary and ternary systems is modeled using the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach considering lattice instability, indicating that atomic bonding strength significantly influences {\tau}_is. Correlational analyses further show that lattice constant and elastic constant C11 affect {\tau}_is, the most out of the elemental features.

# Hilbert-Space Ergodicity in Driven Quantum Systems: Obstructions and Designs

arXiv:2402.06720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its long history, a canonical formulation of quantum ergodicity that applies to general classes of quantum dynamics, including driven systems, has not been fully established. Here we introduce and study a notion of quantum ergodicity for closed systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians, defined as statistical randomness exhibited in their longtime dynamics. Concretely, we consider the temporal ensemble of quantum states (time-evolution operators) generated by the evolution, and investigate the conditions necessary for them to be statistically indistinguishable from uniformly random states (operators) in the Hilbert space (space of unitaries). We find that the number of driving frequencies underlying the Hamiltonian needs to be sufficiently large for this to occur. Conversely, we show that statistical pseudo-randomness -- indistinguishability up to some large but finite moment, can already be achieved by a quantum system driven with a single frequency, i.e., a Floquet system, as long as the driving period is sufficiently long. Our work relates the complexity of a time-dependent Hamiltonian and that of the resulting quantum dynamics, and offers a fresh perspective to the established topics of quantum ergodicity and chaos from the lens of quantum information.

# Quantum effects of Coulomb explosion simulations revealed by time-dependent density-functional theory

## 随时间变化的密度泛函理论揭示库仑爆炸模拟的量子效应

arXiv:2412.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of quantum effects on Coulomb explosion dynamics using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations, comparing classical, semi-classical, and quantum approaches. The goal is to elucidate how electron dynamics affect the kinetic energy, angular distribution, and final velocities of ejected ions. The results indicate that quantum effects result in lower kinetic energies all ions, deviating from classical predictions. Furthermore, quantum simulations exhibit broader angular distributions and more diverse ion trajectories, aligning closely with experimental observations. The research also highlights the role of laser intensity and the resultant ionization in enhancing quantum effects, particularly in modifying ion velocities and distributions. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the role of electron dynamics in Coulomb explosions, offering valuable insights for both experimental and theoretical studies of molecular fragmentation.

# Consciousness-Centered Ontology of Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD)

## 以意识为中心的关系量子动力学本体论 (RQD)

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05979

arXiv:2412.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD), a paradigm that re-envisions quantum theory and its interplay with spacetime, observers, and consciousness. Abandoning the notion of a preexisting universe or fixed manifold, RQD posits that observers, observed systems, and geometric structures emerge together as stable relational patterns in an underlying quantum substrate. Spacetime is thus recast as an effective, large-scale feature of entanglement and information flows rather than a fundamental stage. By eliminating pre-given observers and absolute properties, RQD unifies relational quantum mechanics, insights from holography and tensor networks, and non-dual philosophical traditions into a single idealist framework. Here, universal awareness is not an added element but the ontological ground, ensuring that subjective experience and physical reality co-derive from the same relational field. This approach not only demystifies the "hard problem" of consciousness, making it intrinsic rather than emergent but also resolves longstanding quantum puzzles, such as Wigner's friend and Frauchiger-Renner scenarios, by showing that no absolute vantage point or objective collapse is required. In harmonizing quantum theory, emergent geometry, and a fundamental awareness-based ontology, RQD reveals that quantum mechanics, gravity, and consciousness are facets of a single, integrated reality.

# Designing Electrocatalytic Mediators and Understanding Site-selectivity for C(sp3)-H Activation Using First-Principles Calculations

## 使用第一性原理计算设计电催化介体并了解C(sp3)-H活化的位点选择性

Selective C-H bond activation is one of the most critical molecular transformations in synthesizing chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and natural product intermediates with broad applications. Recent efforts have focused on developing electrocatalytic mediators that rapidly and selectively activate specific C-H bonds. These mediated activations offer multiple benefits over direct electrochemical oxidation as they can occur at lower overpotentials, leading to higher faradaic efficiency and selectivity with reduced solvent oxidation. Our previous work described the development of N-alkyl ammonium ylides as a new class of electro-oxidative mediators. Despite its importance, the underlying principles of designing efficient mediators and understanding their site-selectivity are yet to be fully elucidated. The work discussed herein scrutinized mediator design using density functional theory calculations to highlight the critical features of mediators that govern C(sp3)-H activation. The design of newer mediators is guided by scaling relationships between the thermodynamic descriptors associated with the elementary steps involved in C(sp3)-H activation. We subsequently examine the results from detailed transition state calculations to elucidate the site-selectivity for C(sp3)-H activation for various substrates with quinuclidine and ylide mediators. The results show the critical interplay of thermodynamic, steric, and electronic features of the substrate and mediator that govern the corresponding site-selectivity. Finally, we present unifying trends across multiple substrates and mediators to understand the site-selectivity for mediated electrocatalytic C(sp3)-H activations and push our efforts toward predicting regio-selectivity in the future.

# Aluminum Photosensitizers with Long-lived Triplet States on Trial: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, Photophysical and Photobiological Properties of Tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) Complexes

Metal coordination compounds are currently a focus of research in developing new photosensitizers for materials and medicinal applications. As an abundant element in the earth’s crust aluminum is a suitable target element. However, only limited studies are available on its use in photoactive systems. We now report the facile preparation of a library of homoleptic tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) [AL(DIPY)3] complexes. The majority of complexes was characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis and their photophysical properties upon photoexcitation and their tendency to react with the molecular oxygen of the microenvironment and generate singlet oxygen - in polar and non-polar environment was investigated. These studies are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess the possible electronic distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals within the complexes. As a result of charge transfer states, long-lived triplet excited states were formed and allowed for singlet oxygen generation. An initial screening of the AL(DIPY)3 complexes via in vitro phototoxicity studies against a mouse colon carcinoma cell line (CT26) was promising as these complexes were able to trigger cell death upon irradiation at safe nanomolar and micromolar concentrations. The results highlight the potential of aluminum dipyrrin complexes as a broadly applicable class of photosensitizers.

# Understanding and optimizing Li substitution in P2-type Sodium Layered Oxides for Sodium-Ion Batteries

## 钠离子电池P2-type钠层状氧化物中Li取代的理解和优化

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-7x9sm?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

In the quest for novel cathode materials for Na-ion batteries, we studied a family of Li-substituted P2 layered oxides with nominal stoichiometry Na5/6LiyNi5/12-3y/2Mn7/12+y/2O2 (y = 2/18, 3/18, 4/18, 5/18). We explored the consequences of Li substitution, as well as the challenge of elevating the Na content in the pristine materials through solid-state synthesis. By in situ temperature-resolved x-ray diffraction (XRD) we observed the synthesis process, clearly showing the formation of an intermediate Li2MnO3 structure with increasing Li content. Structurally, honeycomb ordering is observed in all samples, while we show that Li induces the loss of Na+/vacancy ordering hence it leads to more disordered Na positions. Electrochemically, this family of materials exhibits an increasing trend of polarized hysteresis in the first cycle, suggesting the contribution of oxygen redox. We coupled semi-simultaneous operando x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and XRD to appreciate the structural evolution and redox behavior during this process. We verified that Li in the transition metal site eliminates phase transitions at high voltage and modifies the activation of O-redox. As confirmed by our XANES analysis and by Density Functional Theory calculations, the Li-free sample already surprisingly show anionic redox despite the residual availability of Ni-redox, due to the peculiar density of states dominated by Ni-O hybridized states at high state of charge. On the other hand, Li-containing samples have O non-bonding states that lead to increasing O-redox contribution as expected due to the limited Ni content. One composition (Na0.745(6)Li0.164(4)Ni0.238(1)Mn0.599(3)O2) proves to have the lowest proportion of O-redox among all samples, coupled with reduced phase transitions, disordered occupancy of Na sites, and small volume change during cycling (4.8%). This material hence delivers the best balance of cycling stability (∼92% after 100 cycles in half cells), capacity (> 100 mAh/g) and rate capability. Determining this optimal compositional range is a promising starting point for further development of P2 layered oxides as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries and can be generalized to other families of Na-based layered oxides with redox-inactive dopants.

The excited-state properties of molecular crystals are important for applications in organic electronic devices. The GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW +BSE) is the state-of-the-art method for calculating the excited-state properties of crystalline solids with periodic boundary conditions. We present the PAH101 dataset of GW +BSE calculations for 101 molecular crystals of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with up to ∼500 atoms in the unit cell. The data records include the GW quasiparticle band structure, the fundamental band gap, the static dielectric constant, the first singlet exciton energy (optical gap), the first triplet exciton energy, the dielectric function, and optical absorption spectra for light polarized along the three lattice vectors. In addition, the dataset includes the density functional theory (DFT) single-molecule and crystal features used in Liu et al. [npj Computational Materials, 8, 70 (2022)]. We envision the dataset being used to (i) identify correlations between DFT and GW +BSE quantities, (ii) discover materials with desired electronic/ optical properties in the dataset itself, and (iii) train machine-learned models to help in materials discovery efforts. We provide examples to illustrate these three use cases.
