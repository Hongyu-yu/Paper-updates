Abstract: In the laser processing of glass, a ~50-1000 $\mu$m-thick layer of glass is heated to a high temperature by the laser beam. Due to the shallow depth of this hot layer, the infrared emission and absorption spectra may deviate from the black-body spectra and can be influenced by the vibrational structure of the material. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) modeling of the thermal radiation by such hot layers allows us to calculate the emissivity and thus to evaluate the reliability of the measurements conducted with thermal cameras at specific wavelengths.

Abstract: Photoluminescent defects in diamond, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center, are at the forefront of emerging optical quantum technologies. Most emit in the visible and near-infrared spectral region below 1000 nm (NIR-I), limiting their applications in photonics, fiber communications, and biology. Here, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy-nitrogen ($N_2V$) center, which emits in the visible and near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is ubiquitous in as-synthesized and processed nitrogen-doped diamond from bulk samples to nanoparticles. We demonstrate that $N_2V$ is also present in commercially available state-of-the-art NV diamond sensing chips made via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of both $N_2V$ charge states, $N_2V^0$ in the visible and $N_2V^-$ in the NIR-II, increases with increasing substitutional nitrogen concentration. We determine the PL lifetime of $N_2V^-$ to be 0.3 ns and compare a quantum optical and density functional theory model of the $N_2V^-$ with experimental PL spectra. Finally, we show that detonation nanodiamonds (DND) show stable PL in the NIR-II, which we attribute to the $N_2V$ color center, and use this NIR-II PL to image DNDs inside skin cells. Our results will contribute to the scientific and technological exploration and development of the $N_2V$ color center and inspire more research into its effect on other color centers in diamond.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a renormalization group perspective on the quantum dynamics of a particle moving in the Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^N$ space through the complex landscape provided by a disordered Hamiltonian of type $2+p$. We focus on the large $N$ limit, where the coarse-graining procedure is unconventional: it is based on the Wigner spectrum of the rank-2 disorder. The main consequence of this choice is that canonical dimensions depend on the scale, and the flow equations fail to become autonomous, preventing the existence of global fixed points. One of the main features of the underlying renormalization group flow is the existence of finite-scale singularities for initial conditions sufficiently close to the Gaussian region and for rank-$p$ disorder intensity large enough. Using the Luttinger-Ward formalism, we show that these finite-scale singularities hide (and should be resolved by) a phase transition that breaks time-translation invariance.

Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a physically motivated loss function that enforces the Schr\"odinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure effectively captures the relevant dynamical frequencies in the time evolution and is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics. We showcase the method's effectiveness by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D. By extracting the asymptotic long-time evolution, we uncover signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, the method presented here shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches and highlight the potential to explore previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.

Abstract: We study the entanglement properties in non-equilibrium quantum systems with the SU(1, 1) structure. Through M\"obius transformation, we map the dynamics of these systems following a sudden quench or a periodic drive onto three distinct trajectories on the Poincar\'e disc, corresponding the heating, non-heating, and a phase boundary describing these non-equilibrium quantum states. We consider two experimentally feasible systems where their quantum dynamics exhibit the SU(1, 1) structure: the quench dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensates and the periodically driven coupled oscillators. In both cases, the heating, non-heating phases, and their boundary manifest through distinct signatures in the phonon population where exponential, oscillatory, and linear growths classify these phases. Similarly, the entanglement entropy and negativity also exhibit distinct behaviors (linearly, oscillatory, and logarithmic growths) characterizing these phases, respectively. Notibly, for the periodically driven coupled oscillators, the non-equilibrium properties are characterized by two sets of SU(1, 1) generators. The corresponding two sets of the trajectories on two Poincar\'e discs lead to a more complex phase diagram. We identify two distinct phases within the heating region discernible solely by the growth rate of the entanglement entropy, where a discontinuity is observed when varying the parameters across the phase boundary within in heating region. This discontinuity is not observed in the phonon population.

Abstract: We present an efficient linear-scaling algorithm for evaluating the analytical force and stress contributions derived from the exact-exchange energy, a key component in hybrid functional calculations. The algorithm, working equally well for molecular and periodic systems, is formulated within the framework of numerical atomic orbital (NAO) basis sets and takes advantage of the localized resolution-of-identity (LRI) technique for treating the two-electron Coulomb repulsion integrals. The linear-scaling behavior is realized by fully exploiting the sparsity of the expansion coefficients resulting from the strict locality of the NAOs and the LRI ansatz. Our implementation is massively parallel, and enables efficient structural relaxation based on hybrid density functionals for bulk materials containing thousands of atoms. In this work, we will present a detailed description of our algorithm and benchmark the performance of our implementation using illustrating examples. By optimizing the structures of the pristine and doped halide perovskite material CsSnI$_3$ with different functionals, we find that in the presence of lattice strain, hybrid functionals provide a more accurate description of the stereochemical expression of the lone pair.

Abstract: We introduce a technique for calculation the density operator time evolution along the lines of Heisenberg representation of quantum mechanics. Using this technique, we find the exact solution for the evolution of two and three coupled harmonic oscillators initially prepared in thermal states at different temperatures. We show that such systems exhibit interesting quantum dynamics in which oscillators swap their thermal states due to entanglement induced in the process of energy exchange and yield noise induced coherence. A photonic quantum heat engine (QHE) composed of two optical cavities can be modeled as coupled harmonic oscillators with time-dependent frequencies. Photons in the cavities become entangled during the engine operation. We show that the work done by such an engine is maximum if at the end of the cycle the oscillators swap numbers of excitations which can be achieved when the engine operates under the condition of parametric resonance. We also show that Carnot formula yields limiting efficiency for QHEs under general assumptions. Our results deepen understanding of quantum evolution of mixed states which could be useful to design quantum machines with a better performance.

**Authors:** Zongping, Shao

Achieving a carbon-neutral society requires strategies that seamlessly integrate environmental sustainability with economic viability. Solid oxide electrochemical reactors (SOERs) hold the potential to concurrently recycle CO2 while synthesizing high-value propylene from low-cost gases using surplus renewable electricity. However, existing SOER designs face significant challenges in slow reaction kinetics and instability. We present evidence that Fe-Ni-Ru alloy@FeOx core-shell nanoparticles on the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.4Ni0.05Ru0.05O6-δ electrode of SOER substantially enhance electrochemical CO2 reduction at the cathode, and propane conversion to propylene and ethylene at the anode through the promotion of active oxygen species at the surfaces. The formation of core-shell nanoparticles lowers the activation energy of polarization resistance from 2.1 eV to 0.82 eV, facilitating high current densities and 150 h of stable SOER operation with an 80% selectivity for propylene and ethylene production. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this enhancement is due to the reduced activation energy for dissociative CO2 reduction on the surface of Fe-Ni-Ru alloy@FeOx core-shell nanoparticles. These results show the potential of the self-organized core-shell nanoparticles in SOERs for economical CO2 recycling, offering a promising approach in the pursuit of a carbon-neutral future.

# Adapted DFTB3 repulsive potentials reach DFT accuracy for hydride transfer reactions in enzymes

**Authors:** Esteban , Vöhringer-Martinez

Enzymatic hydride transfer reactions play a crucial role in numerous metabolic pathways, yet their accurate computational modeling remains challenging due to the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. Ideally, molecular dynamics simulations should sample all enzyme configurations along the reaction path using post Hartree-Fock or DFT QM/MM electrostatic embedding methods, but these are computationally expensive. Here, we introduce a simple approach to improve the third-order density functional tight binding (DFTB3) semi-empirical method to model hydride transfer reactions in enzymes. We identified deficiencies in DFTB3's description of the potential energy surface for the hydride transfer step in Crotonyl-CoA Carboxylase/Reductase (Ccr) and developed a systematic methodology to address these limitations. Our approach involves modifying DFTB3's repulsive potential functions using linear combinations of harmonic functions, guided by analysis of C-H and C-C distance distributions along the reaction path. The optimized DFTB3 Hamiltonian significantly improved the description of the hydride transfer reaction in Ccr, reproducing the reference DFT activation barrier within 0.1 kcal/mol. We also addressed the transferability of our method by applying it to another hydride transfer reaction bearing the 1,4-dihydropyridine motif but exhibiting distinct structural features of the reactant, as well as the hydride transfer reaction in Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR). In both cases our adapted DFTB3 Hamiltonian correctly reproduced the DFT reference and experimentally observed activation barriers. The low computational cost and transferability of our method will enable more accurate and efficient QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations of hydride transfer reactions, potentially accelerating research in enzyme engineering and drug design.

# The Effect of Alkyl Termination on the Optical and Electronic Properties of Silicon Nanoparticles

## 烷基封端对硅纳米粒子光学和电子性质的影响

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-5qznh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Eimear , Madden

In this study, we use a combination of (time-dependent) density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory methods to study the impact of alkyl termination on the optical and electronic properties of silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs), as well as the effect of increasing particle size. A comparative study of hydrogen and methyl-terminated SiNPs reveals that replacing hydrogen atoms with methyl groups results in a reduction of the fundamental gap, optical gap, and exciton binding energy. The effect of replacing hydrogen by methyl diminishes with increasing size of the silicon core of the particles, which can be attributed to the decreasing surface-to-volume ratio. Larger hydrogen-terminated SiNPs, therefore, serve as increasingly accurate models for alkyl-terminated SiNPs. The size of the lowest energy excited-state, exciton, increases when replacing (more of the) hydrogen atoms with methyl groups for a given silicon core size, suggesting that the exciton delocalises onto the methyl groups. Analysis of the relevant natural transition orbitals confirms that both the excited electron and hole components of the exciton partially delocalise on to the methyl groups, with increased delocalisation in the case of the excited electron. The reduced fundamental and optical gaps and exciton binding energy in methyl-terminated SiNPs, and probably by extension alkyl terminated SiNPS in general, are likely due to the electron-donating nature of methyl groups combined with exciton delocalisation.

# Cage Alkyl Carbenes Provide Experimental Evidence for Isotope-Controlled Selectivity

**Authors:** Marija, Alešković

We report the gas-phase synthesis and reactivity of adamantylidene and pentacyclo[5.4.0.02.6.03.10.05.9]undecanylidene.  The latter, a previously unreported carbene, represents only the second alkyl carbene spectroscopically characterized to date.  The singlet carbenes were generated through irradiation of their corresponding diazirine precursors followed by trapping the products in argon or nitrogen matrices at 3.5 K.  Analyses using IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy, together with density functional theory computations provide strong evidence for the successful preparation of these reactive species. Adamantylidene (∆EST = –3.0 kcal mol–1) undergoes a slow hitherto unreported but theoretically predicted quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) C–H-bond insertion and ring-closure to 2,4-dehydroadamantane.  In contrast, pentacyclo[5.4.0.02.6.03.10.05.9]undecanylidene (∆EST = –5.2 kcal mol–1) remains unchanged under cryogenic conditions but rearranges to homohypostrophene upon = 627 nm irradiation.  Attempts to prepare protoadamantylidene (∆EST = –5.1 kcal mol–1) in a similar fashion did not allow the direct observation of the free carbene, but enabled follow-up QMT reactions, whose selectivities are determined by the 1H and 2H isotopologs, thereby demonstrating isotope-controlled selectivity (ICS).
