Author(s): Melih Gül, Roland Roth, and Robert Evans<br /><p>Classical density functional theory, which describes the properties of classical many-particle systems, requires the use of suitable approximations. The authors introduce two statistical mechanical sum rules as constraints for making these approximations. They find that this approach improves upon certain earlier calculations, and could lead to more accurate predictions in general.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRE/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.064115.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

# Revisiting Thomson’s model with multiply charged superfluid helium nanodroplets

## 用多电荷超流体氦纳米液滴重新审视汤姆森模型

<span class="paragraphSection">We study superfluid helium droplets multiply charged with Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>+</sup> ions. When stable, the charges are found to reside in equilibrium close to the droplet surface, thus representing a physical realization of Thomson’s model. We find the minimum radius of the helium droplet that can host a given number of ions using a model whose physical ingredients are the solvation energy of the cations, calculated within the helium density functional theory approach, and their mutual Coulomb repulsion energy. Our model goes beyond the often used liquid drop model, where charges are smeared out either within the droplet or on its surface, and which neglects the solid-like helium shell around the ions. We find that below a threshold droplet radius <span style="font-style: italic;">R</span><sub>0</sub>, the total energy of the system becomes higher than that of the separated system of the pristine helium droplet and the charges embedded in their solvation microcluster (“snowball”). However, the ions are still kept within the droplet by the presence of energy barriers, which hinder Coulomb explosion. A further reduction of the droplet radius below a value <span style="font-style: italic;">R</span><sub><span style="font-style: italic;">expl</span></sub> eventually results in the disappearance of such barrier, leading to Coulomb explosion. Surprisingly, our results are rather insensitive to the ion atomic species. This makes room to discuss them in the context of intrinsic multicharged helium droplets, where the charges are triatomic He3+ ions. Our calculated values for <span style="font-style: italic;">R</span><sub><span style="font-style: italic;">expl</span></sub> display the correct scaling with the number of cations compared to the available experimental results, at variance with other estimates for the critical radii.</span>

**Authors:** Matthew, Neurock

Selective C-H bond activation is one of the most critical molecular transformations in synthesizing chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and natural product intermediates with broad applications. Recent efforts have focused on developing electrocatalytic mediators that rapidly and selectively activate specific C-H bonds. These mediated activations offer multiple benefits over direct electrochemical oxidation as they can occur at lower overpotentials, leading to higher faradaic efficiency and selectivity with reduced solvent oxidation. Our previous work described the development of N-alkyl ammonium ylides as a new class of electro-oxidative mediators. Despite its importance, the underlying principles of designing efficient mediators and understanding their site-selectivity are yet to be fully elucidated. The work discussed herein scrutinized mediator design using density functional theory calculations to highlight the critical features of mediators that govern C(sp3)-H activation. The design of newer mediators is guided by scaling relationships between the thermodynamic descriptors associated with the elementary steps involved in C(sp3)-H activation. We subsequently examine the results from detailed transition state calculations to elucidate the site-selectivity for C(sp3)-H activation for various substrates with quinuclidine and ylide mediators. The results show the critical interplay of thermodynamic, steric, and electronic features of the substrate and mediator that govern the corresponding site-selectivity. Finally, we present unifying trends across multiple substrates and mediators to understand the site-selectivity for mediated electrocatalytic C(sp3)-H activations and push our efforts toward predicting regio-selectivity in the future.

# Aluminum Photosensitizers with Long-lived Triplet States on Trial: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, Photophysical and Photobiological Properties of Tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) Complexes

**Authors:** René M., Williams

Metal coordination compounds are currently a focus of research in developing new photosensitizers for materials and medicinal applications. As an abundant element in the earth’s crust aluminum is a suitable target element. However, only limited studies are available on its use in photoactive systems. We now report the facile preparation of a library of homoleptic tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) [AL(DIPY)3] complexes. The majority of complexes was characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis and their photophysical properties upon photoexcitation and their tendency to react with the molecular oxygen of the microenvironment and generate singlet oxygen - in polar and non-polar environment was investigated. These studies are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess the possible electronic distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals within the complexes. As a result of charge transfer states, long-lived triplet excited states were formed and allowed for singlet oxygen generation. An initial screening of the AL(DIPY)3 complexes via in vitro phototoxicity studies against a mouse colon carcinoma cell line (CT26) was promising as these complexes were able to trigger cell death upon irradiation at safe nanomolar and micromolar concentrations. The results highlight the potential of aluminum dipyrrin complexes as a broadly applicable class of photosensitizers.

# Understanding and optimizing Li substitution in P2-type Sodium Layered Oxides for Sodium-Ion Batteries

## 钠离子电池P2-type钠层状氧化物中Li取代的理解和优化

**Authors:** Eduardo, Villalobos-Portillo

In the quest for novel cathode materials for Na-ion batteries, we studied a family of Li-substituted P2 layered oxides with nominal stoichiometry Na5/6LiyNi5/12-3y/2Mn7/12+y/2O2 (y = 2/18, 3/18, 4/18, 5/18). We explored the consequences of Li substitution, as well as the challenge of elevating the Na content in the pristine materials through solid-state synthesis. By in situ temperature-resolved x-ray diffraction (XRD) we observed the synthesis process, clearly showing the formation of an intermediate Li2MnO3 structure with increasing Li content. Structurally, honeycomb ordering is observed in all samples, while we show that Li induces the loss of Na+/vacancy ordering hence it leads to more disordered Na positions. Electrochemically, this family of materials exhibits an increasing trend of polarized hysteresis in the first cycle, suggesting the contribution of oxygen redox. We coupled semi-simultaneous operando x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and XRD to appreciate the structural evolution and redox behavior during this process. We verified that Li in the transition metal site eliminates phase transitions at high voltage and modifies the activation of O-redox. As confirmed by our XANES analysis and by Density Functional Theory calculations, the Li-free sample already surprisingly show anionic redox despite the residual availability of Ni-redox, due to the peculiar density of states dominated by Ni-O hybridized states at high state of charge. On the other hand, Li-containing samples have O non-bonding states that lead to increasing O-redox contribution as expected due to the limited Ni content. One composition (Na0.745(6)Li0.164(4)Ni0.238(1)Mn0.599(3)O2) proves to have the lowest proportion of O-redox among all samples, coupled with reduced phase transitions, disordered occupancy of Na sites, and small volume change during cycling (4.8%). This material hence delivers the best balance of cycling stability (∼92% after 100 cycles in half cells), capacity (> 100 mAh/g) and rate capability. Determining this optimal compositional range is a promising starting point for further development of P2 layered oxides as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries and can be generalized to other families of Na-based layered oxides with redox-inactive dopants.
