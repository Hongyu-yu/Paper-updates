# Ehrenfest dynamics with localized atomic-orbital basis sets within the projector augmented-wave method

## 在投影仪增强波方法中具有局部原子轨道基础集的Ehrenfest动力学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00168

arXiv:2412.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory with linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis sets is useful for studying large atomic systems, especially when it comes to computationally highly demanding time-dependent dynamics. We have implemented the Ehrenfest molecular dynamics (ED) method with the approximate approach of Tomfohr and Sankey within the projector augmented-wave code GPAW. We apply this method to small molecules as well as larger periodic systems, and elucidate its limits, advantages, and disadvantages in comparison to the existing implementation of Ehrenfest dynamics with a real-space grid representation. For modest atomic velocities, LCAO-ED shows satisfactory accuracy at a much reduced computational cost. This method will be particularly useful for modeling ion irradiation processes that require large amounts of vacuum in the simulation cell.

# Is p-type doping in TeO2 feasible?

## 在TeO2中进行p型掺杂是否可行？

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00338

arXiv:2412.00338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-bandgap two-dimensional (2D) beta-TeO2 has been reported as a high-mobility p-type transparent semiconductor (Nat. Electron. 2021, 4, 277-283), attracting significant attention. This "breakthrough" not only challenges the conventional characterization of TeO2 as an insulator but also conflicts with the anticipated difficulty in hole doping of TeO2 by established chemical trends. Notably, the reported Fermi level of 0.9 eV above the valence band maximum (VBM) actually suggests that the material is an insulator, contradicting the high hole density obtained by Hall effect measurement. Furthermore, the detected residual Se and the possible reduced elemental Te in the 2D beta-TeO2 samples introduces complexity, considering that elemental Se, Te, and Te1-xSex themselves are high-mobility p-type semiconductor. Therefore, doubts regarding the true cause of the p-type conductivity observed in the 2D beta-TeO2 samples arise. In this work, we employ density functional theory calculations to illustrate that TeO2, whether in its bulk forms of alpha-, beta-, or gamma-TeO2, or in 2D beta-TeO2, inherently exhibits insulating properties and poses challenges in carrier doping due to its shallow conduction band minimum and deep valence band maximum (VBM). Our findings shed light on the insulating electrical properties and doping difficulty of TeO2, contrasting with the claimed p-type conductivity in the 2D beta-TeO2 samples, prompting inquiries into the true origin of the p-type conductivity.

# Collective quantum phases in frustrated arrays of Josephson junctions

## 约瑟夫森结受挫阵列中的集体量子相

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00391

arXiv:2412.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study collective quantum phases and quantum phase transitions occurring in frustrated sawtooth arrays of small quantum Josephson junctions. Frustration is introduced through the periodic arrangement of $0$- and $\pi$- Josephson junctions with the Josephson coupling energies $\alpha E_\mathrm{J}$ of different signs, $-1\leq \alpha \leq 1$. The complexity of the potential landscape of the system is controlled by the frustration parameter $f=(1-\alpha)/2$. The potential energy has a single global minimum in the non-frustrated regime ($ff_\mathrm{cr}=0.75$). We address the coherent quantum regime and identify several collective quantum phases: disordered (insulating) and ordered (superconducting) phases in the non-frustrated regime, as well as highly entangled patterns of vortices and anti-vortices in the frustrated regime. These collective quantum phases are controlled by several physical parameters: the frustration $f$, the Josephson coupling, and the charging energies of junctions and islands. We map the control parameter phase diagram by characterizing the quantum dynamics of frustrated Josephson junction arrays by spatially and temporally resolved quantum-mechanical correlation function of the local magnetization.

# Electronic Structure, mass fluctuation, and Localized Bond Properties of two-dimensional double-layer transition metal chalcogenide MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) Calculated Based on Density Functional Theory and BBC model

Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.

arXiv:2412.01390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the optical properties of color centers in silicon carbide is essential for their use in quantum technologies, such as single-photon emission and spin-based qubits. In this work, first-principles calculations were employed using the r2SCAN density functional to investigate the electronic and vibrational properties of neutral divacancy configurations in 4H-SiC. Our approach addresses the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect in the excited states of axial divacancies. By explicitly solving the multimode dynamical Jahn-Teller problem, we compute emission and absorption lineshapes for axial divacancy configurations, providing insights into the complex interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. The results show strong alignment with experimental data, underscoring the predictive power of the methodologies. Our calculations predict spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect in the excited state of the $kh$ divacancy, accompanied by the lowest electron-phonon coupling among the four configurations and distinct polarizability. These unique properties facilitate its selective excitation, setting it apart from other divacancy configurations, and highlight its potential utility in quantum technology applications. These findings underscore the critical role of electron-phonon interactions and optical properties in spin defects with pronounced Jahn-Teller effects, offering valuable insights for the design and integration of quantum emitters for quantum technologies.

# An alternative GPU acceleration for a pseudopotential plane-waves density functional theory code with applications to metallic systems

## 伪电位平面波密度泛函理论代码的替代GPU加速，并应用于金属系统

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01695

arXiv:2412.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an alternative GPU acceleration for plane waves pseudopotentials electronic structure codes designed for systems that have small unit cells but require a large number of k points to sample the Brillouin zone as happens, for instance, in metals. We discuss the diagonalization of the Kohn and Sham equations and the solution of the linear system derived in density functional perturbation theory. Both problems take advantage from a rewriting of the routine that applies the Hamiltonian to the Bloch wave-functions to work simultaneously (in parallel on the GPU threads) on the wave-functions with different wave-vectors k, as many as allowed by the GPU memory. Our implementation is written in CUDA Fortran and makes extensive use of kernel routines that run on the GPU (GLOBAL routines) or can be called from inside the GPU threads (DEVICE routines). We compare our method with the CPUs only calculation and with the approach currently implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO that uses GPU accelerated libraries for the FFT and for the linear algebra tasks such as the matrix-matrix multiplications as well as OpenACC directives for loop parallelization. We show in a realistic example that our method can give a significant improvement in the cases for which it has been designed.

# Ab initio study of Proximity-Induced Superconductivity in PbTe/Pb heterostructures

arXiv:2412.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices have been proposed as promising platforms for detecting and analyzing Majorana zero modes, which find applications in topological quantum computing. In this work, we solve the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations to describe the normal and superconducting properties of a PbTe/Pb heterostructure. We resolve a proximity-induced superconducting gap on the PbTe side. The hybridization between PbTe and Pb causes the emergence of a soft Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like superconducting gap. We compute the anomalous charge density in real space, estimating its decay length and showing that the pairing potential is anisotropic, which is a necessary condition for unconventional superconductivity. Contrary to the models that predict Majorana zero modes in these interfaces, we find a significantly large Schottky barrier in the normal state preventing the emergence of zero modes. Our findings strengthen the understanding of the physics governing PbTe/Pb hybrid devices and their viability for Majorana zero modes applications.

# Quasi-optimal sampling from Gibbs states via non-commutative optimal transport metrics

## 通过非交换最佳运输度量从吉布斯状态进行准最佳采样

arXiv:2412.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from and preparing quantum Gibbs states of local commuting Hamiltonians on hypercubic lattices of arbitrary dimension. We prove that any such Gibbs state which satisfies a clustering condition that we coin decay of matrix-valued quantum conditional mutual information (MCMI) can be quasi-optimally prepared on a quantum computer. We do this by controlling the mixing time of the corresponding Davies evolution in a normalized quantum Wasserstein distance of order one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a non-commutative transport metric has been used in the study of quantum dynamics, and the first time quasi-rapid mixing is implied by solely an explicit clustering condition. Our result is based on a weak approximate tensorization and a weak modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for such systems, as well as a new general weak transport cost inequality. If we furthermore assume a constraint on the local gap of the thermalizing dynamics, we obtain rapid mixing in trace distance for interactions beyond the range of two, thereby extending the state-of-the-art results that only cover the nearest neighbor case. We conclude by showing that systems that admit effective local Hamiltonians, like quantum CSS codes at high temperature, satisfy this MCMI decay and can thus be efficiently prepared and sampled from.

# Origin of competing charge density waves in kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$

arXiv:2403.17058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding competing charge density wave (CDW) orders in the bilayer kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ remains challenging. Experimentally, upon cooling, short-range order with wave vector $\mathbf{q}_{2}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ forms, which is subsequently suppressed by the condensation of long-range $\mathbf{q}_{3}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ CDW order at lower temperature. Theoretically, however, the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW is predicted as the ground state, leaving the CDW mechanism elusive. Here, using anharmonic phonon-phonon calculations combined with density functional theory, we predict a temperature-driven structural phase transitions from the high-temperature pristine phase to the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW, followed by the low-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW, explaining experimental observations. We demonstrate that semi-core electron states stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW over the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW. Furthermore, we find that the out-of-plane lattice parameter controls the competing CDWs, motivating us to propose compressive bi-axial strain as an experimental protocol to stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW. Finally, we suggest Ge or Pb doping at the Sn site as another potential avenue to control CDW instabilities. Our work provides a full theory of CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, rationalizing experimental observations and resolving earlier discrepancies between theory and experiment.

Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.

# Adaptive Constraint Integration for Simultaneously Optimizing Crystal Structures with Multiple Targeted Properties

## 用于同时优化具有多个目标特性的晶体结构的自适应约束集成

arXiv:2410.08562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In materials science, finding crystal structures that have targeted properties is crucial. While recent methodologies such as Bayesian optimization and deep generative models have made some advances on this issue, these methods often face difficulties in adaptively incorporating various constraints, such as electrical neutrality and targeted properties optimization, while keeping the desired specific crystal structure. To address these challenges, we have developed the Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which utilizes state-of-the-art property prediction models and their gradients to directly optimize input crystal structures for targeted properties simultaneously. SMOACS enables the integration of adaptive constraints into the optimization process without necessitating model retraining. Thanks to this feature, SMOACS has succeeded in simultaneously optimizing targeted properties while maintaining perovskite structures, even with models trained on diverse crystal types. We have demonstrated the band gap optimization while meeting a challenging constraint, that is, maintaining electrical neutrality in large atomic configurations up to 135 atom sites, where the verification of the electrical neutrality is challenging. The properties of the most promising materials have been confirmed by density functional theory calculations.

Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.

Abstract: The simulation of non-Markovian quantum dynamics plays an important role in the understanding of charge and exciton dynamics in the condensed phase environment, and yet it remains computationally expensive on classical computers. We have developed a variational quantum algorithm that is capable of simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The algorithm captures the non-Markovian effect by employing the Ehrenfect trajectories in the path integral formulation and the Monte Carlo sampling of the thermal distribution. We tested the algorithm with the spin-boson model on the quantum simulator and the results match well with the exact ones. The algorithm naturally fits into the parallel computing platform of the NISQ devices and is well suited for anharmonic system-bath interactions and multi-state systems.

Intermolecular non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen, halogen and chalcogen bonds, are crucial in gas phase and condensed phase chemistry. Here we investigate and challenge the conflicting ‘σ-hole’ and ‘σ*’ paradigms commonly used for the description of chalcogen bonds. Using density functional theory with our absolutely localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO-EDA) scheme, we explore the conformational and geometric space of a range of tellurophene-like systems. Our results show that while the s-hole description is adequate to predict the electrostatic component of chalcogen bonds, the additional contribution of charge transfer is needed to fully describe these interactions. We anticipate that our findings will offer fresh insight into the use of non-covalent interactions for crystal engineering, synthetic and biological chemistry.

Trifluoromethylphenols (TFMPs) are environmental contaminants that exist as transformation products of aryl-CF3 pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Their −CF3 moiety raises concerns as it may form problematic fluorinated transformation products such as the persistent pollutant trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This study investigates the hydrolysis and spontaneous defluorination mechanisms of 2-TFMP, 3-TFMP, 4-TFMP, and 2-Cl-4-TFMP under environmentally relevant aqueous conditions, and under alkaline pH to investigate the mechanism of defluorination. 3-TFMP did not undergo hydrolysis. The other TFMPs reacted to primarily form the corresponding hydroxybenzoic acids and fluoride. High-resolution mass spectrometry identified a benzoyl fluoride intermediate in the hydrolysis of 4-TFMP and other dimer-like transformation products of the 4- and 2-Cl-4-TFMP. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the key defluorination step proceeds via an E1cb mechanism, driven by β-elimination. Experimental and computational results demonstrated substituent-dependent differences in reactivity, and the importance of the deprotonation of TFMPs for the hydrolysis reaction to proceed. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the complete defluorination of TFMPs and broader implications for the environmental defluorination of other PFAS.
