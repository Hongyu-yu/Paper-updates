Abstract: Since the discovery of MgB2 with Tc=39K, various metal diborides of MB2 have been intensively studied to find possible conventional high-temperature superconductors. A possible 2D structure of the metal diboride has been shown to be in the form of M2B2. Using density functional theory, we investigated phase stability and possible conventional superconductors for non-hydrogenation M2B2, light hydrogenation M2B2H, and heavy hydrogenation M2B2H4 of transition metal borides M2B2 (M=Sc,Y,V,Nb). The light hydrogenation M2B2H show as if they were a perturbed system from the non-hydrogenation in which the electronic structure, the phonon property, and the possible superconducting state are slightly changed. However, the heavy hydrogenation of M2B2H4 give very promising 2D materials with a possible high Tc of up to 84K at ambient pressure. This would fill the gaps for the study of possible conventional high-temperature superconductors at ambient pressure.

Abstract: Energy degeneracy in physical systems may be induced by symmetries of the Hamiltonian, and the resonance of degeneracy states in carbon nanostructures can effectively enhance the stability of the system. Combining the octet rule, we introduce a parameter-free statistical model to determine the physical properties by lifting the energy degeneracy in carbon nanostructures. This model offers a direct path to accurately ascertain electron density distributions in quantum systems, akin to how charge density is used in density functional theory to deduce system properties. Our methodology diverges from traditional quantum mechanics, focusing instead on this unique statistical model by minimizing bonding free energy to determine the fundamental properties of materials. Applied to carbon nanoclusters and graphynes, our model not only precisely predicts bonding energies and electron density without relying on external parameters, but also enhances the prediction of electronic structures through bond occupancy numbers, which act as effective hopping integrals. This innovation offers insights into the structural properties and quantum behavior of electrons across various dimensions.

Abstract: Transition-metal phthalocyanine molecules have attracted considerable interest in the context of spintronics device development due to their amenability to diverse bonding regimes and their intrinsic magnetism. The latter is highly influenced by the quantum fluctuations that arise at the inevitable metal-molecule interface in a device architecture. In this study, we have systematically investigated the dynamical screening effects in phthalocyanine molecules hosting a series of transition-metal ions (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in contact with the Cu(111) surface. Using comprehensive density functional theory plus Anderson's Impurity Model calculations, we show that the orbital-dependent hybridization and electron correlation together result in strong charge and spin fluctuations. While the instantaneous spin moments of the transition-metal ions are near atomic-like, we find that screening gives rise to considerable lowering or even quenching of these. Our results highlight the importance of quantum fluctuations in metal-contacted molecular devices, which may influence the results obtained from theoretical or experimental probes, depending on their possibly material-dependent characteristic sampling time-scales.

# Discretization of Structured Bosonic Environments at Finite Temperature by Interpolative Decomposition: Theory and Application

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theory for a novel method to discretize the spectral density of a bosonic heat bath, as introduced in [H. Takahashi and R. Borrelli, J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{161}, 151101 (2024)]. The approach leverages a low-rank decomposition of the Fourier-transform relation connecting the bath correlation function to its spectral density. By capturing the time, frequency, and temperature dependencies encoded in the spectral density-autocorrelation function relation, our method significantly reduces the degrees of freedom required for simulating open quantum system dynamics. We benchmark our approach against existing methods and demonstrate its efficacy through applications to both simple models and a realistic electron transfer process in biological systems. Additionally, we show that this new approach can be effectively combined with the tensor-train formalism to investigate the quantum dynamics of systems interacting with complex non-Markovian environments. Finally, we provide a perspective on the selection and application of various spectral density discretization techniques.

# Quantum Simulation of Spin-Boson Models with Structured Bath

The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems that describe many dissipative processes in physical, chemical and biological systems. Trapped ions present an ideal platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, by accessing both the high-quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions for spins and bosons, respectively. We demonstrate a fully programmable method to simulate dissipative dynamics of spin-boson models using a chain of trapped ions, where the initial temperature and the spectral densities of the boson bath are engineered by controlling the state of the motional modes and their coupling with qubit states. Our method provides a versatile and
precise experimental tool for studying open quantum systems.
