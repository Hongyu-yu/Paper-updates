Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.

Abstract: The development of advanced materials with high specific energy is crucial for enabling sustainable energy storage solutions, particularly in applications such as lithium-air batteries. Lithium peroxide (Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$) is a key discharge product in non-aqueous lithium-air systems, where its structural and electronic properties significantly influence battery performance. In this work, we investigate the atomic structure, electronic band structure, and Wannier functions of bulk Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$ using density functional theory. The performance of different basis sets of numerical atomic orbitals are compared with respect to a converged plane-wave basis results. We analyze the material's ionic characteristics, the formation of molecular orbitals in oxygen dimers, and the band gap discrepancies between various computational approaches. Furthermore, we develop a localized Wannier basis to model electron-vibration interactions and explore their implications for polaron formation. Our findings provide a chemically intuitive framework for understanding electron-lattice coupling and offer a basis for constructing reduced models that accurately describe the dynamics of polarons in Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$. These insights contribute to the broader goal of improving energy storage technologies and advancing the field of materials design.

# Carbon-based light emitting defects in different layers of hexagonal boron nitride

arXiv:2412.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have garnered significant interest as single photon emitters (SPEs) due to their remarkable optical and quantum properties. An intriguing property of these defects is that they can be spin-active ($S\geq 1$), even if weakly interacting. Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that two monomers of C-based defects of the same species can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature, even when they are separated $\lesssim 1$ nm, if they reside in different layers. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of C defects in different layers lies within $1.6-2.2$ eV range. Also, we found defects that deviate from the typical phonon replica patterns, potentially explaining the observed phonon replicas in yellow emitters in hBN.

Abstract: In this work, we present an empirical force field for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers, derived via a bottom-up strategy from first principles calculations. We aim to deliver a simple analytical force field for boron nitride which is efficient and applicable to large-scale simulations, without compromising its accuracy. The force field is developed with the goal to analytically reproducing the potential energy contributions arising from planar bond-stretching and bond-angle-bending deformations, as well as from out-of-plane torsional deformations, as obtained from periodic density functional theory calculations. Analytical anharmonic potential energy functions were employed to describe and parameterize the force field through a fitting process. The potential is applied for estimating in-plane (stiffness matrix and elastic constants) and out-of-plane (bending and Gaussian rigidity) mechanical properties of monolayer hBNs using both molecular mechanics calculations and analytical formulas. Additionally, we determined the elastic properties of more complex nanostructures, including hBN nanotubes and nanotori. An analytical expression has been provided for the dependence of the bending rigidity of relatively large diameter hBN nanotubes on their radius.

**Authors:** B. Bradji, M. L. Benkhedir

arXiv:2412.17664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied the structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer in its pure and doped forms, using the density functional theory (DFT), and the calculations were performed using Quantum Espresso (QE) software package. The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.

**Authors:** Kuntal Talit, David A. Strubbe

Abstract: The mechanical properties of hybrid perovskite materials are important for device flexibility, resistance to fracture, epitaxial growth, surface energetics of quantum dots, and induction or relief of stress in thin films due to thermal expansion and phase changes. These issues are particularly salient for solar cells in space applications. Nonetheless, few studies are available on the mechanical properties of the paradigmatic hybrid perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ (MAPI). Experimental results are only available for the room-temperature tetragonal phase, and there are significant discrepancies among them. Results from density functional theory (DFT) are available for all three phases but have even larger discrepancies from each other and from experiments. To clarify the disorder in the literature, we have studied the elastic properties of all three phases in detail with DFT calculations. We have examined the effect of different aspects in calculation methodology such as use of energy or stress, the structure, exchange-correlation functionals, Van der Waals corrections, pseudopotentials, $k$-point sampling, and formulas for anisotropic elasticity and polycrystalline averages. Our results provide accurate reference values and an appropriate general methodology for elastic properties of metal halide perovskites.

Abstract: Quantum-mechanical simulations can offer atomic-level insights into chemical processes on surfaces. This understanding is crucial for the rational design of new solid catalysts as well as materials to store energy and mitigate greenhouse gases. However, achieving the accuracy needed for reliable predictions has proven challenging. Density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse quantum-mechanical method, can often lead to inconsistent predictions, necessitating accurate methods from correlated wave-function theory (cWFT). However, the high computational demands and significant user intervention associated with cWFT have traditionally made it impractical to carry out for surfaces. In this work, we address this challenge, presenting an automated framework which leverages multilevel embedding approaches, to apply accurate cWFT methods to ionic surfaces with computational costs approaching DFT. With this framework, we have reproduced experimental adsorption enthalpies for a diverse set of 19 adsorbate-surface systems. Moreover, we resolve long-standing debates on the adsorption configuration of several systems, while offering valuable benchmarks to assess DFT. This framework is completely open-source, making it possible to now routinely apply cWFT to complex problems in ionic surface chemistry.

Abstract: In standard bosonic Josephson junctions (BJJs), particles tunnel between two single-well potentials linked by a finite barrier. The dynamics of standard BJJs have been extensively studied, both at the many-body and mean-field levels of theory. In the present work, we introduce the concept of a composite BJJ. In a composite BJJ, particles tunnel between two double-well potentials linked by a finite potential barrier between them. We focus on many-body facets of quantum dynamics and investigate how the complex structure of the junction influences tunneling. Employing the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons method, highly-accurate many-boson wave-functions are obtained from which properties are computed. We analyze the dynamics using the survival probability, the degree of fragmentation of the junction, and the fluctuations of observables, and discuss how many-boson tunneling behaves, and how it may be controlled, using the composite nature of the junction. A central result of this work relates to the degree of fragmentation of composite BJJs with different numbers of bosons. We provide strong evidence that a universal degree of fragmentation into multiple time-dependent modes takes place. Further applications are briefly discussed.

Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) containing covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials, demonstrating single photon emission and long-lived spins. The defect introduces new optical transitions due to both symmetry breaking induced band splitting and introduction of in-gap electronic states. We investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. The SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite with the resulting compound displaying a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of these covalent defects. Density functional theory calculations are then performed on the adsorbed compounds that may arise (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). These calculations indicate that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively. Moreover, these adsorbates introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV. Our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.

Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.

**Authors:** Fabian, Pieck

Area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) has emerged as a transformative technique in nanotechnology, enabling the precise deposition of materials on designated substrates while preventing unwanted growth on adjacent surfaces. This capability is critical for applications in microelectronics, catalysis, and energy technologies. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), are indispensable for uncovering the mechanisms underlying AS-ALD, providing insights into surface interactions, selectivity mechanisms, and precursor design. This review introduces the theoretical background of computational techniques applied to AS-ALD and provides a detailed overview of their applications. Special emphasis is placed on the use of ab initio methods to explore surface chemistry, optimize precursor and inhibitor properties, and improve selectivity. A comprehensive overview of the literature is given with an analysis of research questions targeted, and methods used. By consolidating the state of knowledge and identifying future challenges, this work aims to guide researchers in further leveraging computational approaches to drive innovations in AS-ALD processes.

**Authors:** Karl, Ronnby

Downscaling of metal interconnects has become a bottleneck in the back-end-of-line processing of CMOS devices. The conductivity of the commonly used Cu metal drastically reduces at nanoscale, limiting its use as the devices shrink, as the metal starts forming non-conductive islands. This has led to the requirement for new interconnect metals such as Co and Ru, as they have a much higher tendency to form conductive films at nanoscale. Understanding how the morphology depends on the metals’ atomistic properties is necessary to continue the rapid development of interconnects. In this study we have used first principles density functional theory calculations to investigate how the morphology of Cu, Co, and Ru differs on TaN substrates. We investigate the binding of both singe metal atoms and different configurations of four atom clusters to obtain the metals’ binding energy to the surface and their clustering energy. The morphology of the metals was then investigated by finite temperature ab initio molecular dynamic simulations of larger metal structures that can display 2D and 3D morphologies. Comparing the binding energies with the obtained morphology allows us to conclude the effect the energies have on the morphology. These insights helps in the development of morphology predictors allowing a quick method for finding new interconnect materials.
