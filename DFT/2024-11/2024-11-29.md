# Deciphering Atomic Polarizability: The Absolute Radii and Orbital Contributions Visited

Polarizability is a fundamental property in molecular sciences. It depends on the atom and molecule size and characterizes how ease of deforming the electron cloud by an electric field. Previous studies suggested that the electronic distribution of the outmost orbital can be used to determine the ground state properties of the atom like hardness, polarizability, and electronegativity. Additionally, the “absolute radius”—the most probable radius of the outermost orbital—has been used to derive atomic properties. In our study, we present a new set of absolute radii for various atoms and ions across the periodic table, calculated using high level quantum mechanical calculations. These radii exhibit greater accuracy compared to those previously derived using Slater shielding constants and could offer enhanced utility for diverse scientific applications. We also calculated atomic polarizabilities for a range of atoms and ions using three different approaches. One method assumes a spherical electron distribution based on the absolute radii, while the other two rely on the radial distribution function of the outermost orbital(s). Comparisons with reference polarizabilities obtained from density functional theory (DFT) indicate that while these strategies provide qualitative insights, they do not yield quantitative agreement. To better understand the factors influencing atomic polarizability, we evaluated the contributions of different orbitals. Interestingly, our results reveal that inner orbitals contribute significantly to polarizability, which are comparable to the outermost orbital. This finding challenges the conventional view of polarizability as solely a volume-dependent property linked to the valence orbital. Instead, polarizability might be better considered as an energetic property arising from the collective contributions of various orbitals.

# Thermodynamically Favoured Bulk O2 Formation on Charging in LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 Cathode Materials

## 在LiCoO2和LiNiO2阴极材料中充电时，热力学有利于大量O2的形成

The formation of O2 molecules within the bulk of LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 cathode materials during charging has been reported experimentally, but the validity and significance of these observations remain debated. Using density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that at high states of charge, layered LiNiO2 and LiCoO2 are thermodynamically unstable with respect to both O2 gas release and internal decomposition forming bulk-confined O2 molecules, indicating that, from a thermodynamic perspective, the oxygen chemistry of these stoichiometric layered oxides parallels that of Li-rich oxides, and may likewise limit their long-term cycling stability.
