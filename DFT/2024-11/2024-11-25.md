Abstract: We explore the structural and electronic properties of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 on LaAlO3(001) and SrTiO3(001) by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. For La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/LaAlO$_3$(001), we find that compressive strain and electron doping across the interface result in the unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states. In sharp contrast, no charge transfer is observed for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/SrTiO$_3$(001). Surprisingly, tensile strain drives a metallization of the bonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, rendering a Fermi surface topology resembling the superconducting bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under high pressure. Concomitantly, significant octahedral rotations are retained. We discuss the fundamental differences between hydrostatic pressure and epitaxial strain regarding the crystal geometry and Ni $3d$ orbital occupation, and establish that strain provides a much stronger control over the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization. The results suggest epitaxial La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under tensile strain as interesting system to provide novel insights into the physics of bilayer nickelates and possibly induce superconductivity without external pressure.

Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.

Abstract: In this report, the optical properties of Ta doped SrTiO3 (STO) due to its potential in transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) is explored by a combination of theoretical studies based on density functional theory and spectroscopic ellipsometry. To achieve this theoretically, we vary the concentration of Ta from 0 - 12.5% in SrTi1-xTaxO3 system by substitutional doping and report its effect on the resulting structural, chemical, electronic, chemical, and optical properties. Additionally, we perform band unfolding to shed light on the true nature of optical transitions due to Ta doping. We verify these results experimentally by fabricating epitaxial SrTi1-xTaxO3 thin films ( x = 0 - 5%) by pulsed laser deposition and obtain the optical dielectric properties of the system with the help of spectroscopic ellipsometry. By combining theoretical and experimental studies, we provide evidence that the band gap of STO increases due to Ta doping while also enhancing its electronic properties. The findings of our study offer an extensive understanding of the intricacies associated with elemental doping in perovskite oxides and propose strategies for addressing obstacles associated with TCOs.

Abstract: Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on approximations that introduce ambiguities. This series of papers aims to establish a rigorous theoretical framework to guide the development of a QM/cDFT formulation that clarifies the approximations involved. In this first paper, we establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum (QM)-classical (MM) systems within the canonical ensemble. We derive the equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm QM and N mm MM particles and, based on this derivation, propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM-MM density matrix. By leveraging permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the variational problem using functionals of objects having reduced dimensionalities. Three different formulations are presented, each using quantities with progressively lower dimensionalities. This ultimately enables computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the QM and MM one-body densities, generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM-MM systems. In a subsequent paper, this formalism will be extended to the grand canonical ensemble, allowing classical particle number fluctuations. This extension, in which cDFT is most naturally formulated, provides a framework for studying solvation problems.

# Accurate and efficient localized basis sets for two-dimensional materials

Abstract: First-principles density functional theory (DFT) codes which employ a localized basis offer advantages over those which use plane-wave bases, such as better scaling with system size and better suitability to low-dimensional systems. The trade-off is that care must be taken in order to generate a good localized basis set which is efficient and accurate in a variety of environments. Here we develop and make freely available optimized local basis sets for two common two-dimensional (2D) materials, graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, for the \siesta DFT code. Each basis set is benchmarked against the \abinit plane-wave code, using the same pseudopotentials and exchange-correlation functionals. We find that a significant improvement is obtained by including the $l+2$ polarization orbitals ($4f$) to the basis set, which greatly improves angular flexibility. The optimized basis sets yield much better agreement with plane-wave calculations for key features of the physical system, including total energy, lattice constant and cohesive energy. The optimized basis sets also result in a speedup of the calculations with respect to the non-optimized, native choices.

Abstract: The quest for topological superconductors triggers revived interests in resolving non-s-wave pairing channels mediated by phonons. While density functional theory and denstify functional perturbtaion theory have established a powerful framework to calculate electron-phonon couplings in real materials in a first-principles way, its application is largely limited to conventional s-wave superconductivity. Here, we formulate an efficient and simple-to-use algorithm for first-principles pairing channel analysis, and apply it to several representative material systems.

# A DFT analysis for synthesizing vitamin A

Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major nutritional concern in lower-income countries. It is responsible for thousands of deaths in those countries every year. Thus, finding the optimal route for vitamin A synthesis is essential, especially for the countries that are influenced by VAD. Three mechanisms of synthesizing Vitamin A have been evaluated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This experiment investigated the BASF C15 + C5 Wittig approach, the Rhône-Poulenc C15 + C5 Julia approach, and the Kuraray C10 + C10 approach. The electronic energy, highest occupied molecular orbital energy, and dipole moments were calculated using the B3LYP functional and the 3-21g basis set. The energy profiles of these synthesis routes were compared to determine the most energetically favorable method. The Julia approach has the lowest energy change, indicating its higher efficiency in terms of energy compared to the Wittig and Kuraray methods. It is shown that other factors such as scalability and raw material availability should also be considered in industrial applications.

# Density Functional Theoretical method for modelling Cobalt-doped g-C3N4 sensor for detecting aniline - a cancer biomarker

## 用于检测癌症生物标志物苯胺的钴掺杂g-C3N4传感器的密度泛函理论方法

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-pctwk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Using DFT calculations, we investigated the sensitivity of the lung cancer biomarkers, such as acetone, ethanol, and aniline - on pristine and Cobalt (Co)-doped g-C3N4 systems. The adsorption energy calculations reveal that these biomarkers undergo chemisorption on pristine g-C3N4, resulting in long recovery times, which restricts the suitability of pristine g-C3N4 as a sensor. Alternatively, the band gap of Co-g-C3N4 (0.98 eV) is lower than that of pristine g-C3N4 (1.33 eV), which increases the conductivity of Co-g-C3N4 (5.11 × 10⁻⁹ S/m) compared to pristine g-C3N4 (5.714 × 10⁻¹² S/m) - suggesting obvious selective sensitivity towards the biomarkers. Our results indicate that acetone adsorbs on the Co-g-C3N4 surface via chemisorption process, aniline undergoes physisorption, and ethanol exhibits an intermediate adsorption behaviour. Recovery time analysis revealed that aniline (0.09 s) and ethanol (3.64 s) can be recovered quickly at 398 K, which further accelerates under UV irradiation at 298 K. However, the conductivity calculations revealed that aniline exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.72 × 10-7 and the work function calculations manifested stronger sensitivity of Co-g-C3N4 towards aniline compared to acetone and ethanol. These results predict, Co-g-C3N4 as a superior sensor for aniline biomarker due to its physisorption behaviour, lower recovery time, higher conductivity and significant change in work function. The state-of-the-art analysis of Co-g-C3N4 as a promising reusable sensor for detecting aniline in exhaled breath is hitherto unknow to date.
