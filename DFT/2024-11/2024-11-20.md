Abstract: Recent work highlighted the importance of higher-order correlations in quantum dynamics for a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and thermalization. The full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, the framework encompassing correlations, can be formalized using the language of Free Probability theory. In this context, chaotic dynamics at long times are proposed to lead to free independence or "freeness" of observables. In this work, we investigate these issues in a paradigmatic semiclassical model - the kicked top - which exhibits a transition from integrability to chaos. Despite its simplicity, we identify several non-trivial features. By numerically studying 2n-point out-of-time-order correlators, we show that in the fully chaotic regime, long-time freeness is reached exponentially fast. These considerations lead us to introduce a large deviation theory for freeness that enables us to define and analyze the associated time scale. The numerical results confirm the existence of a hierarchy of different time scales, indicating a multifractal approach to freeness in this model. Our findings provide novel insights into the long-time behavior of chaotic dynamics and may have broader implications for the study of many-body quantum dynamics.

# Tracing quasiparticle dynamics and hybridization dynamics in PuCoGa5

arXiv:2411.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PuCoGa5 has attracted significant attention due to its record-breaking superconducting transition temperature Tc=18.5 K among known f-electron superconductors. Here we systematically investigated the evolution of correlated electronic states in the plutonium-based unconventional superconductor PuCoGa5 upon temperature using the embedded dynamical mean-field theory merged with density functional theory. The mixed-valence nature of PuCoGa5 leads to intriguing quasiparticle dynamics and hybridization dynamics. Our findings reveal the presence of Dirac fermions and a temperature-driven localized-itinerant crossover of 5f states. As the temperature decreases, the low-energy quasiparticle resonances develop gradually, while the high-energy quasiparticle resonances exhibit quite different behaviors with an initial increase and subsequent decrease. Furthermore, we identified a characteristic temperature of approximately 290 K for the onset of hybridization gaps, which is much lower than the coherence temperature 580 K for 5f electrons. These results provide valuable insight on the the electronic structures, quasiparticle dynamics, and hybridization processes in 5f correlated electron systems.

# Accurate and efficient localized basis sets for two-dimensional materials

## 二维材料的准确高效的本地化基础集

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12566

arXiv:2411.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles density functional theory (DFT) codes which employ a localized basis offer advantages over those which use plane-wave bases, such as better scaling with system size and better suitability to low-dimensional systems. The trade-off is that care must be taken in order to generate a good localized basis set which is efficient and accurate in a variety of environments. Here we develop and make freely available optimized local basis sets for two common two-dimensional (2D) materials, graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, for the \siesta DFT code. Each basis set is benchmarked against the \abinit plane-wave code, using the same pseudopotentials and exchange-correlation functionals. We find that a significant improvement is obtained by including the $l+2$ polarization orbitals ($4f$) to the basis set, which greatly improves angular flexibility. The optimized basis sets yield much better agreement with plane-wave calculations for key features of the physical system, including total energy, lattice constant and cohesive energy. The optimized basis sets also result in a speedup of the calculations with respect to the non-optimized, native choices.

# A Coherent Theory for Superconductivity through Integration of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory and Density Functional Theory

Abstract: A coherent theory for superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. We propose an integrated theory based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory and density functional theory (DFT), suggesting that superconductivity originates from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for electrons and/or holes, which act as resistance-free superhighways, akin to Cooper pairs in the BCS theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be predicted by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC through DFT. Our integrated theory highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are part of the bulk material and are easily disrupted by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (Tc). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk material, maintaining stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher Tc. This integrated theory is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor, YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.

Abstract: Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on approximations that introduce ambiguities. This series of papers aims to establish a rigorous theoretical framework to guide the development of a QM/cDFT formulation that clarifies the approximations involved. In this first paper, we establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum (QM)-classical (MM) systems within the canonical ensemble. We derive the equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm QM and N mm MM particles and, based on this derivation, propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM-MM density matrix. By leveraging permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the variational problem using functionals of objects having reduced dimensionalities. Three different formulations are presented, each using quantities with progressively lower dimensionalities. This ultimately enables computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the QM and MM one-body densities, generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM-MM systems. In a subsequent paper, this formalism will be extended to the grand canonical ensemble, allowing classical particle number fluctuations. This extension, in which cDFT is most naturally formulated, provides a framework for studying solvation problems.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers promising new avenues for tackling the long-standing challenge of simulating the quantum dynamics of complex chemical systems, particularly open quantum systems coupled to external baths. However, simulating such non-unitary dynamics on quantum computers is challenging since quantum circuits are specifically designed to carry out unitary transformations. Furthermore, chemical systems are often strongly coupled to the surrounding environment, rendering the dynamics non-Markovian and beyond the scope of Markovian quantum master equations like Lindblad or Redfield. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm designed to simulate non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. Our approach enables the implementation of arbitrary quantum master equations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We illustrate the method as applied in conjunction with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method. The effectiveness of the resulting quantum HEOM algorithm (qHEOM) is demonstrated as applied to simulations of the non-Lindbladian electronic energy and charge transfer dynamics in models of the carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 molecular triad dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.

# Energy Decomposition Analysis for excited states:  An Extension based on TDDFT

## 激发态的能量分解分析: 基于TDDFT的扩展

To enhance the understanding of photochemical reactivity and its mechanisms, it is essential to analyze bonding interactions in excited-state reactions. Such insights can aid in optimizing these reactions. This paper presents an energy decomposition analysis method for excited states (exc-EDA), integrating the ground state EDA approach by Morokuma, Ziegler and Rauk with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The methodology focuses on calculating excitation energies, particularly for the intermediate states of the EDA. We introduce two variants: the first uses non-relaxed excitation coefficients (exc-u-EDA), where the excitation coefficients of the excited fragment are used directly; the second optimizes these coefficients for the intermediate states (exc-r-EDA). Exc-EDA can be applied with various density functionals, but the accuracy depends on the functional’s ability to describe the excited state properly. Smaller basis sets result in lower energy values due to fewer virtual orbitals, while larger basis sets produce consistent relative results but may involve different excited states in intermediate steps leading to artificial increase of energy terms in the EDA. The method’s convergence behavior resembles that of TDDFT, with a computational cost approximately three times that of the underlying TDDFT calculation. Application of exc-EDA to singlet fission in pentacene clusters demonstrates its practical value, offering quantitative insights into excited-state bonding and revealing clear, intuitive trends.

# Dynamic formation of Au-C anchors in molecular junctions

## 分子结中au-c锚的动态形成

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-g4q8t-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Terminal anchor groups play a key role in controlling the stability and electronic properties of molecular junctions. Single molecule junctions typically consist of two terminal anchors linking organic molecules to metal electrodes. Here, we show that p-terphenyl derivatives containing only a single terminal anchor exhibit conductance features similar to junctions with two terminal anchors, which arises due to dynamic Au-C bond formation due to a single electron oxidation event at the electrode. A set of p-terphenyl derivatives with one terminal anchor was prepared and characterized using automated chemical synthesis, single molecule electronics experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and non-equilibrium Green’s function-density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) calculations. Our results show that 4-amino-p-terphenyl (PPP) exhibits a distinct and well-defined high conductance state that is greatly diminished or absent in other p-terphenyl derivatives with single terminal anchors, whereas a low conductance state is observed in all amino-p-terphenyl derivatives due to non-covalent dimeric interactions. The electronic properties of PPP are characterized using a combination of cyclic voltammetry, electrolysis, and electron spin resonance, revealing that the high conductance state in PPP arises due to robust Au-C bond formation facilitated by a single electron oxidation event and stabilized by a rigid resonance structure under an electric field. A series of control experiments with different anchor groups reveals the role of primary amines in forming dynamic linkages in molecular junctions. Overall, these results suggest that Au-C bond formation gives rise to high conductance pathways in organic molecules containing only one terminal anchor. Insights from this work can be leveraged in the design of molecular electronic devices, particularly in understanding the mechanisms of molecular binding and junction formation.
