# Manipulating the Optical Response of TaIrTe4 Heterostructures through Band Alignment Strategy

## 通过能带对准策略操纵TaIrTe4异质结构的光学响应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15517

arXiv:2411.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals, such as $TaIrTe_{4}$, characterized by their unique band structures and exotic transport phenomena, have become a central focus in modern electronics. Despite extensive research, a systematic understanding of the impact of heterogeneous integration on the electronic and optical properties of TaIrTe4 device remains elusive. We have carried out density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function formalism calculations for $TaIrTe_{4}/WTe_{2}$, $TaIrTe_{4}/MoTe_{2}$ and $TaIrTe_{4}/h-BN$ heterostructures, aiming to understand the manipulation of photoresponse through various band alignment strategies. The underlying impacts of interlayer interactions, charge transfer and build-in electric field on the electronic properties are carefully investigated. We design a dual-probe photodetector device to understand the overall photoresponse enhancement of the heterogeneous integration by decomposing into the specific strain, interlayer transition, band overlap and symmetry lowering mechanics. These van der Waals integrations provide an ideal platform for studying band alignment physics in self-powered optoelectronic devices.

# Giant Electron-Phonon Coupling Induced Band-Gap Renormalization in Anharmonic Silver Chalcohalide Antiperovskites

## 非谐银硫属卤化物反钙钛矿中的巨大电子-声子耦合引起的带隙重整化

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16279

arXiv:2411.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver chalcohalide antiperovskites (CAP), Ag$_{3}$XY (X = S, Se; Y = Br, I), are a family of highly anharmonic inorganic compounds with great potential for energy applications. However, a substantial and unresolved discrepancy exists between the optoelectronic properties predicted by theoretical first-principles methods and those measured experimentally at room temperature, hindering the fundamental understanding and rational engineering of CAP. In this work, we employ density functional theory, tight-binding calculations, and anharmonic Fr\"ohlich theory to investigate the optoelectronic properties of CAP at finite temperatures. Near room temperature, we observe a giant band-gap ($E_{g}$) reduction of approximately $20$-$60$\% relative to the value calculated at $T = 0$ K, bringing the estimated $E_{g}$ into excellent agreement with experimental measurements. This relative $T$-induced band-gap renormalization is roughly twice the largest value previously reported in the literature for similar temperature ranges. Low-energy optical polar phonon modes, which break inversion symmetry and promote the overlap between silver and chalcogen $s$ electronic orbitals in the conduction band, are identified as the primary contributors to this giant $E_{g}$ reduction. Furthermore, when considering temperature effects, the optical absorption coefficient of CAP increases by nearly an order of magnitude for visible light frequencies. These insights not only bridge a crucial gap between theory and experiment but also open pathways for future technologies where temperature, electric fields, or light dynamically tailor optoelectronic behavior, positioning CAP as a versatile platform for next-generation energy applications.

# Advancing Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture with Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks

## 用氧化还原活性金属有机框架推进电化学CO $_2 $ 捕获

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16444

arXiv:2411.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.

# Critical Role of Disorder for Superconductivity in the Series of Epitaxial Ti(O,N) Films

Abstract: Realizing experimental control of superconductivity is of paramount importance to advancing both basic research and technological applications. Disorder, generally existing in most superconductors, intricately interacts with Cooper pairs and also impacts the performance of quantum devices. In this paper, we report the study of a series of Ti(O,N) crystalline films prepared via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We discover that substituting nitrogen (N) for oxygen (O) in TiO, namely TiO(N), considerably increases the normal-state conductivity and the superconducting transition temperature Tc. The Tc of TiO(N) falling between those of TiO (about 0.5 K) and TiN (about 6 K) is contrary to their comparable Tc predicted by the Migdal Eliasberg theory. It is found that their resistivity vs temperature obeys the Mooij rule, known as the characteristic of metallic glasses. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that strong disorder severely scatters the Bloch electron waves at nonzero momenta, which consequently weakens electron-phonon coupling in TiO(N).

# Stochastic Sampling of Operator Growth Dynamics

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06215

arXiv:2401.06215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forward a Monte Carlo algorithm that samples the Euclidean time operator growth dynamics at infinite temperature. Crucially, our approach is free from the numerical sign problem for a broad family of quantum many-body spin systems, allowing for numerically exact and unbiased calculations. We apply this methodological headway to study the high-frequency dynamics of the mixed-field quantum Ising model (QIM) in one and two dimensions. The resulting quantum dynamics display rapid thermalization, supporting the recently proposed operator growth hypothesis. Physically, our findings correspond to an exponential fall-off of generic response functions of local correlators at large frequencies. Remarkably, our calculations are sufficiently sensitive to detect subtle logarithmic corrections of the hypothesis in one dimension. In addition, in two dimensions, we uncover a non-trivial dynamical crossover between two large frequency decay rates. Lastly, we reveal spatio-temporal scaling laws associated with operator growth, which are found to be strongly affected by boundary contributions.

Abstract: Visualizing the electron dynamics in four dimensions of space and time is crucial to the understanding of several ubiquitous processes in nature. Hence, ultrafast X-ray and electron imaging tools have been developed to probe the dynamics of matter by means of the time-resolved diffraction imaging (TRDI). In this work, we report an extension of the theory underlying the TRDI to the case of the laser-driven electron dynamics in solid state systems. We demonstrate that the TRDI signal encodes essential information about the time-dependent electron density of the system under study and thus makes it possible to decipher the ultrafast quantum dynamics and the electron transfer phenomena in solids. We apply the developed approach to image the laser-driven electron dynamics in neutral graphene showing that the predictions made by the fully quantum version of the TRDI deviate significantly from those obtained with the conventional semiclassical approach.

# Exploring functionalized Zr$_2$N and Sc$_2$N MXenes as superconducting candidates with $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations

Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$). Strain-induced $T_c$ enhancement is demonstrated with an example case for Zr$_2$NCl$_2$. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which are likely influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.

# Review of the foundations of time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT)

## 时间相关密度泛函理论 (TDDFT) 的基础回顾

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16607

arXiv:2411.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is deemed to be a formally rigorous way of dealing with the time-evolution of a many-electron system at the level of electron densities rather than the underlying wavefunctions, which in turn provides an, in principle, exact density-based approach to the treatment of electron excitations in atoms and molecules. This claim has not remained unchallenged, and a detailed account of the relevant criticism is given in this paper. In view of our analysis one has to face the conclusion that there is currently no valid justification for TDDFT, and expectations of finding a remedy here are hardly justified.
