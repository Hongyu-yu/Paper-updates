Abstract: Simulations of quantum dynamics are a key application of near term quantum computing, but are hindered by the twin challenges of noise and small device scale, which limit the executable circuit depths and the number of qubits the algorithm can be run on. Towards overcoming these obstacles we develop and implement a distributed variant of the projected Variational Quantum Dynamics which we dub dp-VQD, which allows to simultaneously alleviate circuit depth and width limitations. We employ the wire cutting technique, which can be executed on the existing devices without quantum or classical communication. We demonstrate the full variational training on noisy simulators, and execute and perform the reconstruction on real IBM quantum devices. The algorithm allows to execute Hamiltonian evolution simulations for problem sizes exceeding devices' nominal qubit counts, and to combine multiple small devices in a distributed computation. We test our approach on the Heisenberg and Hubbard model dynamics.

Abstract: In this Letter, we report first exact volume-entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen--type scar states hosted by PXP and related Hamiltonians corresponding to various geometric configurations of Rydberg-blockaded atom systems, including the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy eigenstate of the PBC chain and proceed by generalizing it to a wide variety of geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the potential experimental relevance of our states by providing a protocol for their preparation on near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator functions.

# Revisiting Boron Cluster Dihydrogen Bonding: Improved Reference Energies and Benchmark of Localized Coupled Cluster and DFT Methods

## 重新审视硼团簇的双氢键合: 改进的参考能量和局部耦合团簇和DFT方法的基准

**Authors:** Golokesh, Santra

Dihydrogen bonds involving boron clusters have gained significant attention in chemistry, biology, and medicine. The reference interaction energies of diH-norm and diH-linear datasets (J. Fanfrlík et al., ChemPhysChem 2020, 21, 2599), which include such bonds both in bent and linear configurations, have been re-evaluated at the gold level. This re-evaluation utilizes explicitly correlated MP2-F12 near the complete basis set limit, CCSD(F12*)/cc-pVQZ-F12, and a (T) correction from conventional CCSD(T)/haV{T,Q}Z calculations. Relative to the updated reference data, Fanfrlík's original reference shows very small root mean square deviations, resulting from significant error compensation between the [CCSD-MP2] and (T) high-level corrections. Furthermore, the revised reference is employed to assess the performance of various localized-orbital coupled-cluster approaches, such as PNO-LCCSD(T), DLPNO-CCSD(T1), and LNO-CCSD(T), at their respective “Normal”, “Tight”, “vTight”, and “vvTight” accuracy settings. For these methods, gradually increasing the basis set size and tightening the accuracy cutoffs improves their performance. For the dihydrogen bonds in diH-norm set, two cost-effective methods with no noticeable loss in accuracy are PNO-LCCSD(T)/Tight/haV{T,Q}Z and DLPNO-CCSD(T1)/TightPNO/CPS(6,7)/haV{T,Q}Z. On the other hand, for the diH-linear set, LNO-CCSD(T)/vTight/haV{T,Q}Z and DLPNO-CCSD(T1)/TightPNO/CPS(6,7)/haV{T,Q}Z are the recommended low-cost methods. Among the more economical density functional methods, r2SCAN-3c demonstrates remarkably good accuracy at a very cheap cost. Additionally, for hybrid and double-hybrid functionals, the incorporation of range separation significantly enhances performance.

# Chemical functionalization of a unique 2D material – Computational prediction for cyclooctyne on the biphenylene network

## 独特的2D材料的化学功能化-亚联苯基网络上环辛炔的计算预测

**Authors:** Hendrik, Weiske

The chemical functionalization of the biphenylene network with the organic adsorbate cyclooctyne is predicted using density functional theory. As a novel 2D material, the biphenylene network has attracted a lot of attention in the material science community due to possible applications in superconductivity, photocatalysis, or hydrogen storage. First studies show the decoration of the biphenylene network using metal atoms, hydrogenation, or the adsorption of simple molecules like CO2. However, covalent functionalization of the material is an unsolved challenge, which could allow tailoring of the material's properties owing to the variability of organic adsorbates. We show that the biphenylene network can be functionalized with cyclooctyne by exploiting its strained triple bond. The reaction mechanism proceeds via the asynchronous [2+2] cycloaddition found for cyclooctyne adsorption before using the energy decomposition analysis for extended systems (pEDA). Chemical functionalization leads to a coverage-dependent change in the effective band structure with the disappearance of the type II Dirac cone known for pristine biphenylene for higher coverages. A brief comparison with other 2D carbon materials shows the high reactivity of the biphenylene network, making it a promising first study for exploring new avenues for the creation of novel functional materials and interfaces and the chemical tuning of their electronic structure.
