<span class="paragraphSection">A comprehensive description of photo-chemical processes in materials, comprising spin-forbidden processes such as intersystem crossing and phosphorescence, implies taking into account spin–orbit coupling. We present an efficient implementation of a perturbative spin–orbit coupling correction for the Tamm–Dancoff approximation of linear-response time-dependent density functional theory within a mixed Gaussian and plane wave framework relying on spin–orbit coupling corrected pseudopotentials. The implementation is validated for a benchmark set of small aromatic molecules, with mean errors in excitation energies and spin–orbit coupling matrix elements being in the range of 0.1–0.6 eV and 1.0–14.4 cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, in comparison with density functional theory and density functional theory multi-reference configuration interaction reference results. Computational timings are given for a bismuth-containing metal–organic framework.</span>

# Ab initio  spin-mapping non-adiabatic dynamics simulations of photochemistry

Link: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/162/8/084105/3337062/Ab-initio-spin-mapping-non-adiabatic-dynamics

<span class="paragraphSection">We perform on-the-fly non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations using the recently developed spin-mapping formalism. Two quantum dynamics approaches based on this mapping formalism, (i) the fully linearized Spin-LSC and (ii) the partially linearized Spin-PLDM, are explored using the quasi-diabatic propagation scheme. We have performed dynamics simulations in four <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> molecular models for which benchmark <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> multiple spawning (AIMS) data have been published. We find that the spin-LSC and the previously reported symmetric quasi-classical (SQC) approaches provide nearly equivalent population dynamics. While we expected the more involved spin-PLDM method to provide superior accuracy compared to the other mapping-based approaches, SQC and spin-LSC, we found that it performed with equivalent accuracy compared to the AIMS benchmark results. We further explore the underpinnings of the spin-PLDM correlation function by decomposing its <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span><sup>2</sup> density matrix-focused initial conditions, where <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> is the number of states in the quantum subsystem. Finally, we found an approximate form of the spin-PLDM correlation function, which simplifies the simulation and reduces the computational costs from <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span><sup>2</sup> to <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>.</span>

# Accelerated linear algebra for large scale DFT calculations of materials on CPU/GPU architectures with CRYSTAL

## 加速线性代数，用于在具有晶体的CPU/GPU架构上对材料进行大规模DFT计算

Link: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/162/8/082501/3337057/Accelerated-linear-algebra-for-large-scale-DFT

<span class="paragraphSection">We discuss the implementation strategy, numerical accuracy, and computational performance of the acceleration of linear algebra operations through graphics processing units (GPUs) for the self-consistent field driver of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Crystal</span> electronic structure package for solid state density functional theory simulations. Accelerated tasks include matrix multiplication, diagonalization, and inversion, as well as Cholesky decomposition. The scaling of the implemented strategy over multiple accelerating devices is assessed in the range of 1–8 GPUs per node and found to be remarkably regular. Tests are performed on three systems: <span style="font-style: italic;">α</span>-quartz, a microporous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), and a giant mesoporous metal–organic framework (bio-MOF). Scaling with system size is investigated via supercells of increasing size of both <span style="font-style: italic;">α</span>-quartz and ZIF-8 (up to 648 and 2208 atoms per cell, respectively). The bio-MOF model structure has 2808 atoms per cell, with 33 672 basis functions. We test the performance of the accelerated code with both generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and hybrid GGA exchange–correlation functionals. The efficiency of the new accelerated code is compared to the previous central processing unit (CPU)-only parallelization strategies based on MPI or MPI/OpenMP within either replicated or distributed memory (i.e., massively parallel) approaches. Such a comparison highlights how the new GPU-accelerated code enables calculations on large systems at a significantly reduced computational cost relative to CPU-only strategies. For instance, we find that for the bio-MOF system, the computing time of the linear algebra tasks from a single GPU is comparable to that from the reference approach in the range of 512–1024 CPU cores and 4–8 nodes.</span>
