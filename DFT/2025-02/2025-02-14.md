Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations are crucial for understanding enzymatic reactions, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quantum-mechanical method used. Semiempirical methods offer computational efficiency but often struggle with accuracy in complex systems. This work presents a novel multi-objective evolutionary strategy for optimizing semiempirical Hamiltonians, specifically designed to enhance their performance in enzymatic QM/MM simulations while remaining broadly applicable to condensed-phase systems. Our methodology combines automated parameter optimization, targeting \textit{ab initio} or density functional theory (DFT)-reference potential energy surfaces, atomic charges, and gradients, with comprehensive validation through minimum free energy path (MFEP) calculations. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied our approach to improve the GFN2-xTB Hamiltonian using two enzymatic systems that involve hydride transfer reactions where the activation energy barrier is severely underestimated: Crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (CCR) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The optimized parameters showed significant improvements in reproducing potential and free energy surfaces, closely matching higher-level DFT calculations. Through an efficient two-stage optimization process, we first developed parameters for CCR using reaction path data, then refined these parameters for DHFR by incorporating a targeted set of additional training geometries. This strategic approach minimized the computational cost while achieving accurate descriptions of both systems, as validated through QM/MM simulations using the Adaptive String Method (ASM). Our method represents an efficient approach for optimizing semiempirical methods to study larger systems and longer timescales, with potential applications in enzymatic reaction mechanisms studies, drug design, and enzyme engineering.

The stability of Ru-based catalysts under harsh electrochemical conditions is a critical challenge limiting their practical application in energy conversion systems. In this study, Ru catalysts supported on ZrO2-x, CeO2-x, and ZrCeO2-x were synthesized via pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and systematically evaluated to elucidate the role of support interactions on catalytic performance and durability. Advanced characterization techniques, including HR-TEM, XRD, XPS, and EXAFS, revealed that Ru-ZrCeO2-x exhibited superior structural stability compared to Ru-ZrO2-x and Ru-CeO2-x, particularly under high-potential sweep (HPS) conditions. The incorporation of Ce into ZrO2-x was shown to stabilize oxygen vacancies and enhance the interaction between Ru catalyst and the support, thereby mitigating catalyst degradation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirmed that Ce doping decreases formation energy of the oxygen vacancy, providing a thermodynamically favorable environment for Ru stabilization. This work demonstrates the promise of ZrCeO2-x as a robust support material for Ru-based catalysts, advancing their potential for durable and efficient energy applications.

# Impact of octahedral aluminium sites on guest molecule adsorption in zeolites: A computational study of 5-fluorouracil in zeolite FAU

Many aluminosilicate zeolites contain octahedral aluminium sites, which may occur as extra-framework or framework-associated sites. Due to the Lewis acidity of these sites, their impact on catalytic properties has been investigated frequently. Comparatively less emphasis has been placed on their role in adsorption, despite evidence for an irreversible binding of some guest molecules like the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to octahedral Al atoms. In the present study, dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations and DFT-based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) are employed to investigate the adsorption of 5-FU at a framework-associated octahedral Al site in zeolite FAU. The calculations show that 5-FU remains coordinated to the Al atom at room temperature and in the presence of water. In contrast, 5-FU molecules adsorbed at framework protons are quickly displaced by water molecules. It is thus demonstrated that octahedral Al atoms will negatively affect the release of 5-FU from zeolite hosts in drug delivery applications. A comparison of DFT-calculated infrared (IR) spectra to literature data provides evidence that Al-coordinated 5 FU molecules were indeed present in previously investigated samples.

# Scalable route to N-trifluoromethyl amides via radical trifluoromethylamination

## 通过自由基三氟甲基胺化获得N-三氟甲基酰胺的可扩展路线

N-CF3 amides are promising targets for medicinal and agrochemistry. However, they have not yet been practically applied because of the limitations of their synthetic method. Traditional amidation can not be utilized to prepare N-CF3 amides due to the unavailability of corresponding N-CF3 amines. The development of effective alternative route has become a research focus in this field. We describe here a conceptually novel trifluoromethylamination method, in which the reactivity of trifluoromethylamidyl radicals derived from N-(N-CF3 imidoyloxy) pyridinium salts can be harnessed for the rapid construction of diverse N-CF3 amides. Such stable imidoyloxy pyridinium salts are conveniently prepared by the imidoylation of pyridine-N-oxide with the in situ formed N-CF3 nitrilium ions. The ensuing pyridinium fragmentation under photoredox catalysis liberates trifluoromethylimidoyloxy radical, which can efficiently participate in the trifluoromethylaminations of (hetero)arenes, alkenes and functionalized alkenes, alkynes, silylenol ethers, and isocyanides in the form of trifluoromethylamidyl radical through imidoyloxy-amidyl resonance. Density functional theory calculations indicate that although initial charge distribution and spin density of key radical intermediates in the optimized structure are not conducive to the reaction at the N-site, the trifluoromethylamidyl radical can be dynamically activated when approaching the reactant, thereby selectively serves as an effective radical aminating reagent for subsequent C-N coupling reactions. The tolerance of the reaction to steric and electronic factors has allowed for the synthesis of the most diverse set of N-CF3 amides and their cyclic derivatives.
