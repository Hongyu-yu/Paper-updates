# Discovery of a new phase in thin flakes of KV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ under pressure

Abstract: We report results of magnetotransport measurements on KV$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes under pressure. Our zero-field electrical resistance reveals an additional anomaly emerging under pressure ($p$), marking a previously unidentified phase boundary $T^{\rm \ast}$($p$). Together with the established $T_{\rm CDW}(p)$ and $T_c(p)$, denoting the charge-density-wave transition and a superconducting transition, respectively, the temperature-pressure phase diagram of KV$_3$Sb$_5$ features a rich interplay among multiple phases. The Hall coefficient evolves reasonably smoothly when crossing the $T^{\rm \ast}$ phase boundary compared with the variation when crossing $T_{\rm CDW}$, indicating the preservation of the pristine electronic structure. The mobility spectrum analysis provides further insights into distinguishing different phases. Finally, our high-pressure quantum oscillation studies up to 31 T combined with density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the new phase does not reconstruct the Fermi surface, confirming that the translational symmetry of the pristine metallic state is preserved.

# Optimizing Lead-Free Chalcogenide Perovskites for High-Efficiency Photovoltaics via Alloying Strategies

## 通过合金化策略优化用于高效光伏的无铅硫族化物钙钛矿

Abstract: Lead-free chalcogenide perovskites are emerging as game-changers in the race for sustainable, high-performance photovoltaics. These materials offer a perfect trifecta: non-toxic elemental composition, exceptional phase stability, and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, unlocking their full potential for solar cell applications requires advanced strategies to fine-tune their electronic and optical behavior. In this study, we take CaHfS$_{3}$-a promising but underexplored candidate-and revolutionize its performance by introducing targeted substitutions: Ti at the cation site and Se at the anion site. Using cutting-edge computational techniques, including density functional theory, GW calculations, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we reveal how these substitutions transform the material's properties. Our findings highlight that alloyed compounds such as CaHfS$_{3-x}$Se$_{x}$ and CaHf$_{1-y}$Ti$_{y}$X$_{3}$ (X = S, Se) are not only phase-stable but also feature adjustable direct G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE bandgaps (1.29-2.67 eV), reduced exciton binding energies, and significantly improved polaron mobility. These modifications enable better light absorption, reduced electron-hole recombination, longer exciton lifetimes, and enhanced quantum yield. Impressively, the alloyed perovskites, specifically, for the Ti-rich Se-based perovskites, achieve a spectroscopic-limited maximum efficiency of up to 28.06%, outperforming traditional lead-based halide perovskites. Our results demonstrate that strategic alloying is a powerful tool to supercharge the optoelectronic properties of lead-free chalcogenide perovskites, positioning them as strong contenders for next-generation photovoltaic technologies.

Abstract: The quest for environmentally benign and stable optoelectronic materials has intensified, and chalcogenide perovskites (CPs) have emerged as promising candidates owing to their non-toxic composition, stability, small bandgaps, large absorption coefficients. However, a detailed theoretical study of excitonic and polaronic properties of these materials remains underexplored due to high computational demands. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Germanium-based CPs, AGeX$_{3}$ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se), which adopt distorted perovskite structures (\beta-phase) with an orthorhombic crystal structure (space group : Pnma) by utilizing state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body perturbation theory (GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation). Our calculations reveal that these materials are thermodynamically and mechanically stable, with the bandgaps calculated using G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE ranging from 0.646 to 2.001 eV - suitable for optoelectronic devices. We analyze the ionic and electronic contributions to dielectric screening using DFPT and BSE methods, finding that the electronic component dominates. The exciton binding energies range from 0.03 to 73.63 meV, indicating efficient exciton dissociation under ambient conditions. Additionally, these perovskites exhibit low to high polaronic mobilities (1.67-167.65 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$), exceeding many lead-free CPs and halide perovskites due to reduced carrier-phonon interactions. The unique combination of wide tunable bandgaps, low exciton binding energies, and enhanced charge-carrier mobility highlights AGeX$_{3}$ as a potential material for next-generation optoelectronic applications. These compounds are stable, high-performing, and eco-friendly, showing great promise for experimental realization and device integration.

Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.

# Defluorinative Coupling of (NH)-Heteroarenes and Unactivated Vinyl Fluorides Enabled by Metal–Organic Frameworks

## 金属有机骨架使 (NH)-杂芳烃和未活化的乙烯基氟化物脱氟偶联

**Authors:** Julia, Pitolaj

N-vinyl azoles are prevalent moieties in pharmaceuticals, and fluorovinyl groups are widely recognized as carbonyl bi-oisosteres in drug design. Thus, N-fluorovinylated heteroarenes represent highly desirable functional groups in medicinal chemistry. To streamline the development of novel N-fluorovinylation and N-pentafluoropropenylation reactions, herein we safely handle fluorinated gases, such as vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and hexafluoropropene (HFP), as solid reagents using a metal–organic framework (MOF), Mg2(dobdc) (dobdc4− = 2,5-dioxidobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate). Free (NH)-heteroarenes react directly with VDF via a defluorinative pathway under mild conditions, yielding terminal N-fluorovinylated products. Various complex, biologically active molecules smoothly undergo N-fluorovinylation under these conditions in much higher yields than with the gas alone. Mechanistic investigations, including deuterium incorpo-ration experiments and density functional theory calculations, suggest that this transformation represents a rare example of a concerted nucleophilic vinylic substitution (SNV) process. This protocol can be performed on gram scale, and the resulting N-fluorovinyl moieties can be further diversified to yield valuable motifs, such as N-fluorocyclopropyl groups. Finally, this defluorinative coupling can be generalized to other fluorinated alkene gases, such as HFP. Overall, this robust defluorinative coupling offers a straightforward strategy for synthesizing diverse fluorinated heteroarenes from readily available starting materials, providing broad access to these valuable motifs for the first time.
