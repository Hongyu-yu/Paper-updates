Abstract: In this study, we present a theoretical and computational investigation of the atomic-scale structure of the heterointerface formed between the (001) surface of $L1_0$-ordered iron palladium (FePd) alloy and graphene (Gr), namely, $L1_0$-FePd(001)/Gr. Using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the topmost surface layer consisting of Pd (Pd-terminated surface) becomes more energetically stable than Fe, and Pd-terminated surfaces are not conducive to Gr adsorption. On the other hand, under oxygen atmosphere conditions, our calculation suggests the presence of Fe-terminated surfaces with Gr-covered structures reproducing recent experimental observations; besides, the presence of Fe-O bonds by the surface oxidization is also consistent with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings are crucial for understanding the fabrication processes of interfaces in Fe-based $L1_0$ alloy materials.

# Dependence of the energy and orbital structure of local states in CuO monolayer on Coulomb parameters

Abstract: The dependence of the energies and orbital structure of local states in the CuO monolayer on intra- and interatomic Coulomb interactions on copper and oxygen orbitals is studied. The electronic system is described within the eight-band p-d model in the hole representation with the on-site energies and hopping integrals obtained using density functional theory. CuO cluster multiparticle eigenstates are calculated using exact diagonalization. The difference between the energy dependencies on the Coulomb parameters for the states with the predominant probability density on the d-orbital and the states in which hole occupies p-orbitals leads to crossover of d- and p-states. The ground single-hole and two-hole states which determine the electronic structure of the low-energy excitations have the character of d- or p-orbitals in the different regions of the Coulomb parameters space. The gap between the energies of the dispersionless quasiparticles forming the top of the valence band and conductivity band also have different values in these two regions. The magnitude of this gap and the orbital character of the local multiparticle states change sharply even with an insignificant change in the Coulomb interactions within the boundary region of parameters between the regions in which the local states are formed by the d- or p-orbitals.

# Grain Boundary Segregation and Embrittlement of Aluminum Binary Alloys from First Principles

Abstract: Grain boundary segregation controls properties of polycrystalline materials such as their susceptibility to intergranular cracking. It is of interest to engineer alloy chemistry to enhance grain boundary cohesion to prevent intergranular failure. While there is collectively a large first-principles dataset for grain boundary embrittlement in multiple Al-based binary alloys, the methodologies used for the first principles calculations, as well as the analyzed fracture paths, are variable amongst studies. Here, we reevaluate and compute grain boundary segregation and embrittlement from all-electron first-principles for the {\Sigma}5[001](210) Al grain boundary. We explicitly evaluate multiple fracture paths, and provide a study case of the chemical trends of the preferred fracture paths across 69 binary Al alloys. The results suggest that neglecting certain low energy fracture paths can lead to errors of estimating embrittlement potency up to the order of 1 eV per solute atom, especially for multiple d-block transition metal solutes that are of engineering interest. The database calculated here also permits a comprehensive comparison between all-electron and pseudopotential methodologies. The effects of Hubbard U density functional theory on grain boundary segregation and embrittlement in Al(Sc) are found not to be significant in terms of the relative energetic calculations of grain boundaries and free surfaces (differences are of order 0.1 eV or less).

Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit unique properties, expanding opportunities in material design. We investigate MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) in homo- and heterobilayers with different stacking and twist angles. Twisted bilayers introduce Moir\'e patterns, significantly altering electronic properties. Using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) with range-separated hybrid functionals, we examine 30 MX$_2$ combinations, revealing how stacking and composition influence stability and band gap energy (E$_g$). Notably, the MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure with a 60\textdegree~shift maintains a direct band gap, highlighting its potential for applications. Homobilayers under low-strain conditions exhibit diverse stacking-dependent electronic behaviors, where MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$ transition between direct and indirect band gaps at specific twist angles. MoS$_2$ can even switch between semiconductor and metallic states. Critical twist angles (17.9\textdegree, 42.1\textdegree, 77.9\textdegree, and 102.1\textdegree) in twisted WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ bilayers yield symmetric Moir\'e patterns with tunable band gaps. Our findings emphasize that controlling heterostructures and twist angles is a powerful strategy for engineering electronic properties, offering a pathway for next-generation materials.

# Unraveling-induced entanglement phase transition in diffusive trajectories of continuously monitored noninteracting fermionic systems

Abstract: The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.

Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.

# Quasi-aperiodic grain boundary phases of {\Sigma}5 tilt grain boundaries in refractory metals

Abstract: We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.

Abstract: In this contribution, we give an overview of the ELPA library and ELSI interface, which are crucial elements for large-scale electronic structure calculations in FHI-aims.
  ELPA is a key solver library that provides efficient solutions for both standard and generalized eigenproblems, which are central to the Kohn-Sham formalism in density functional theory (DFT). It supports CPU and GPU architectures, with full support for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, and ongoing development for Intel GPUs. Here we also report the results of recent optimizations, leading to significant improvements in GPU performance for the generalized eigenproblem.
  ELSI is an open-source software interface layer that creates a well-defined connection between "user" electronic structure codes and "solver" libraries for the Kohn-Sham problem, abstracting the step between Hamilton and overlap matrices (as input to ELSI and the respective solvers) and eigenvalues and eigenvectors or density matrix solutions (as output to be passed back to the "user" electronic structure code). In addition to ELPA, ELSI supports solvers including LAPACK and MAGMA, the PEXSI and NTPoly libraries (which bypass an explicit eigenvalue solution), and several others.

Abstract: We present the theory, implementation, and benchmarking of a real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) module within the RMG code, designed to simulate the electronic response of molecular systems to external perturbations. Our method offers insights into non-equilibrium dynamics and excited states across a diverse range of systems, from small organic molecules to large metallic nanoparticles. Benchmarking results demonstrate excellent agreement with established TDDFT implementations and showcase the superior stability of our time-integration algorithm, enabling long-term simulations with minimal energy drift. The scalability and efficiency of RMG on massively parallel architectures allow for simulations of complex systems, such as plasmonic nanoparticles with thousands of atoms. Future extensions, including nuclear and spin dynamics, will broaden the applicability of this RT-TDDFT implementation, providing a powerful toolset for studies of photoactive materials, nanoscale devices, and other systems where real-time electronic dynamics is essential.

# Atomic-Scale Observation of Moiré potential in Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers by Electron Microscopy

## 通过电子显微镜观察扭曲的六方氮化硼层中的莫尔电位

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hbbfj-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Masahiro, Ehara

Moiré superlattices (MSLs) are an emerging class of two-dimensional functional materials whose electronic states can be tuned by the twist angle between two van der Waals layers and/or the relative placement of the layers. The intriguing prop-erties of MSLs are closely correlated to the moiré potential, which is the electrostatic potential induced by interlayer cou-pling. Intensive efforts have been made to understand the nature and distribution of the moiré potential by using various experimental and theoretical techniques. However, the experimental observation of the moiré potential is still challenging because of the possible presence of the surface and/or interlayer contaminants. In this work, we develop a method to obtain hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanolayers (with or without twist) using a specially designed chemical exfoliation tech-nique. The resulting hBN nanolayers are atomically clean and strain free, hence providing ideal MSLs for the investigation of their moiré potential. Aberration-corrected high resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements on the twisted hBN nanolayers allow us to observe moiré diffraction spots in Fourier space. Then, the moiré potential is recon-structed by the inverse fast Fourier transform of the moiré diffraction spots. It has been revealed that the local interlayer atomic overlap plays a decisive role in determining the periodicity and distribution of the moiré potential, as supported by density functional theory calculations. This work not only provides a general strategy to observe the moiré potential in MSLs, but it also expands the application of electron microscopy to the further study of MSLs with atomic resolution.

**Authors:** Laura, Gagliardi

The discovery of novel molecular systems for quantum information processing remains a major challenge for advancing molecular qubit technology. In the realm of optically addressable systems, a previously synthesized and characterized Cr(IV) pseudo-tetrahedral complex, featuring four strongly donating o-tolyl ligands surrounding the chromium center, has demonstrated potential as a qubit candidate. This study proposes analogs of this complex through a metal substitution strategy, extending the investigation to new complexes. The new metal centers were selected from first-row and Group 6 transition metals.  Multiconfigurational methods such as the complete active space followed by second-order perturbation theory and multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory were utilized to calculate energy gaps between electronic states with different spins and zero-field splitting (ZFS). The results corroborate previous experimental findings for the Cr complex. Additionally, this study identifies a previously unsynthesized Ti(II) compound as a promising candidate for molecular qubits. This finding highlights the role of computational multireference methods in the rational design of qubit systems.

**Authors:** Patrick, Kouotou Mountapmbeme

This study reports the synthesis of three sets of high-performance Mn-doped Co3O4 porous nanocrystals (PNCs) (5%Mn@Co3O4, 10%Mn@Co3O4, and 15%Mn@Co3O4) using a simple chemical co-precipitation method. These catalysts were then applied to the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO). The investigation focused on the effects of Co2+ or Co3+ substitution by Mn2+ or Mn3+ within the Co3O4 matrix on various properties, including physiochemical characteristics, morphology, microstructure, reducibility, thermal stability, as well as their impact on catalytic performance. Comprehensive characterization techniques, including XRD, SEM, BET, XPS, H2-TPR, and DRIFT, were employed to elucidate the underlying factors responsible for effective CO oxidation. Compared to pure Mn3O4 and Co3O4, the Mn@Co3O4 PNCs catalyst exhibited a more controllable microstructure and a better dispersion of the active phase. The 5%Mn@Co3O4 catalyst demonstrated the highest activity, achieving 90% CO oxidation at 197 °C. This superior performance is attributed to its large specific surface area, excellent reduction capacity, and abundant oxygen species and vacancies. H2-TPR and XPS analysis provided further insights into the reaction mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the formation of oxygen bulk vacancies is more favorable for when Mn dopants occupy Co2+ sites. Overall, the chemical co-precipitation method offers a straightforward and cost-effective approach for producing Mn@Co3O4 catalysts suitable for CO abatement in exhaust and flue gases

# DFT-Based Insights into Ga₆N₆ Nanoring for Pollutant Gas Sensing: Adsorption Energetics and Electronic Modulations

## 基于DFT的对用于污染物气体传感的ga ₆n ₆ Nanoring的见解: 吸附能量学和电子调制

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5921864/latest

Environmental pollution, a pressing global concern, is primarily caused by the release of harmful gases. These gases, such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2), significantly contribute to climate change, environmental degradation, and adverse health effects. To address this issue, the development of advanced materials, particularly nanomaterials with their large surface area and active sites, is crucial for detecting and reducing these pollutants. The present study investigated the interaction between toxic gas molecules and a Ga6N6 nanoring using density functional theory. The results, with adsorption energies are 2.09 eV, -1.75 eV, -2.04 eV and -1.01 eV, revealed strong binding between the nanoring and CO2, NO, NO2 and SO2 gas molecules, respectively, indicating a promising potential for sensing and removing these gases. &amp;nbsp;However, the interactions with CO and NH3 were weaker, suggesting that Ga6N6 &amp;nbsp;nanoring may not be well-suited for detecting these gases. Based on the recovery time analysis, the Ga6N6 nanoring shows potential for storing or removing CO2, NO, NO2 and SO2 gas molecules from a specific environment. Due to longer recovery time, the nanoring can effectively bind and hold these gas molecules, making it a promising candidate for environmental remediation applications.
