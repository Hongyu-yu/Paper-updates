Identification of the true catalytically active species/sites
holds the key to new catalyst design. In this study, combination of complementary operando surface/bulk sensitive spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations establish a clear picture of the structure-activity relations in marcasite- and pyrite-type CoSe2 for overall water splitting. Our results reveal that
under acidic conditions marcasite CoSe2 undergoes slight surface corrosion, producing disordered [CoSe6] motifs with the active Se sites for catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In contrast, during the alkaline HER, the marcasite CoSe2 initially interacts with the electrolyte to reconstruct an O-rich covered surface, which
subsequently undergoes potential-driven restructuring to generate the metallic cobalt species as the true active species. Such dynamic changes of the active species/sites along with variations in pH values were not observed in pyrite CoSe2, either with or without heteroatom substitution, highlighting the significant importance of phase engineering in managing the HER kinetics. Further operando spectroelectrochemical monitoring demonstrates that the in situ generation of highly disordered Co4+ species is a common denominator of CoSe2 catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study directly evidences the dynamic influence of local coordination geometries of the catalytic active centers on the underlying catalytic reaction kinetics.

Strontium titanate (SrTiO3 or STO) is one of the promising photocatalysts for sustainable energy applications. Using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we herein study the structural and electronic factors contributing to its high photocatalytic activity and facet dependence. The constrained DFT method revealed that the hole polarons in bulk and surface STO are localized primarily on oxygen atoms. In contrast, electron polarons in bulk STO tend to delocalize over oxygen atoms unless stabilized by oxygen vacancies. The stability of hole polarons is higher at the surface O site of the (110) surface compared to the (001) surfaces. In addition, the oxygen vacancy is stable specifically at the TiO2-terminated (001) surface. These findings provide an atomic-level insight into the relationship between polaron stability and facet dependence of photocatalysis, paving the way for the design of more efficient STO-based photocatalysts.

We used density functional theory simulations in combination with ab initio thermodynamics to determine the H2 partial pressure (p_("H" _"2"  )) dependent energetics associated with H2 activation and recovery at various defect sites in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). We found that some defects are very reactive with hydrogen thereby definitely trapping hydrogen in defective h-BN. However, depending on hydrogen partial pressure, less reactive defect sites can be populated. Because of the lower binding capability of these sites, they would allow for hydrogen to be recycled and recovered. For small defect sizes, we found that hydrogen preferentially bind to nitrogen sites by forming N—H bonds, and if no N sites are available then boron sites would be the next to bind hydrogen. Hydrogen dissociation via Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) is found to be more favorable than forming only N—H bonds but only if the defect size is large enough to accommodate steric effects. For specific conditions such as T= 400 K, p_("H" _"2"  )=1 bar, and only considering one molecular H2 per defect, three defects, namely the N monovacancy, 3V(1B2N), and hexagonal 6V(3B3N) could play a role in both the activation and recycling of H2, as they would be reacting enough to allow a favorable splitting of H2 while not binding too strongly to allow its recovery. More broadly, a range of p_("H" _"2"  ) and hydrogen loading conditions were investigated for different types of defects and the finding suggests that p_("H" _"2"  ) could be used to fine tune the Gibbs free energy of hydrogenation, thereby allowing several types of defects at different hydrogen loading content to play a role in the activation/recovery process of H2 in defective h-BN.
