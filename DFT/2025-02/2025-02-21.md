<span class="paragraphSection">In our previous work [Mondal <span style="font-style: italic;">et al.</span>, J. Chem. Phys. <strong>162</strong>, 014114 (2025)], we developed several efficient computational approaches to simulate exciton–polariton dynamics described by the Holstein–Tavis–Cummings (HTC) Hamiltonian under the collective coupling regime. Here, we incorporated these strategies into the previously developed Lindblad-partially linearized density matrix (L-PLDM) approach for simulating 2D electronic spectroscopy (2DES) of exciton–polariton under the collective coupling regime. In particular, we apply the efficient quantum dynamics propagation scheme developed in Paper I to both the forward and the backward propagations in the PLDM and develop an efficient importance sampling scheme and graphics processing unit vectorization scheme that allow us to reduce the computational costs from O(K2)O(T3) to O(K)O(T0) for the 2DES simulation, where K is the number of states and <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span> is the number of time steps of propagation. We further simulated the 2DES for an HTC Hamiltonian under the collective coupling regime and analyzed the signal from both rephasing and non-rephasing contributions of the ground state bleaching, excited state emission, and stimulated emission pathways.</span>

# Exploring atom-pairwise and many-body dispersion corrections for the BEEF-vdW functional

## 探索牛肉-vdW功能的原子对和多体色散校正

<span class="paragraphSection">The Bayesian error estimation functional (BEEF-vdW) is widely used in surface science and catalysis, because it provides a balanced description of molecular, surface, and solid state systems, along with reliable error estimates. However, the nonlocal van-der-Waals density functional (vdW-DF2) employed in BEEF-vdW can be computationally costly and displays relatively low accuracy for molecular systems. Therefore, this work explores whether atom-pairwise and many-body dispersion treatments represent viable alternatives to using the vdW-DF2 functional with BEEF-vdW. To this end, we investigate the performance of commonly used atom-pairwise corrections [i.e., the Tkatchenko–Scheffler (TS) and the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) approaches] and many-body dispersion (MBD) treatments for molecular, surface, and solid-state systems. The results indicate that atom-pairwise methods such as TS and particularly XDM provide a good balance of cost and accuracy across all systems.</span>

# Determining Site Requirements for Reactive Species in Multi-Site Catalysis on Metal Surfaces Using Excluded Areas

Many metal-catalyzed reactions (e.g., hydrogenolysis, (de)hydrogenation, and hydro-deoxygenation) involve reactive species with molecular volumes that extend beyond the cross-sectional areas of exposed metal atoms. The kinetic behaviors of such reactions are well described by lattice-based models that account for adsorbates occupying multiple adjacent sites (i.e., exposed metal atoms). Site requirements are often inferred from the number of metal atoms an adsorbate coordinates to, which can underpredict the number of contiguous sites that are inaccessible to co-adsorbates by lateral repulsion. Here, we instead determine adsorbate site requirements from the surface areas they exclude from co-adsorbates. These areas are determined from adsorbate structures, optimized previously using density functional theory (DFT), by projecting their molecular volumes onto the surface plane (AS) or by tracing their areas with a circular probe that represents co-adsorbates (Aenc). These excluded areas agree with those inferred from the experimentally measured saturation coverages of eight polyatomic adsorbates on Pt(111) and Ni(111). They predict a number of sites needed for ethane hydrogenolysis on Ir nanoparticles (two to three exposed Ir atoms) that is consistent with previous kinetic measurements and DFT calculations. The areas further estimate site requirements for benzene hydrogenation on Pt nanoparticles (six exposed Pt atoms) that accurately describe rate dependences on benzene pressure, under physically realistic benzene and H-adatom coverages and with adsorption enthalpies consistent with experimental benchmarks. Excluded areas therefore offer a practical and accurate way to determine site requirements in multi-site kinetic models, facilitating mechanistic studies and guiding ab initio catalyst design for reactions of bulky molecules that inevitably cover multiple contiguous surface atoms.

# HFIP Solvent Effects on Enantioselectivity of Dirhodium Tetracar-boxylate-Catalyzed Cyclopropanation

## HFIP溶剂对四羧酸二钯催化环丙烷化反应对映选择性的影响

**Authors:** Peng, Liu

In recent years, additives that modulate both reactivity and selectivity in rhodium catalyzed-reactions of aryldiazoacetaes have become increasingly prominent. 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) has been shown to have a profound effect on rhodium carbene reac-tivity and selectivity, especially on enabling carbene cyclopropanation in the presence of various nucleophilic poisons. HFIP also has a variable influence on the enantioselectivity of the reactions catalyzed by chiral dirhodium tetracarboxylates, and this study examines the fundamental properties of the rhodium carbene/HFIP system through experimentation, density functional theory (DFT), and molecu-lar dynamics (MD) simulations. These studies revealed that the C4-symmetric bowl-shaped catalysts, which have been previously consid-ered to be relatively rigid, experience far greater flexibility in this hydrogen bonding media, resulting in distortion of the bowl-shaped cata-lysts. These studies explain why even though a majority of the catalysts have a drop in enantioselectivity in HFIP, some catalysts such as Rh2(TCPTAD)4, lead to a switch in enantioselectivity, whereas others, such as Rh2(NTTL)4, lead to a considerably enhanced enantiose-lectivity.

# Regulation of Active Hydrogen and Nitrate Concentration: Pulsed Potential Strategies in Nitrate Electroreduction Microenvironments

## 活性氢和硝酸盐浓度的调节: 硝酸盐电还原微环境中的脉冲电位策略

The electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3RR) plays a significant role in the nitrogen cycle and environmental remediation. The dynamics of active hydrogen in the NO3RR were studied in depth by varying the nitrate concentration and applying a pulsed-potential approach. The effect of both factors on regulation of the degree of hydrogenation of the intermediates and the product distribution was evaluated. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that elevated nitrate levels decrease the energy barrier for *NO to *N conversion, enhancing *N2 formation. The experimental results indicate that under high nitrate concentrations, copper-palladium (CuPd) catalysts exhibit faster reaction kinetics and higher nitrogen selectivity. In-situ characterizations illuminated the critical role of active hydrogen on reaction intermediates. The CuPd catalyst achieved 95% NO3-N conversion and 99% N2 selectivity at 1 M nitrate by pulse potential modulation of the active hydrogen concentration on the catalyst surface. Finite element analysis (FEA) verified that pulsed potentials modulate the local nitrate and hydrogen ion concentrations. The present work brings the NO3RR closer to practical applications, aiding in environmental protection and the balance of the nitrogen cycle.
