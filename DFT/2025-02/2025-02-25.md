<span class="paragraphSection">Benzophenone serves as a prototype chromophore for studying the photochemistry of aromatic ketones, with applications ranging from biochemistry to organic light-emitting diodes. In particular, its intersystem crossing from the first singlet excited state to triplet states has been extensively studied, but experimental or theoretical studies on the preceding internal conversion within the singlet manifold are very rare. This relaxation mechanism is particularly important because direct population transfer of the first singlet excited state from the ground state is inefficient due to its low oscillator strength. In this work, our aim is to fill this gap by employing mixed quantum-classical and full quantum dynamics simulations and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy for gas-phase benzophenone and <span style="font-style: italic;">meta</span>-methyl benzophenone. Our results show that nonadiabatic relaxation via conical intersections leads to an increase in the population of the first singlet excited state, which appears linear within the simulation time of 500 fs. This population transfer due to conical intersections can be directly detected by a bifurcation of the photoelectron signal. In addition, we discuss to clarify the role of the third singlet excited state degenerate to the second excited state—a topic that remains largely unexplored in the existing literature on benzophenone.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection">We report two analytical quantum mechanics (QM) models for approximating appropriately scaled harmonic zero-point energies (ZPEs) without Hessian calculations. Following our earlier bond energies from bond orders and populations model that takes a similar form as an extended Hückel model but uses well-conditioned orbital populations, this work demonstrates a proof of concept for approximating ZPEs, an important component in thermochemistry calculations, while eschewing unfavorably scaling algorithms involving Hessian matrices. The ZPE-BOP1 model uses Mulliken orbital populations from hybrid Kohn–Sham density functional theory calculations within an extended Hückel-type model that defines vibrational bond energy terms using two atom-pairwise parameters that are fit to reproduce ZPEs from B3LYP calculations. The more accurate ZPE-BOP2 model uses Mulliken orbital populations from Hartree–Fock calculations within a different extended Hückel-type model that includes a short-range anharmonic energy term and a coupled three-body oscillator energy term with seven atom-pairwise parameters. Both models predict ZPEs in molecules involving first row elements, but ZPE-BOP2 outperforms ZPE-BOP1 in strained and long-chain molecules and provides ZPEs more competitive with those from semi-empirical QM methods (e.g., AM1, PM6, PM7, and XTB-2) that compute ZPEs with Hessian calculations. This work shows progress and an outlook toward computational models that use well-conditioned orbital populations to efficiently predict useful physicochemical properties. It also shows opportunities for approximate QM models that would shift traditional computational bottlenecks away from costly algorithms such as Hessian calculations to others that focus on reliable orbital populations.</span>

Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) compounds are added to tire rubber at percent levels to sacrificially react with oxidants for prolonged service life. Recently, the PPD transformation product N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N’-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone (6PPDQ) has been identified in roadway runoff as a potent toxicant for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). As 6PPD may be phased out in favour of alternative PPDs, understanding the physicochemical properties of their corresponding quinones is important for predicting their environmental fate, distribution, and toxicity. Here, we present experimentally determined water solubility values for 6PPDQ and five structural analogues and find them to be several orders of magnitude lower than those predicted by EPI Suite, a popular Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) program. We also report octanol-water and air-water partition coefficients for PPDQs using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and QSAR approaches. Both methods provided similar rank ordering of compounds. However, DFT methods tended to underestimate log Kow values and overestimate log Kaw values relative to EPI Suite. We discuss the strengths and limitations of both computational approaches, the need for more experimentally derived values, and caution researchers interpreting predicted physicochemical properties, particularly for emerging contaminants for which QSARs may be poorly parameterized.

# Antiparallel to Parallel β-Sheet Transition of Amyloid-β is Promoted by the Ability to Incor-porate into Membranes

**Authors:** Ronja Rabea, Paschke

Alzheimer's disease is closely associated with the misfolding of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides towards β-sheet-rich fibrils. Increasing evidence suggests that early-stage Aβ oligomers formed along the misfolding trajectory exert neurodegenerative effects by interfering with neuronal membranes eventually leading to cellular dysfunction. However, the mechanism and factors influencing these early events – particularly how the lipid membrane modulates the structural polymorphism of Aβ – remain debated. Herein, we use the enhanced plasmonic detection of surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to ask the question whether interfacial or transmembrane interactions alter the early stages of Aβ misfolding. Focusing on Aβ’s amide bands, we track the secondary structural changes when Aβ interacts with tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) that either permit or prevent transmembrane incorporation, and quantify β-sheet fractions and orientations by comparison to computed spectra from density functional theory (DFT). We find that the incorporation of Aβ into membranes promotes the transition from antiparallel to parallel β-sheets, which are formed suddenly after a lag period indicating a cooperative process. The latter appears to be accelerated by negatively charged lipids, which are often discussed as a misfolding catalyst. Our results strengthen the proposals that misfolding involves the formation of ion channel/pore-like oligomeric structures.
