A two-phase synthesis has been well established for achieving precise control of nanoparticle properties. However, studying and understanding chemical transformation in such a spatially heterogeneous system is challenging. In this work, we introduce a two-phase synthesis route for ZnS nanoparticles (ZnS NPs) at the water-toluene interface. By employing spatially resolved in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD-XAS) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we track the diffusion of Zn²⁺ species at the interface, identify key reaction intermediates, and monitor the nucleation and growth of ZnS NPs within the toluene phase. We propose the formation of a [Zn(H2O)¬6]2+ complex upon dissolving Zn(Ac)2 in water and the diffusion of Zn2+ ions from water to toluene driven by the formation of an octahedral [Zn(OA)6]2+ complex (OA = oleylamine). Furthermore, by complementing HERFD-XAS with total X-ray scattering analysis, we show the formation of an intermediate tetrahedral [Zn(SR)4]2+ complex at 60 °C and its successive transformation to non-crystalline ZnS nuclei at 80 °C and crystalline ZnS NPs starting at 100 °C. Thus, we demonstrate how in situ X-ray spectroscopy can elucidate the coordination and diffusion of Zn²⁺ ions, and, in combination with X-ray scattering studies, identify the emergence of atomic and electronic structures during the two-phase synthesis of ZnS nanoparticles.

Fluorapatite (FAp, nominally Ca10(PO4)6F2) has been identified as an important host-material for rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) in marine sediments. REY can be accommodated in either the larger 6+3 coordinated Ca1 site or the smaller 6+1 coordinated Ca2 site, yet little is known about the site preference of REY through the lanthanide series despite its importance for understanding REY enrichment processes in FAp. Theoretical investigations based on density functional theory (DFT) predict that all REY intrinsically prefer the smaller and more ionic Ca2 site. The Ca2 site preference is less pronounced when the excess of positive charge resulting from the REY3+ for Ca2+ substitution is compensated by a coupled Na+ for Ca2+ substitution, instead of the energetically more favorable Si4+ for P5+ coupled substitution. The site preference varies quadratically with the ionic radius of REY and linearly with the sum of their first and second ionization energies. The quadratic shape of the site preference is similar to the shape of Onuma diagrams, which suggests that the local effective elastic constant of the site controls the site preference, rather than the nominal size of the site. Despite being smaller, the Ca2 site has a lower effective elastic constant, and is, therefore, more flexible than the Ca1 site for accommodating larger and smaller trivalent REY cations. Concentration-dependent computations show that REY clustering is thermodynamically favorable, except for Yb and Lu.
