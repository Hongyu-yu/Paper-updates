Abstract: We explore the impact of introducing IIIA-group element Ga in place of IIB-group element Zn in binary intermetallic GdZn on its magnetic and magnetocaloric properties, as well as explicate the modified electronic band structure of the compound. The magnetic transition temperature of the compound decreases with the increase of Ga concentration in GdZn1-xGax (x = 0-0.1) while the crystal structure (CsCl-prototype) and lattice parameters remain unchanged. Our detailed analysis of magnetization and magnetocaloric data conclusively proves that long-ranged magnetic ordering exists in the sample, despite the magnetic interaction considerably weakening with the increase of Ga. The experimental data is rationalized using both theoretical machine learning model and first-principle density functional theory.The electronic band structure of GdZn is manifested with some unusual complex features which gradually diminish with Ga doping and conventional sinusoidal feature of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya- Yosida (RKKY)-type interactions also disappears. A mean-field theory model is developed and can successfully describe the overall magnetocaloric behavior of the GdZn1-xGax series of samples

Abstract: We conducted a first-principles study of the dielectric properties of liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) using a recently developed chemical bond-based machine learning (ML) model for dipole moments [T. Amano et al. Phys. Rev. B 110, 165159 (2024)]. The ML dipole models successfully predict the dipole moment of various liquid configurations in close agreement with DFT calculations and generate $20 \mathrm{ns}$ quantum-accuracy dipole moment trajectories to calculate the dielectric function, when combined with ML potentials. The calculated dielectric function of PG closely matches experimental results. We identified a libration peak at $600\, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and an intermolecular mode at $100\, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, previously noted experimentally. Furthermore, the models trained on PG2 training data can apply to longer chain PPG not included in the training data. The present research marks the first step toward developing a universal bond-based dipole model.

arXiv:2410.22828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the realm of crystalline materials has witnessed a surge in the development of generative models, predominantly aimed at the inverse design of crystals with tailored physical properties. However, spatial symmetry, which serves as a significant inductive bias, is often not optimally harnessed in the design process. This oversight tends to result in crystals with lower symmetry, potentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional materials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of SLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and generation have shown that SLICES-PLUS exhibits greater sensitivity and robustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES. Furthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we have demonstrated its exceptional capability to target specific physical properties and crystal systems with precision. Finally, we explore autoregressive generation towards multiple elastic properties in few-shot learning. Our research represents a significant step forward in the realm of computational materials discovery.

# When can classical neural networks represent quantum states?

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23152

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2410.23152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A naive classical representation of an n-qubit state requires specifying exponentially many amplitudes in the computational basis. Past works have demonstrated that classical neural networks can succinctly express these amplitudes for many physically relevant states, leading to computationally powerful representations known as neural quantum states. What underpins the efficacy of such representations? We show that conditional correlations present in the measurement distribution of quantum states control the performance of their neural representations. Such conditional correlations are basis dependent, arise due to measurement-induced entanglement, and reveal features not accessible through conventional few-body correlations often examined in studies of phases of matter. By combining theoretical and numerical analysis, we demonstrate how the state's entanglement and sign structure, along with the choice of measurement basis, give rise to distinct patterns of short- or long-range conditional correlations. Our findings provide a rigorous framework for exploring the expressive power of neural quantum states.

# Certified algorithms for quantum Hamiltonian learning via energy-entropy inequalities

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2410.23284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the Hamiltonian of a quantum system from estimates of Gibbs-state expectation values. Various methods for achieving this task were proposed recently, both from a practical and theoretical point of view. On the one hand, some practical algorithms have been implemented and used to analyze experimental data but these algorithms often lack correctness guarantees or fail to scale to large systems. On the other hand, theoretical algorithms with provable asymptotic efficiency guarantees have been proposed, but they seem challenging to implement. Recently, a semidefinite family of Hamiltonian learning algorithms was proposed which was numerically demonstrated to scale well into the 100-qubit regime, but provided no provable accuracy guarantees. We build on this work in two ways, by extending it to provide certified a posteriori lower and upper bounds on the parameters to be learned, and by proving a priori convergence in the special case where the Hamiltonian is commuting.

# Noise-augmented Chaotic Ising Machines for Combinatorial Optimization and Sampling

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2408.04744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ising machines, hardware accelerators for combinatorial optimization and probabilistic sampling problems, have gained significant interest recently. A key element is stochasticity, which enables a wide exploration of configurations, thereby helping avoid local minima. Here, we refine the previously proposed concept of coupled chaotic bits (c-bits) that operate without explicit stochasticity. We show that augmenting chaotic bits with stochasticity enhances performance in combinatorial optimization, achieving algorithmic scaling comparable to probabilistic bits (p-bits). We first demonstrate that c-bits follow the quantum Boltzmann law in a 1D transverse field Ising model. We then show that c-bits exhibit critical dynamics similar to stochastic p-bits in 2D Ising and 3D spin glass models, with promising potential to solve challenging optimization problems. Finally, we propose a noise-augmented version of coupled c-bits via the adaptive parallel tempering algorithm (APT). Our noise-augmented c-bit algorithm outperforms fully deterministic c-bits running versions of the simulated annealing algorithm. Other analog Ising machines with coupled oscillators could draw inspiration from the proposed algorithm. Running replicas at constant temperature eliminates the need for global modulation of coupling strengths. Mixing stochasticity with deterministic c-bits creates a powerful hybrid computing scheme that can bring benefits in scaled, asynchronous, and massively parallel hardware implementations.

arXiv:2407.04930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For real-world complex system constantly enduring perturbation, to achieve survival goal in changing yet unknown environments, the central problem is constantly adapting themself to external environments according to environmental feedback. Such adaptability is considered the nature of general intelligence. Inspired by thermodynamics, we develop a self-adaptive network utilizing only macroscopic information to achieve desired landscape through reconfiguring itself in unknown environments. By continuously estimating environment entropy, our network can adaptively realize desired landscape represented by topological measures. Our network achieves adaptation under several scenarios, including confinement on phase space and geographic constraint. A unique power law distinguishes our network from memoryless systems. Furthermore, our simple strategy could enable brain network and communication network to adaptively maintain essential topological characteristics. Compared to data-driven methods, our self-adaptive network is understandable without careful choice of learning architectures and parameters. Our self-adaptive network could help to understand adaptive intelligence through the lens of thermodynamics.

# Quantum Boltzmann machine learning of ground-state energies

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2410.12935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a novel quantum circuit construction that combines classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test, thus overcoming a key obstacle to quantum Boltzmann machine learning that has been left open since [Amin et al., Phys. Rev. X 8, 021050 (2018)]. Additionally supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2410.22528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine-learning non-contact method to determine the temperature of a laser gain medium via its laser emission with a trained few-layer neural net model is presented. The training of the feed-forward Neural Network (NN) enables the prediction of the device's properties solely from spectral data, here recorded by visible-/nearinfrared-light compact micro-spectrometers for both a diode pump laser and optically-pumped gain membrane of a semiconductor disk laser. Fiber spectrometers are used for the acquisition of large quantities of labelled intensity data, which can afterwards be used for the prediction process. Such pretrained deep NNs enable a fast, reliable and easy way to infer the temperature of a laser system such as our Membrane External Cavity Laser, at a later monitoring stage without the need of additional optical diagnostics or read-out temperature sensors. With the miniature mobile spectrometer and the remote detection ability, the temperature inference capability can be adapted for various laser diodes using transfer learning methods with pretrained models. Here, mean-square-error values for the temperature inference corresponding to sub-percent accuracy of our sensor scheme are reached, while computational cost can be saved by reducing the network depth at the here displayed cost of accuracy, as appropriate for different application scenarios.

# A physics-aware data-driven surrogate approach for fast atmospheric radiative transfer inversion

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2410.22609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) was selected in 2019 as the ninth Earth Explorer mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). Its primary objective is to collect interferometric measurements in the Far-InfraRed (FIR) spectral range, which accounts for 50\% of Earth's outgoing longwave radiation emitted into space, and will be observed from space for the first time. Accurate measurements of the FIR at the top of the atmosphere are crucial for improving climate models. Current instruments are insufficient, necessitating the development of advanced computational techniques. To ensure the quality of the mission data, an End-to-End Simulator (E2ES) was developed to simulate the measurement process and evaluate the effects of instrument characteristics and environmental factors. The core challenge of the mission is solving the retrieval problem, which involves estimating atmospheric properties from the radiance spectra observed by the satellite. This problem is ill-posed and regularization techniques are necessary. In this work, we present a novel and fast data-driven approach to approximate the inverse mapping. In the first phase, we generate an initial approximation of the inverse mapping using only simulated FORUM data. In the second phase, we improve this approximation by introducing climatological data as a priori information and using a neural network to estimate the optimal regularization parameters. While our approach does not match the precision of full-physics retrieval methods, its key advantage is the ability to deliver results almost instantaneously, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. Furthermore, the proposed method can provide more accurate a priori estimates for full-physics methods, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the retrieved atmospheric profiles.

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2410.22801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited-state molecular dynamics (ESMD) simulations near conical intersections (CIs) pose significant challenges when using machine learning potentials (MLPs). Although MLPs have gained recognition for their integration into mixed quantum-classical (MQC) methods, such as trajectory surface hopping (TSH), and their capacity to model correlated electron-nuclear dynamics efficiently, difficulties persist in managing nonadiabatic dynamics. Specifically, singularities at CIs and double-valued coupling elements result in discontinuities that disrupt the smoothness of predictive functions. Partial solutions have been provided by learning diabatic Hamiltonians with phaseless loss functions to these challenges. However, a definitive method for addressing the discontinuities caused by CIs and double-valued coupling elements has yet to be developed. Here, we introduce the phaseless coupling term, $\Delta^2$, derived from the square of the off-diagonal elements of the diabatic Hamiltonian in the SSR(2,2) formalism. This approach improves the stability and accuracy of the MLP model by addressing the issues arising from CI singularities and double-valued coupling functions. We apply this method to the penta-2,4-dieniminium cation (PSB3), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving MLP training for ML-based nonadiabatic dynamics. Our results show that the $\Delta^2$ based ML-ESMD method can reproduce ab initio ESMD simulations, underscoring its potential and efficiency for broader applications, particularly in large-scale and long-timescale ESMD simulations.

arXiv:2410.22849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal measurements of water surface elevation (water waves) in laboratory experiments are essential for scientific and engineering research. Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limited wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges a novel method was developed, using polarization filter equipped camera as the main sensor and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for data processing [1,2]. The developed method training and evaluation was based on in-house made supervised dataset. Here we present this supervised dataset of polarimetric images of the water surface coupled with the water surface elevation measurements made by a linear array of resistance-type wave gauges (WG). The water waves were mechanically generated in a laboratory waves basin, and the polarimetric images were captured under an artificial light source. Meticulous camera and WGs calibration and instruments synchronization supported high spatio-temporal resolution. The data set covers several wavefield conditions, from simple monochromatic wave trains of various steepness, to irregular wavefield of JONSWAP prescribed spectral shape and several wave breaking scenarios. The dataset contains measurements repeated in several camera positions relative to the wave field propagation direction.

# Differentiable Conservative Radially Symmetric Fluid Simulations and Stellar Winds -- jf1uids

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2410.23093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present jf1uids, a one-dimensional fluid solver that can, by virtue of a geometric formulation of the Euler equations, model radially symmetric fluid problems in a conservative manner, i.e., without losing mass or energy. For spherical problems, such as ideal supernova explosions or stellar wind-blown bubble expansions, simulating only along a radial dimension drastically reduces compute and memory demands compared to a full three-dimensional method. This simplification also alleviates constraints on backpropagation through the solver. Written in JAX, jf1uids is a GPU-compatible and fully differentiable simulator. We demonstrate the advantages of this differentiable physics simulator by retrieving the wind's parameters for an adiabatic stellar wind expansion from the final fluid state using gradient descent. As part of a larger "stellar winds, cosmic rays and machine learning" research track, jf1uids serves as a solid foundation to be extended with additional physics modules, foremost cosmic rays and a neural-net powered gas-cooling surrogate and improved by higher order and more accurate numerical schemes. All code is available under https://github.com/leo1200/jf1uids/.

# Classically studied coherent structures only paint a partial picture of wall-bounded turbulence

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2410.23189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the last 140 years, the mechanisms of transport and dissipation of energy in a turbulent flow have not been completely understood due to the complexity of this phenomenon. The dissipation of energy due to turbulence is significative, and understanding turbulence physics is crucial for fighting the present climate emergency. Previous research has focused on analyzing the so-called coherent structures of the flow (Q events, streaks, and vortices), which are regions of high turbulence transport, high/low streamwise fluctuation, and rotation, respectively. However, the connection between these classically studied structures and the flow development is still uncertain. To fill this gap, here we show a data-driven methodology for objectively identifying high-importance regions in a turbulent flow. A deep-learning model is trained to predict a future state of a turbulent channel flow and the gradient-SHAP explainability algorithm is used to calculate the importance of each grid point for such a prediction. Finally, high-importance regions are computed using the SHAP data, analyzing and comparing their characteristics with those of the other coherent structures. The SHAP analysis provides an objective way to identify the regions of highest importance in the turbulent flow, which exhibit different levels of agreement with the classically studied structures.

# Full-waveform earthquake source inversion using simulation-based inference

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23238

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2410.23238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for full-waveform seismic source inversion using simulation-based inference (SBI). Traditional probabilistic approaches often rely on simplifying assumptions about data errors, which we show can lead to inaccurate uncertainty quantification. SBI addresses this limitation by building an empirical probabilistic model of the data errors using machine learning models, known as neural density estimators, which can then be integrated into the Bayesian inference framework. We apply the SBI framework to point-source moment tensor inversions as well as joint moment tensor and time-location inversions. We construct a range of synthetic examples to explore the quality of the SBI solutions, as well as to compare the SBI results with standard Gaussian likelihood-based Bayesian inversions. We then demonstrate that under real seismic noise, common Gaussian likelihood assumptions for treating full-waveform data yield overconfident posterior distributions that underestimate the moment tensor component uncertainties by up to a factor of 3. We contrast this with SBI, which produces well-calibrated posteriors that generally agree with the true seismic source parameters, and offers an order-of-magnitude reduction in the number of simulations required to perform inference compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques. Finally, we apply our methodology to a pair of moderate magnitude earthquakes in the North Atlantic. We utilise seismic waveforms recorded by the recent UPFLOW ocean bottom seismometer array as well as by regional land stations in the Azores, comparing full moment tensor and source-time location posteriors between SBI and a Gaussian likelihood approach. We find that our adaptation of SBI can be directly applied to real earthquake sources to efficiently produce high quality posterior distributions that significantly improve upon Gaussian likelihood approaches.

## 摘要翻译
arXiv:2410.22371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe the evolution of stochastic processes. The uncertainty of such processes is best represented by the probability density function (PDF), whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (FP-PDE). However, it is generally infeasible to solve the FP-PDE in closed form. In this work, we show that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be trained to approximate the solution PDF using existing methods. The main contribution is the analysis of the approximation error: we develop a theory to construct an arbitrary tight error bound with PINNs. In addition, we derive a practical error bound that can be efficiently constructed with existing training methods. Finally, we explain that this error-bound theory generalizes to approximate solutions of other linear PDEs. Several numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate and validate the proposed methods.

Abstract: In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.

arXiv:2410.22822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for reconstructing the thermal conductivity coefficient in 1D and 2D heat equations using moving sensors that dynamically traverse the domain to record sparse and noisy temperature measurements. We significantly reduce the computational cost associated with forward PDE evaluations by employing automatic differentiation, enabling a more efficient and scalable reconstruction process. This allows the inverse problem to be solved with fewer sensors and observations. Specifically, we demonstrate the successful reconstruction of thermal conductivity on the 1D circle and 2D torus, using one and four moving sensors, respectively, with their positions recorded over time. Our method incorporates sampling algorithms to compute confidence intervals for the reconstructed conductivity, improving robustness against measurement noise. Extensive numerical simulations of heat dynamics validate the efficacy of our approach, confirming both the accuracy and stability of the reconstructed thermal conductivity. Additionally, the method is thoroughly tested using large datasets from machine learning, allowing us to evaluate its performance across various scenarios and ensure its reliability. This approach provides a cost-effective and flexible solution for conductivity reconstruction from sparse measurements, making it a robust tool for solving inverse problems in complex domains.

arXiv:2410.22870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.

arXiv:2410.23236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high energy physics, the ability to reconstruct particles based on their detector signatures is essential for downstream data analyses. A particle reconstruction algorithm based on learning hypergraphs (HGPflow) has previously been explored in the context of single jets. In this paper, we expand the scope to full proton-proton and electron-positron collision events and study reconstruction quality using metrics at the particle, jet, and event levels. Rather than operating on the entire event in a single pass, we train HGPflow on smaller partitions to avoid potentially learning long-range correlations related to the physics process. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible and that on most metrics, HGPflow outperforms both traditional particle flow algorithms and a machine learning-based benchmark model.

Abstract: Extracting scientific understanding from particle-physics experiments requires solving diverse learning problems with high precision and good data efficiency. We propose the Lorentz Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr), a new multi-purpose architecture for high-energy physics. L-GATr represents high-energy data in a geometric algebra over four-dimensional space-time and is equivariant under Lorentz transformations, the symmetry group of relativistic kinematics. At the same time, the architecture is a Transformer, which makes it versatile and scalable to large systems. L-GATr is first demonstrated on regression and classification tasks from particle physics. We then construct the first Lorentz-equivariant generative model: a continuous normalizing flow based on an L-GATr network, trained with Riemannian flow matching. Across our experiments, L-GATr is on par with or outperforms strong domain-specific baselines.

Often, these models originate from physics-based principles and can be derived from corresponding governing equations, often of differential equation form. However, complex system characteristics, such as nonlinearities and energy dissipation mechanisms, often imply that such models are approximative and often imprecise. This challenge is further compounded in SHM, where sensor data is often sparse, making it difficult to fully observe the system's states. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a class of physics-enhanced machine learning (PEML) techniques, for the identification and estimation of dynamical systems. PINNs offer a unique advantage by embedding known physical laws directly into the neural network's loss function, allowing for simple embedding of complex phenomena, even in the presence of uncertainties. This study specifically investigates three key applications of PINNs: state estimation in systems with sparse sensing, joint state-parameter estimation, when both system response and parameters are unknown, and parameter estimation within a Bayesian framework to quantify uncertainties. The results demonstrate that PINNs deliver an efficient tool across all aforementioned tasks, even in presence of modelling errors. However, these errors tend to have a more significant impact on parameter estimation, as the optimization process must reconcile discrepancies between the prescribed model and the true system behavior. Despite these challenges, PINNs show promise in dynamical system modeling, offering a robust approach to handling uncertainties.

Abstract: Climate models serve as critical tools for evaluating the effects of climate change and projecting future climate scenarios. However, the reliance on numerical simulations of physical equations renders them computationally intensive and inefficient. While deep learning methodologies have made significant progress in weather forecasting, they are still unstable for climate emulation tasks. Here, we propose PACER, a lightweight 684K parameter Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate Emulator. PACER emulates temperature and precipitation stably for 86 years while only being trained on greenhouse gas emissions data. We incorporate a fundamental physical law of advection-diffusion in PACER accounting for boundary conditions and empirically estimating the diffusion co-efficient and flow velocities from emissions data. PACER has been trained on 15 climate models provided by ClimateSet outperforming baselines across most of the climate models and advancing a new state of the art in a climate diagnostic task.

Abstract: With the advent and development of real-world quantum technology applications, a practically-focused quantum education including student quantum experiments are gaining increasing importance in physics curricula. In this paper, using the DeFT framework, we present an analysis of the representations in our AR-enhanced quantum cryptography student experiment, in order to assess their potential for promoting conceptual learning. We also discuss learner visual attention with respect to the provided multiple representations based on the eye gaze data we have obtained from a pilot study where N=38 students carried out the tasks in our AR-enhanced quantum cryptography student experiment.

# Parameter uncertainties for imperfect surrogate models in the low-noise regime

Abstract: Bayesian regression determines model parameters by minimizing the expected loss, an upper bound to the true generalization error. However, the loss ignores misspecification, where models are imperfect. Parameter uncertainties from Bayesian regression are thus significantly underestimated and vanish in the large data limit. This is particularly problematic when building models of low-noise, or near-deterministic, calculations, as the main source of uncertainty is neglected. We analyze the generalization error of misspecified, near-deterministic surrogate models, a regime of broad relevance in science and engineering. We show posterior distributions must cover every training point to avoid a divergent generalization error and design an ansatz that respects this constraint, which for linear models incurs minimal overhead. This is demonstrated on model problems before application to thousand dimensional datasets in atomistic machine learning. Our efficient misspecification-aware scheme gives accurate prediction and bounding of test errors where existing schemes fail, allowing this important source of uncertainty to be incorporated in computational workflows.

# Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature for Physics-Informed Neural Networks

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.

Abstract: All-atom molecular simulations offer detailed insights into macromolecular phenomena, but their substantial computational cost hinders the exploration of complex biological processes. We introduce Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field (AMARO), a new neural network potential (NNP) that combines an O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture, TensorNet, with a coarse-graining map that excludes hydrogen atoms. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.

# Predicting Molecular Ground-State Conformation via Conformation Optimization

arXiv:2410.09795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting ground-state conformation from the corresponding molecular graph is crucial for many chemical applications, such as molecular modeling, molecular docking, and molecular property prediction. Recently, many learning-based methods have been proposed to replace time-consuming simulations for this task. However, these methods are often inefficient and sub-optimal as they merely rely on molecular graph information to make predictions from scratch. In this work, considering that molecular low-quality conformations are readily available, we propose a novel framework called ConfOpt to predict molecular ground-state conformation from the perspective of conformation optimization. Specifically, ConfOpt takes the molecular graph and corresponding low-quality 3D conformation as inputs, and then derives the ground-state conformation by iteratively optimizing the low-quality conformation under the guidance of the molecular graph. During training, ConfOpt concurrently optimizes the predicted atomic 3D coordinates and the corresponding interatomic distances, resulting in a strong predictive model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConfOpt significantly outperforms existing methods, thus providing a new paradigm for efficiently and accurately predicting molecular ground-state conformation.

# A Bdh2-driven Lysosome to Mitochondria Iron Trafficking Controls Ferroptosis in Melanoma

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5345588/latest

## 摘要翻译
Iron sustains cancer cell phenotypic and metabolic plasticity, yet it also sensitizes the mesenchymal/drug-tolerant persister phenotype to ferroptosis. This posits that iron compartmentalization must be tightly regulated. However, the molecular machinery governing organelle Fe2+ compartmentalization remains elusive. Here, we identified Bdh2, the mammalian homolog of the bacterial EntA, as a key effector of inter-organelle Fe2+ redistribution and ferroptosis vulnerability during melanoma transition from a melanocytic (MEL) to a mesenchymal-like (MES) phenotype. In metabolically proficient MEL cells, Bdh2 localizes at the mitochondria-lysosome contacts to generate the siderophore 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA) that ferries iron into the mitochondria. Fe2+ transfer by Bdh2 endorses OXPHOS and ATP production, utilized by V-ATPase for lysosomal acidification and MLC maintenance. Loss of Bdh2 expression alters lysosomal pH and MLC tethering dynamics causing lysosomal iron sequestration, which primes MES cells for ferroptosis. Rescuing Bdh2 expression, or supplementing 2,5-DHBA, rectifies lysosomal pH and MLCs, protecting MES cells from ferroptosis and enhancing their ability to metastasize through the bloodstream. Thus, we unveiled a Bdh2-dependent evolutionary-conserved mechanism that orchestrates inter-organelle Fe2+ transfer, linking metabolic regulation of lysosomal pH to the ferroptosis vulnerability of the MES/drug-tolerant persister cells.
