# Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain

## 各向异性海森堡自旋链中的边缘模式和边界杂质

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194

arXiv:2412.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.

Abstract: Through a combination of crystal symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations we unveil a possible microscopic origin of the unexpected insulating behavior reported in the honeycomb Kitaev material Cu$_2$IrO$_3$. Our study suggests that this material hosts an instability towards charge ordering of the Ir ions, with alternating magnetic Ir$^{4+}$ and non-magnetic Ir$^{3+}$ ions arranged on the honeycomb lattice. In this case, the next-nearest-neighbor interactions that couple magnetic Ir$^{4+}$ ions form an enlarged triangular lattice, instead of the expected honeycomb lattice. The magnetic Cu$^{2+}$ ions located at the centre of the iridium honeycomb voids also form a triangular lattice, and additionally contribute to the magnetization of the system. Together, the interpenetrated Ir$^{4+}$ and Cu$^{2+}$ triangular lattices present a novel type of honeycomb Kitaev lattice composed of two types of magnetic ions.

# Theory of polarization-switchable electrical conductivity anisotropy in nonpolar semiconductors

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00287

arXiv:2412.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic propagation of particles is a fundamental transport phenomenon in solid state physics. As for crystalline semiconductors, the anisotropic charge transport opens novel designing routes for electronic devices, where the electrical manipulation of anisotropic resistance provides essential guarantees. Motivated by the concept of anisotropic magnetoresistance, we develop an original theory on the electrically manipulatable anisotropic electroresistance. We show that when gaining electric polarization, nonpolar semiconductors can showcase anisotropic electrical conductivities between two perpendicular directions and the electrical conductivity anisotropy (ECA) is switchable by flipping the polarization. By symmetry analysis, we identify several point groups hosting the polarization-switchable ECA. These point groups simultaneously enable polarization-reversal induced conductivity change along specific directions, akin to the tunnelling electroresistance in ferroelectric tunnel junctions. First-principles-based conductivity calculations predict that AlP and NaSrP are two good materials having such exotic charge transport. Our theory can motivate the design of intriguing anisotropic electronic devices (e.g., anisotropic memristor and field effect transistor).

# Topological magnetism in diluted artificial adatom lattices

## 稀释的人工吸附原子晶格中的拓扑磁性

arXiv:2412.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control matter at the atomic scale has revolutionized our understanding of the physical world, opening doors to unprecedented technological advancements. Quantum technology, which harnesses the unique principles of quantum mechanics, enables us to construct and manipulate atomic structures with extraordinary precision.
  Here, we propose a bottom-up approach to create topological magnetic textures in diluted adatom lattices on the Nb(110) surface. By fine-tuning adatom spacing, previously inaccessible magnetic phases can emerge. Our findings reveal that interactions between magnetic adatoms, mediated by the Nb substrate, foster the formation of unique topological spin textures, such as skyrmions and anti-skyrmions, both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic. Since Nb can be superconducting, our findings present a novel platform with valuable insights into the interplay between topological magnetism and superconductivity, paving the way for broader exploration of topological superconductivity in conjunction with spintronics applications.

# Bimerons as Edge states in Thin Magnetic Strips

## Bimerons作为薄磁条中的边缘状态

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00483

arXiv:2412.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic bimerons are potential information carriers in spintronic devices. Bimerons, topologically equivalent to skyrmions, manifest in chiral magnetic systems with in-plane magnetization due to anisotropies or external magnetic fields. Applications demanding their current-driven motion face significant challenges, notably the bimeron Hall effect, which causes transverse movement and annihilation at nanomagnet borders. This study addresses the problem of stabilizing bimeron propagation under current-driven conditions. We demonstrate that bimerons can propagate through thin ferromagnetic strips without annihilation when the easy-axis anisotropy and the electric current are orthogonal. Our findings indicate that below a threshold value of current, the repulsion between the bimeron and the strip boundary allows for stable soliton propagation, even in bent regions. This phenomenon extends to bimeron chains, which propagate parallel to the current flow. By enabling stable long-distance propagation, our results open new avenues for developing bimeron-based racetrack memory devices, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of future spintronic applications.

# Optical activity of chiral excitons

## 手性激子的光学活性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00602

arXiv:2412.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent activity in the area of chiroptical phenomena has been focused on the connection between structural asymmetry, electron spin configuration and light matter interactions in chiral semiconductors. In these systems, spin-splitting phenomena emerge due to inversion symmetry breaking and the presence of extended electronic states, yet the connection to chiroptical phenomena is lacking. Here, we develop an analytical effective mass model of chiral excitons, parameterized by density functional theory. The model accounts for parity mixing of the band edge Bloch functions resulting from polar distortions, resulting in magnetic dipole allowed transitions. Through the study of a prototypical chiral 2D hybrid perovskite semiconductor, we show that circular dichroism of the chiral exciton and its interband continuum emerges from spin-splitting via cross coupling of Rashba-like and chiral/helical spin-texture components. As a counterpoint, we apply our model to describe chiroptical properties of excitons in perovskite nanocrystals that occur without chiral lattice distortions.

# Floquet Chern Vector Topological Insulators in Three Dimensions

## Floquet Chern向量三维拓扑绝缘子

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00619

arXiv:2412.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and numerically investigate Chern vector insulators and topological surface states in a three-dimensional lattice, based on phase-delayed temporal-periodic interactions within the tight-binding model. These Floquet interactions break time-reversal symmetry, effectively inducing a gauge field analogous to magnetic flux. This gauge field results in Chern numbers in all spatial dimensions, collectively forming the Chern vector. This vector characterizes the topological phases and signifies the emergence of robust surface states. Numerically, we observe these states propagating unidirectionally without backscattering on all open surfaces of the three-dimensional system. Our work paves the way for breaking time-reversal symmetry and realizing three-dimensional Chern vector topological insulators using temporal-periodic Floquet techniques.

# Quench Spectroscopy for Dissipative and Non-Hermitian Quantum Lattice Models

arXiv:2412.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the open Bose-Hubbard chain confined in the superfluid phase submitted to a sudden global quench on the dissipations and the repulsive interactions. The latter is investigated by calculating the equations of motion of relevant quadratic correlators permitting to study the equal-time connected one-body and density-density correlations functions. We then compute the quench spectral function associated to each observable to perform the quench spectroscopy of this dissipative quantum lattice model. This permits to unveil the quasiparticle dispersion relation of the Bose-Hubbard chain in the superfluid phase in the presence of loss processes. The applicability of the quench spectroscopy is also generalized to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain in the paramagnetic phase.

arXiv:2412.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize the quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth spin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground for exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$ ions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large spin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles calculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing and controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential applications in quantum technologies.

# Field-induced quantum interference of inelastic scattering in ultracold atomic collisions

## 超冷原子碰撞中非弹性散射的场致量子干涉

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00743

arXiv:2412.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: xploiting quantum interference remains a significant challenge in ultracold inelastic scattering. In this work, we propose a method to enable detectable quantum interference within the two-body loss rate resulting from various inelastic scattering channels. Our approach utilizes a ``ring-coupling" configuration, achieved by combining external radio-frequency and static electric fields during ultracold atomic collisions. We conduct close-coupling calculations for $^7$Li-$^{41}$K collisions at ultracold limit to validate our proposal. The results show that the interference profile displayed in two-body loss rate is unable to be observed with unoptimized external field parameters. Particularly, our findings demonstrate that the two-body loss rate coefficient exhibits distinct constructive and destructive interference patterns near the magnetically induced $p$-wave resonance in the incoming channel near which a rf-induced scattering resonance exists. These interference patterns become increasingly pronounced with greater intensities of the external fields. This work opens a new avenue for controlling inelastic scattering processes in ultracold collisions.

# Magnetically tuned topological phase in graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions

## 石墨烯纳米带异质结中的磁调谐拓扑相

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00859

arXiv:2412.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and magnetism often triggers the exotic quantum phases. Here, we report an accessible scheme to engineer the robust $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topology by intrinsic magnetism, originating from the zigzag segment connecting two armchair segments with different width, in one-dimensional graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions. Our first-principle and model simulations reveal that the emergent spin polarization substantially modifies the dimerization between junction states, forming the special SSH mechanism depending on the magnetic configurations. Interestingly, the topological phase in magnetic state is only determined by the width of the narrow armchair segment, in sharp contrast with that in the normal state. In addition, the emergent magnetism increases the bulk energy band gap by an order of magnitude than that in the nonmagnetic state. We also discuss the $\mathbb{Z}$ topology of the junction states and the termination-dependent of topological end states. Our results bring new way to tune the topology in graphene nanoribbon heterostructure, providing a new platform for future one-dimensional topological devices and molecular-scale spintronics.

Abstract: The intensive study of non-collinear magnets promotes an urgent demand for the quantitative characterization of the non-collinear magnetic structures, which host numerous exotic phenomena. Here we systematically study the non-collinear magnetic structure of an artificial ferrimagnetic multilayer. The AMR measurements reveal two distinct twisted states whose magnetic structures can be quantitatively characterized with the assistance of micromagnetic simulations. Our results manifest AMR as an ideal probe of the non-collinear magnetic structure in artificial ferrimagnets.

# Preparation of hexagonal iron flakes with a hexagonal structure on the sublayer of copper oxides

arXiv:2412.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presented a novel method to prepare hexagonal iron flakes with hexagonal close-packed structures (hcp) on the copper oxide sublayers. Also, it demonstrated that the size and structure of iron grains are functions of sublayer features. The sublayer was prepared by sputtering copper on the glass substrate and annealing it. As the annealing temperature of the copper sublayer increased, the oxygen percentage increased and copper oxide rods were formed. Hexagonal iron flakes were formed after sputtering iron on this sublayer. The XRD analysis showed that these hexagonal flakes have a close-packed hexagonal structure. This finding was further confirmed by the magnetic properties of the samples and by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

# Light-induced hysteresis of electronic polarization in antiferromagnet FePS3

## 反铁磁体FePS3中电子极化的光诱导磁滞

arXiv:2412.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on manipulating materials using light has garnered significant interest, yet examples of controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate the hysteresis of electronic polarization in the antiferromagnetic semiconductor FePS3 via light. Below the N\'eel temperature, we observe linear dichroism (i.e., optical anisotropy) without structural symmetry breaking. Light-induced net polarization aligns along the a-axis (zigzag direction) at 1.6 eV due to the dipolar polarization and along the b-axis (armchair direction) at 2.0 eV due to the combined effects of dipolar and octupolar polarizations, resulting from charge transfer from the armchair to the zigzag direction by light. Unexpected hysteresis of the electronic polarization occurs at 2.0 eV due to the octupolar polarization, in contrast to the absence of such hysteresis at 1.6 eV. We attribute this to a symmetry breaking of the light-induced phase of FePS3 involving electronic polarization within the spin lattice. This study suggests a new mechanism for generating and controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials using light, with implications for future device applications.

arXiv:2412.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of magnonic Fabry-P\'erot resonators as programmable phase shifters for spin-wave computing. The resonator, composed of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film coupled with a CoFeB nanostripe, operates through dynamic dipolar coupling, leading to wavelength downconversion and the formation of a magnonic cavity. Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect (SNS-MOKE) microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that these resonators can induce a $\pi$ phase shift in the transmitted spin wave. The phase shift is highly sensitive to the magnetization alignment within the resonator, allowing for on-demand control via magnetic switching. This feature, combined with low-loss transmission, positions the magnonic Fabry-P\'erot resonator as a promising component for reconfigurable magnonic circuits and spin-wave computing devices.

Abstract: Fictitious magnetic fields can be introduced in quantum magnets by the strain engineering and the Aharonov-Casher effect. Here, we study impacts of a uniform fictitious magnetic field and corresponding Landau quantization on the Neel order in the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice as a prototypical system of quantum magnets. We first analyze the system by using the spin-wave approximation. It is found that the staggered magnetization is enhanced by the fictitious magnetic field and it shows a simple scaling behavior with respect to the magnetic length, in contrast to a naive expectation based on the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also perform density matrix renormalization group calculations to fully take quantum effects into account and obtain quantitatively more accurate results. The enhancement is found to be anomalously strong and it shows a non-trivial scaling behavior or a fluctuation induced discontinuity. These results are beyond the well known understanding of correlated systems under magnetic fields called the magnetic catalysis.

arXiv:2412.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is observed only when a magnetic field is applied along the magnetic hard axis ($\mathbf{H}\parallel c$). This phenomenon suggests an unconventional CMR mechanism potentially driven by the interplay between magnetism, topological band structure, and/or chiral orbital currents (COC). By comparing electrical resistance measurements using continuous direct currents and pulse currents, we found that the current-induced insulator-metal transition, supporting the COC-driven CMR mechanism, is likely a consequence of Joule heating effects. Additionally, multiple magnetic field-induced metamagnetic transitions were identified through AC magnetostriction coefficient experiments, but only when $\mathbf{H}\parallel c$. Importantly, the transition at $\sim$ 5 T marks the boundary between the low-field CMR and high-field weak MR. These findings suggest that field-induced metamagnetic transition combined with partial polarization of magnetic moments are the primary causes of the band gap closure, leading to the observed CMR in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$.

Abstract: The high electrical conductivity and good chemical stability of MXenes offer hopes for their use in many applications, such as wearable electronics, energy storage, or electromagnetic interference shielding. While their optical, electronic and electrochemical properties have been widely studied, the information on thermal properties of MXenes is scarce. In this study, we investigate the heat transport properties of Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene single flakes using scanning thermal microscopy and find exceptionally low anisotropic thermal conductivities within the Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ flakes, leading to an effective thermal conductivity of 0.78$\pm$0.21 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. This observation is in stark contrast to the predictions of the Wiedemann-Franz law, as the estimated Lorenz number is only 0.25 of the classical value. Due to the combination of low thermal conductivity and low emissivity of Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$, the heat loss from it is two orders of magnitude smaller than that from common metals. Our study explores the heat transport mechanisms of MXenes and highlights a promising approach for developing thermal insulation, two-dimensional thermoelectric, or infrared stealth materials.

# Moire magnetism in CrBr3 multilayers emerging from differential strain

## 差异应变产生的CrBr3多层膜中的莫尔磁性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01658

arXiv:2412.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces between twisted 2D materials host a wealth of physical phenomena originating from the long-scale periodicity associated with the resulting moire structure. Besides twisting, an alternative route to create structures with comparably long or even longer periodicities is inducing a differential strain between adjacent layers in a van der Waals (vdW) material. Despite recent theoretical efforts analyzing its benefits, this route has not yet been implemented experimentally. Here we report evidence for the simultaneous presence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions in CrBr3 _a hallmark of moire magnetism_ from the observation of an unexpected magnetoconductance in CrBr3 tunnel barriers with ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 and graphene electrodes. The observed magnetoconductance evolves with temperature and magnetic field as the magnetoconductance measured in small angle CrBr3 twisted junctions, in which moire magnetism occurs. Consistent with Raman measurements and theoretical modeling, we attribute the phenomenon to the presence of a differential strain in the CrBr3 multilayer, which locally modifies the stacking and the interlayer exchange between adjacent CrBr3 layers, resulting in spatially modulated spin textures. Our conclusions indicate that inducing differential strain in vdW multilayers is a viable strategy to create moire-like superlattices, which in the future may offer in-situ continuous tunability even at low temperatures.

# Defect-induced spin textures in magnetic solids

## 磁性固体中缺陷诱导的自旋织构

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01662

arXiv:2412.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin textures induced by nonmagnetic vacancies in classical noncollinear magnets. By developing an "elasticity theory" for spin systems, we show that a defect-induced spin readjustment decays with a power law at large distances. The power-law exponent depends on the multipole moment of the local spin deformation, which is in turn determined by both the lattice symmetry and the equilibrium spin configuration in the absence of a defect. The interplay of these two ingredients is best illustrated by the J1-J2 Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice for which a point vacancy may produce spin deformations that decay as 1/r^2 for the q=0 ground state and as a 1/r for the \sqrt{3} x \sqrt{3} magnetic structure. The analytic conclusions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations. We also compute the fractional magnetic moments associated with vacancies and other lattice defects. Our results shed light on relative fragility of different magnetic structures with respect to spin glass formation at higher doping levels.

# Optimisation and Loss Analyses of Pulsed Field Magnetisation in a Superconducting Motor with Cryocooled Iron Cores

arXiv:2412.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2D electromagnetic-thermal coupled numerical model has been developed using the finite element method and validated against experimental data to investigate a superconducting machine featuring high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape stacks and cryocooled iron cores. The HTS stacks are transformed into trapped field stacks (TFSs) through pulsed field magnetisation (PFM), generating rotor fields. After PFM, the superconducting motor operates on the same principle as permanent magnet synchronous motors. This study explores the behaviour of HTS stacks by altering the stack's layer number from one to nine and adjusting the pulsed current amplitude from 250 A to 1000 A. The primary objective of this paper is to identify the optimal combination of pulsed current amplitudes and TFS layer numbers for achieving maximum magnetisation fields. The secondary objective is to evaluate the overall losses in both superconducting and non-superconducting parts of the machine during magnetisation, including heat generated in various layers of the TFS, and losses in the motor's active materials (copper windings and iron cores). Two motor configurations were proposed, and two calculation methods using linear interpolation of iron losses and steel grades were introduced to estimate the iron losses for the studied iron material, M270-35A. This pioneering study is expected to serve as a valuable reference for loss analyses and structural design considerations in developing superconducting machines.

Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage in energy storage and power extraction is a primary objective in the design of quantum-based batteries. We explore how long-range (LR) interactions in conjunction with Floquet driving can improve the performance of quantum batteries, particularly when the battery is initialized in a fully polarized state. In particular, we exhibit that by optimizing the driving frequency, the maximum average power scales super extensively with system-size which is not achievable through next-nearest neighbor interactions or traditional unitary charging, thereby gaining genuine quantum advantage. We illustrate that the inclusion of either two-body or many-body interaction terms in the LR charging Hamiltonian leads to a scaling benefit. Furthermore, we discover that a super-linear scaling in power results from increasing the strength of interaction compared to the transverse magnetic field and the range of interaction with low fall-off rate, highlighting the advantageous role of long-range interactions in optimizing quantum battery charging.

Abstract: Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t>0$ and $t'/t<0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t>0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t<0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.

Abstract: Symmetry algebras of quantum many-body systems with locality can be understood using commutant algebras, which are defined as algebras of operators that commute with a given set of local operators. In this work, we show that these symmetry algebras can be expressed as frustration-free ground states of a local superoperator, which we refer to as a ``super-Hamiltonian". We demonstrate this for conventional symmetries such as $Z_2$, $U(1)$, and $SU(2)$, where the symmetry algebras map to various kinds of ferromagnetic ground states, as well as for unconventional ones that lead to weak ergodicity breaking phenomena of Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars. In addition, we show that the low-energy excitations of this super-Hamiltonian can be understood as approximate symmetries, which in turn are related to slowly relaxing hydrodynamic modes in symmetric systems. This connection is made precise by relating the super-Hamiltonian to the superoperator that governs the operator relaxation in noisy symmetric Brownian circuits, and this physical interpretation also provides a novel interpretation for Mazur bounds for autocorrelation functions. We find examples of gapped/gapless super-Hamiltonians indicating the absence/presence of slow-modes, which happens in the presence of discrete/continuous symmetries. In the gapless cases, we recover hydrodynamic modes such as diffusion, tracer diffusion, and asymptotic scars in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry, Hilbert space fragmentation, and a tower of quantum scars respectively. In all, this demonstrates the power of the commutant algebra framework in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of exact symmetries, and associated approximate symmetries and hydrodynamic modes, and their dynamical consequences in systems with locality.

# Electroluminescence and Energy Transfer Mediated by Hyperbolic Polaritons

Abstract: Under high electrical current, some materials can emit electromagnetic radiation beyond incandescence. This phenomenon, referred to as electroluminescence, leads to the efficient emission of visible photons and is the basis of domestic lighting devices (e.g., light-emitting diodes). In principle, electroluminescence can lead to mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission of confined light-matter excitations called phonon-polaritons, resulting from the coupling of photons with crystal lattice vibrations (optical phonons). In particular, phonon-polaritons arising in the van der Waals crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) exhibit hyperbolic dispersion, which enhances light-matter coupling. For this reason, electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) has been proposed as an explanation for the peculiar radiative energy transfer within hBN-encapsulated graphene transistors. However, since HPhPs are confined, they are inaccessible in the far-field, so that any hint of electroluminescence is only based on indirect electronic signatures and needs to be confirmed by direct observation. Here, we demonstrate far-field mid-IR ({\lambda} = 6.5 {\mu}m) electroluminescence of HPhPs excited by strongly biased high-mobility graphene within a van der Waals heterostructure, and we quantify the associated radiative energy transfer through the material. The presence of HPhPs is revealed via far-field mid-IR spectroscopy due to their elastic scattering at discontinuities in the heterostructure. The associated radiative flux is quantified by mid-IR pyrometry of the substrate receiving the energy. This radiative energy transfer is shown to be reduced in hBN with nanoscale inhomogeneities, demonstrating the central role of the electromagnetic environment in this process.

# Fermi Liquid near a q=0 Charge Quantum Critical Point

Abstract: We analyze the quasiparticle interaction function (the fully dressed and antisymmetrized interaction between fermions) for a two-dimensional Fermi liquid at zero temperature close to a q=0 charge quantum critical point (QCP) in the $s-$wave channel (the one leading to phase separation). By the Ward identities, this vertex function must be related to quasiparticle residue $Z$, which can be obtained independently from the fermionic self-energy. We show that to satisfy these Ward identities, one needs to go beyond the standard diagrammatic formulation of Fermi-liquid theory and include series of additional contributions to the vertex function. These contributions are not present in a conventional Fermi liquid, but do emerge near a QCP, where the effective 4-fermion interaction is mediated by a soft dynamical boson. We demonstrate explicitly that including these terms restores the Ward identity. Our analysis is built on previous studies of the vertex function near an antiferromagnetic QCP [Phys. Rev. B 89, 045108 (2014)] and a d-wave charge-nematic QCP [Phys. Rev. B 81, 045110 (2010)]. We show that for $s-$wave charge QCP the analysis is more straightforward and allows one to obtain the full quasiparticle interaction function (the Landau function) near a QCP. We show that all partial components of this function (Landau parameters) diverge near a QCP, in the same way as the effective mass $m^*$, except for the $s$-wave charge component, which approaches $-1$. Consequently, the susceptibilities in all channels, except for the critical one, remain finite at a QCP, as they should.

Abstract: Magnon dynamics in skyrmion lattices have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in topological magnonics. Existing theories often follow a single-momentum approach, assuming significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) to minimize the skyrmion's dimensions, which can lead to oversimplification in describing magnon behavior. This study introduces a multi-momentum operator theory for magnons in large 2D skyrmions, where each skyrmion encompasses several thousand spins. The proposed theory fully transforms the magnon Hamiltonian into momentum space, incorporating off-diagonal terms to capture umklapp scattering caused by the skyrmion wave vectors. Our results reveal deviations from single-momentum theories, demonstrating that flat bands are not universal features of the skyrmionic magnon spectrum. Additionally, we find that manipulating the skyrmion size with an external magnetic field induces multiple topological phase transitions. At high magnetic fields, the low-energy magnon spectrum becomes densely packed and entirely topological, resembling a topological band continuum.

Abstract: Planar germanium quantum wells have recently been shown to host hard-gapped superconductivity. Additionally, quantum dot spin qubits in germanium are well-suited for quantum information processing, with isotopic purification to a nuclear spin-free material expected to yield long coherence times. Therefore, as one of the few group IV materials with the potential to host superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, proximitized quantum dots in germanium is a compelling platform to achieve and combine topological superconductivity with existing and novel qubit modalities. Here we demonstrate a quantum dot (QD) in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure proximitized by a platinum germanosilicide (PtGeSi) superconducting lead (SC), forming a SC-QD-SC junction. We show tunability of the QD-SC coupling strength, as well as gate control of the ratio of charging energy and the induced gap. We further exploit this tunability by exhibiting control of the ground state of the system between even and odd parity. Furthermore, we characterize the critical magnetic field strengths, finding a critical out-of-plane field of 0.90(4). Finally we explore sub-gap spin splitting in the device, observing rich physics in the resulting spectra, that we model using a zero-bandwidth model in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov limit. The demonstration of controllable proximitization at the nanoscale of a germanium quantum dot opens up the physics of novel spin and superconducting qubits, and Josephson junction arrays in a group IV material.

Abstract: Our study delves into the modifications observed in Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation when its generating charged particle moves parallel to an interface formed by two generic magnetoelectric media, focusing on topological insulators. We compute the electromagnetic field through the Green's function. Applying the far-field approximation and the steepest descent method, we derive analytical expressions for the electric field, revealing contributions from spherical and lateral waves with topological origins. Subsequently, we analyze the angular distribution of the radiation, particularly focusing on parallel motions in close proximity to the interface. Our findings indicate that the radiation along the Vavilov-Cherenkov cone is inhomogeneous and asymmetric. We analyze the radiated energy at both sides of the interface. Finally, we discuss the particle's retarding force, which is notably enhanced in the ultrarelativistic regime. We illustrate these results for the topological insulator TlBiSe$_2$ and the magnetoelectric TbPO$_4$.

Abstract: The formation of dark states is an important concept in quantum sciences, but its compatibility with strong interparticle interactions -- for example, in a quantum degenerate gas -- is hardly explored. Here, we realize a dark state in one of the spins of a two-component, resonantly interacting Fermi gas using a $\Lambda$ system within the $D_2$ transitions of $^6$Li at high magnetic field. The dark state is created in a micrometer-sized region within a one-dimensional channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs. The particle transport between the reservoirs is used as a probe. We observe that atoms are transported in the dark state and the superfluid-assisted fast current is preserved. If the dark state resonant condition is not met, the transport is suppressed by the spontaneous emission. We also uncover an asymmetry in the transport timescale across the two-photon resonance, which is absent in the non-interacting regime and diminished at higher temperatures. This work raises questions on the interplay of dark states with interparticle interactions and opens up perspectives for optical manipulation of fermionic pairing.

Abstract: We discuss the discovery by variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods of a series of multinode quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in extended Kitaev models on the honeycomb lattice. Like the gapless Kitaev spin liquid with its two nodes at K and K$^\prime$, these multinode QSLs are characterized by an emergent Z$_2$ gauge structure and a discrete number of symmetry-protected Majorana cones in their low-energy excitation spectrum. Because the cones are gapped by weak magnetic fields, nonzero Chern numbers are obtained and the ground state becomes one of many possible Abelian or non-Abelian chiral spin liquids. Here we focus on the projective symmetry group (PSG)-guided VMC approach to the Kitaev model with various symmetry-allowed extended interactions. Based on the VMC phase diagrams of these models, we propose a framework for the classification of nodal QSLs that includes the PSG, the chiralities of the cones, and the way in which the cones are symmetry-related. At present, the known candidate Kitaev materials seem to lie outside the parameter regimes of the multinode QSL phases. However, with more than 100 Z$_2$ PSGs for spin-orbit-coupled states on the honeycomb lattice, we anticipate that more than one multinode QSL will be realized experimentally in future work.

Abstract: Using the model of four sublattices, the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire-Kittel phenomenological approach and the Stephenson-Highland ionic adsorption model for the description of coupled polar and antipolar long-range orders in ferroics, we calculated analytically the phase diagrams and polar properties of Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles covered by surface ions in dependence on their size, surface ions density, samarium content "x" and temperature. The size effects and ferro-ionic coupling govern the appearance and stability conditions of the long-range ordered ferroelectric, reentrant ferrielectric and antiferroelectric phases in the Bi1-xSmxFeO3 nanoparticles. Calculated phase diagrams are in a qualitative agreement with the X-ray diffraction phase analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, infra-red spectroscopy and electrophysical measurements of the Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanopowders sintered by the solution combustion method. The combined theoretical-experimental approach allows to establish the influence of the ferro-ionic coupling and size effects in Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles on their polar properties.

Abstract: The first-order magnetic phase transition (MPT) usually happens with a very wide magnetic field span about tens of thousands Oersted which hinders its applications. In this work, we induce a domino-like MPT via introducing a bias voltage in FeRh thin film and thus realize a large narrowing of transition magnetic field span from 6*10^4 Oe to lower than 2*10^3 Oe at room temperature. Meanwhile, nonvolatile switchings between pure magnetic phases of FeRh at room temperature also can be realized by applying voltage pulses. The critical condition and phase diagram for domino-like MPTs are obtained in theory and our experiments support it well. Our works not only benefit the studies and applications of MPT-based devices but also are significant in the applications of the phase transition systems with resistance change.

Abstract: A ferroic alignment of a time-reversal-even axial vector, which is called the ferroaxial ordered state, is identified by the spontaneous rotational distortion of the lattice structure to break the vertical mirror symmetry.

By adopting the symmetry-adapted multipole representation, we elucidate the emergent cross-product form of the spin-orbit coupling by the interplay between the atomic spin-orbit coupling and the d-p hybridization according to the vertical mirror symmetry breaking, which corresponds to the electronic order parameter of the ferroaxial ordering.

Abstract: The essence of the Mpemba effect is that non-equilibrium systems may relax faster the further they are from their equilibrium configuration. In the quantum realm, this phenomenon arises in the dynamics of closed systems, where it is witnessed by fundamental features such as symmetry and entanglement. Here, we study the quantum Mpemba effect in charge-preserving random circuits on qudits combining extensive numerical simulations and analytical arguments. We show that the more asymmetric certain classes of initial states (tilted ferromagnets) are, the faster they restore symmetry and reach the grand-canonical ensemble. Conversely, other classes of states (tilted antiferromagnets) do not show the Mpemba effect. We provide a simple and general mechanism underlying the effect, based on the spreading of nonconserved operators in terms of conserved densities. Our analysis is based on minimal principles -- locality, unitarity, and symmetry. Consequently, our results represent a significant advancement in clarifying the emergence of Mpemba physics in chaotic systems.

Abstract: We study an explicit formula for the thermodynamic potential of the AdS dyonic black brane solution with an axio-dilaton hair, which was discovered in an extension of the $(3+1)$d Gubser-Rocha model enjoying S-duality. From the thermodynamic potential, we can compute the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibilities of the dyonic solution. The result of the magnetization is negative implying that the system is diamagnetic. Subsequently, we consider a specific neutral limit of the dyonic solution. In this setup, we find that the system exhibits spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. The order parameter is given by a complex operator which is dual to the axio-dilaton field in the bulk. Interestingly, the system has a finite Hall conductivity even in the absence of the external magnetic field, and it is related to the phase of the complex operator.

# Anomalous radiation reaction in a circularly polarized field

## 圆极化场中的反常辐射反应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07664

arXiv:2408.07664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics in a circularly polarized electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron rotating under the field leads to the quantum recoil force acting on the electron perpendicularly to the velocity of its forward movement, which differs crucially from the known classical recoil force directed oppositely to the velocity. Physically, such an anomalous radiation reaction arises from the one-loop QED correction to the photon emission and has no analogue within the classical electrodynamics. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for electrons in strong laser fields.

# Quantum emitter interacting with a dispersive dielectric object: a model based on the modified Langevin noise formalism

arXiv:2410.10730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the interaction of a quantum emitter with a finite-size dispersive dielectric object in an unbounded space within the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, using the modified Langevin noise formalism, without any restrictions on the emitter level structure or dipole operator. The quantized electromagnetic field consists of two contributions: the medium-assisted field, which accounts for the electromagnetic field generated by the noise polarization currents of the dielectric, and the scattering-assisted field, which takes into account the electromagnetic field incoming from infinity and scattered by the dielectric. We show that the emitter couples to two distinct bosonic baths: a medium-assisted bath and a scattering-assisted bath, each characterized by its own spectral density. We identify the conditions under which the electromagnetic environment composed of these two baths can be effectively replaced by a single bosonic bath, so that the reduced dynamics of the quantum emitter remain unchanged. In particular, when the initial states of the medium- and scattering-assisted baths are thermal states with the same temperature, we find that a single bosonic bath with a spectral density equal to the sum of the medium-assisted and scattering-assisted spectral densities is equivalent to the original electromagnetic environment.

# A framework for discrete optimization of stellarator coils

## 恒星线圈离散优化的框架

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00267

arXiv:2412.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing magnets for three-dimensional plasma confinement is a key task for advancing the stellarator as a fusion reactor concept. Stellarator magnets must produce an accurate field while leaving adequate room for other components and being reasonably simple to construct and assemble. In this paper, a framework for coil design and optimization is introduced that enables the attainment of sparse magnet solutions with arbitrary restrictions on where coils may be located. The solution space is formulated as a "wireframe" consisting of a mesh of interconnected wire segments enclosing the plasma. Two methods are developed for optimizing the current distribution on a wireframe: Regularized Constrained Least Squares (RCLS), which uses a linear least-squares approach to optimize the currents in each segment, and Greedy Stellarator Coil Optimization (GSCO), a fully discrete procedure in which loops of current are added to the mesh one by one to achieve the desired magnetic field on the plasma boundary. Examples will be presented of solutions obtainable with each method, some of which are able to achieve high field accuracy while obeying spatial constraints that permit easy assembly.

arXiv:2412.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects leading to generation of quasi-stationary and propagating electromagnetic fields during the propagation of a laser-driven current discharge pulse in extended targets are considered. The results of numerical modeling describe the interaction of a relativistically intense ultrashort laser pulse with an extended dense target and its transformation into a powerful discharge current pulse. It is shown that under certain conditions such a pulse can be used to generate strong electromagnetic fields with certain spatio-temporal properties. Particular attention is paid to the influence of the discharge pulse parameters on the properties of the induced electromagnetic fields. Analysis of the discharge current profile in dependence on the target thickness is provided and the dynamics of discharge current pulse profile evolution is studied on the time scale $\sim 10$ ps, when the propagation distance is $\sim 3$ mm.

arXiv:2412.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simulation workflow has been developed to study dark current (DC) radiation effects using ACE3P and Geant4. The integrated workflow interfaces particle data transfer and geometry between the electromagnetic (EM) cavity simulation code ACE3P and the radiation code Geant4, targeting large-scale problems using high-performance computing. The process begins by calculating the operating mode in the vacuum region of an accelerator structure and tracking field-emitted electrons influenced by the EM fields of the mode calculated by ACE3P. It then transfers particle data at the vacuum-wall interface for subsequent radiation calculations within the wall enclosure materials through Geant4 calculation. The whole integrated simulation workflow will be demonstrated through large-scale dark current radiation calculations for the KEK 56-cell traveling-wave structure, and the efficiency of performing these simulations on the NERSC supercomputer Perlmutter will be presented.

arXiv:2412.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar polyatomic molecules provide an ideal but largely unexplored platform to encode qubits in rotational states. Here, we trap cold (100-600 mK) formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) inside an electric box and perform a Ramsey-type experiment to observe long-lived (~100 $\mu$s) coherences between symmetry-protected molecular states with opposite rotation but identical orientation, representing a quasi-hidden molecular degree of freedom. As a result, the observed qubit is insensitive to the magnitude of an external electric field, and depends only weakly on magnetic fields. Our findings provide a basis for future quantum and precision experiments with trapped cold molecules.

Abstract: Motivated by the Hamilton$-$Jacobi approach of fields with constraints, we analyse the classical structure of three different constrained field systems: (i) the scalar field coupled to two flavors of fermions through Yukawa couplings (ii) the scalar field coupled minimally to the vector potential (iii) the electromagnetic field coupled to a spinor. The equations of motion are obtained as total differential equations in many variables. The integrability conditions are investigated. The second and third constrained systems are quantized using canonical path integral formulation based on the Hamilton$-$Jacobi treatment.

Abstract: We present tabulated data for numerical calculations of relative para- and diamagentic contributions to the magnetic shielding constant ($\sigma$) of the Dirac one-electron atoms with a pointlike, spinless and motionless nuclei of charge $Ze$. Exploiting the analytical formulas for the diamagnetic ($\sigma_{d}$) and paramagnetic ($\sigma_{p}$) terms of $\sigma$, valid for an arbitrary discrete energy state, recently derived by us with the aid of the Gordon decomposition technique, we have found the numerical values of $\sigma_{d}/\sigma$ and $\sigma_{p}/\sigma$ for the ground state and for the first two sets of excited states (i.e.: $2s_{1/2}$, $2p_{1/2}$, $2p_{3/2}$, $3s_{1/2}$, $3p_{1/2}$, $3p_{3/2}$, $3d_{3/2}$, and $3d_{5/2}$) of the relativistic hydrogenic ions with the nuclear charge number from the range $1 \leqslant Z \leqslant 137$. The comparisons of our results with those reported by other authors for some atomic states are also presented. We also compile here the numerical values of the total magnetic shielding constants for the ground state $1s_{1/2}$ and for each state belonging to the first set of excited states of selected hydrogenlike ions, obtained with the use of three different values of the fine-structure constant, i.e.: $\alpha^{-1}=137.035 \: 999 \: 139$ (from CODATA 2014), $\alpha^{-1}=137.035 \: 999 \: 084$ (from CODATA 2018) and $\alpha^{-1}=137.035 \: 999 \: 177$ (from CODATA 2024).

Abstract: Enhancement of the bremsstrahlung X-ray radiation (BSXR) power generated by the high-current relativistic electron beam (REB) of a pulsed direct-action accelerator TEMP-B is being curried out to use in particular for studying the radiation resistance of walls material of radioactive waste containers. For this the magnetic field in which REB is transported in the drift chamber is taken higher at some distance before the converter to provide REB diameter on the converter the same as in the drift chamber. Scheme of power supply and creation of the required magnetic field for the REB current transportation through the whole distance from the diode to the converter is developed. Higher BSXR dose per REB current pulse at the same energy resource is obtained.

Abstract: Experimental data and results of numerical simulations are presented, concerning excitation of narrowband gigahertz-range wave trains in coaxial guiding structures that are partially filled with ferromagnetic material and may involve periodically arranged metal inserts. The experiments performed confirm the possibility of exciting weakly damped electromagnetic waves by feeding high voltage, unilateral electromagnetic pulses of short duration into the line. The coax line was of outer diameter 50.5 mm, filled with an isotropic dielectric (relative dielectric constant {\epsilon} = 2.25) and a set of ferrite rings with {\epsilon}=16 and saturated-state {\mu} about 4 to 5. With a peak voltage of the primary pulse close to 160 kV and a magnetizing field of 17.5 kA/m, the parameters of the waves excited reached magnitudes as: frequency 1.89 GHz to 2.1 GHz; bandwidth 16%; VHF power at the output about 20 MW.

Abstract: Accurate lifetime measurements of excited states of highly charged ions (HCIs) are essential for advancing diagnostics in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, especially in the X-ray regime. The Hanle effect, which utilizes external magnetic fields to modify photon scattering patterns, provides a powerful technique for these measurements. Previously, this method has been successfully employed for He-like ions. Here, we present a theoretical study of the prospects of the Hanle effect for lifetime determinations of Li-like ions. Our results highlight the potential for plasma diagnostics and X-ray spectral analysis.

arXiv:2412.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the performance of the LABDOS01, a silicon diode-based spectrometer suitable for dose measurements in mixed radiation fields. The instrument is currently being used in two high-altitude environmental dose monitoring projects: SAMADHA (South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly Dosimetry at High Altitude) at Chacaltaya (Bolivia, 5240 m a.s.l.) and CORDIAL (COsmic Rays Dosimetry In Antarctic Latitudes) at the Concordia station (Antarctica, 3233 m a.s.l.). Before installing two of these devices at the measurement sites, the detectors were tested on flight routes covering a wide range of geomagnetic latitudes. The collected dosimetric data were compared with the expectations derived by the CARI-7A software, which provides the absorbed dose rate in silicon due to cosmic ray secondaries at a given position on the Earth. The measured dose rates along the flights at variable altitude and rigidity cutoff agree well with the simulated ones. By analyzing the spectrum of the energy deposited in the silicon layer, we derive an empirical method to approximately evaluate the ambient dose equivalent $H^{*}(10)$, a quantity directly related to the biological damage caused by environmental radiation.

# Hydrogen Utilization as a Plasma Source for Magnetohydrodynamic Direct Power Extraction (MHD-DPE)

arXiv:2412.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the suitability of hydrogen-based plasma in direct power extraction (DPE) as a non-conventional electricity generation method. We apply computational modeling and principles in physics and chemistry to estimate different thermal and electric properties of a water-vapor/nitrogen/cesium-vapor (H2O/N2/Cs) gas mixture with different levels of cesium (Cs) at a fixed temperature of 2300 K (2026.85 {\deg}C). This gas mixture and temperature are selected because they resemble the stoichiometric combustion of hydrogen with air, followed by the addition of the alkali metal element cesium to allow ionization, thus converting the gas mixture into electrically conducting plasma. We vary the cesium mole fraction in the gas mixture by two orders of magnitude, from a minute amount of 0.0625% (1/1600) to a major amount of 16% (0.16). We use these results to further estimate the theoretical upper limit of the electric power output from a unit volume of a high-speed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel, with the plasma accelerated inside it to twice the local speed of sound (Mach number 2) while subject to an applied magnetic field of 5 T (5 teslas). We report that there is an optimum cesium mole fraction of 3%, at which the power output is maximized. Per 1 m3 of plasma volume, the estimated theoretical electric power generation at 1 atm (101.325 kPa) pressure of the hydrogen-combustion mixture is extraordinarily high at 360 MW/m3, and the plasma electric conductivity is 17.5 S/m. This estimated power generation even reaches an impressive level of 1.15 GW/m3 (11500 MW/m3) if the absolute pressure can be decreased to 0.0625 atm (6.333 kPa), at which the electric conductivity exceeds 55 S/m (more than 10 times the electric conductivity of seawater).

Abstract: Electron beam (e-beam) generated plasmas with applied cross electric and magnetic $\left( \textbf{E} \times \textbf{B} \right)$ fields are promising for low-damage material processing. However, these plasmas can be subject to the formation of azimuthally propagating structures that enhance the radial transport of energetic charged species, which can harm the gentle processing capability of the plasma. In this work we investigate the azimuthal structure formation in an e-beam generated $\textbf{E} \times \textbf{B}$ plasma using experimental diagnostics and 2D3V particle-in-cell simulations. Our findings demonstrate the formation of multiple simultaneously occurring azimuthally propagating modes that exhibit a nontrivial radial dependence. It is suggested that the multimodal azimuthal spectrum is caused by the complex nature of the ion dynamics in the plasma.

# Extreme-ultraviolet spatiotemporal vortices via high harmonic generation

## 通过高次谐波产生的极紫外时空涡旋

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01716

arXiv:2412.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV) are space-time structured light pulses with a unique topology that couples spatial and temporal domains and carry transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). Up to now, their generation has been limited to the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum. During the last decade, it was shown that through the process of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) it is possible to up-convert spatial optical vortices that carry longitudinal OAM from the near-infrared into the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), thereby producing vortices with distinct femtosecond and attosecond structure. In this work we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally the generation of EUV spatiotemporal and spatiospectral vortices using near infrared STOV driving laser pulses. We use analytical expressions for focused STOVs to perform macroscopic calculations of HHG that are directly compared to the experimental results. As STOV beams are not eigenmodes of propagation, we characterize the highly-charged EUV STOVs both in the near and far fields, to show that they represent conjugated spatiotemporal and spatiospectral vortex pairs. Our work provides high-frequency light beams topologically coupled at the nanometer/attosecond scales domains with transverse OAM, that could be suitable to explore electronic dynamics in magnetic materials, chiral media, and nanostructures.

Abstract: We present analytical and simulation study of twisted terahertz (THz) radiation generation via propagation of a circularly polarized Laguerre Gaussian (LG) laser pulse in homogeneous plasma embedded in an axial magnetic field. Analytical formulation is based on perturbation technique and quasistatic approximation. Longitudinal and transverse wakefields generated via laser plasma interactions are evaluated using Lorentz force and Maxwells equations in the mildly nonlinear regime. It is observed that two linearly polarized twisted terahertz (THz) radiation beams are generated in mutually perpendicular planes. Superposition of the two beams result in a single linearly polarized twisted THz radiation beam with modified amplitude and polarization direction. Three dimensional (3D) particle in cell (PIC) simulations are performed for this configuration using FBPIC code. Graphical comparison of amplitude of the resultant THz beam obtained via analytical and simulation studies is presented.

Abstract: The two-state solar wind paradigm is based on observations showing that slow and fast solar wind have distinct properties like helium abundances, kinetic signatures, elemental composition, and charge-state ratios. Nominally, the fast wind originates from solar sources that are continuously magnetically open to the heliosphere like coronal holes while the slow wind is from solar sources that are only intermittently open to the heliosphere like helmet streamers and pseudostreamers. The Alfv\'enic slow wind is an emerging 3rd class of solar wind that challenges the two-state fast/slow paradigm. It has slow wind speeds but is highly Alfv\'enic, i.e. has a high correlation between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations along with low compressibility typical of Alfv\'en waves, which is typically observed in fast wind. Its other properties are also more similar to the fast than slow wind. From 28 years of Wind observations at 1 AU, we derive the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\mathrm{He}$), Alfv\'enicity ($\left|\sigma_c\right|$), and solar wind speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$). Characterizing vsw as a function of $\left|\sigma_c\right|$ and $A_\mathrm{He}$, we show that the maximum solar wind speed for plasma accelerated in source regions that are intermittently open is faster than the minimum solar wind speed for plasma accelerated in continuously open regions. We infer that the Alfv\'enic slow wind is likely solar wind originating from open-field regions with speeds below the maximum solar wind speed for plasma from intermittently open regions. We then discuss possible implications for solar wind heating and acceleration. Finally, we utilize the combination of helium abundance and normalized cross helicity to present a novel solar wind categorization scheme.

arXiv:2412.00519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light volatile elements in lunar regolith are thought to be a mixture of the solar wind and Earth's atmosphere, the latter sourced in the absence of geomagnetic field. However, the extent to which both the current and primitive geodynamo influence the transport of terrestrial ions still remains unclear, and this uncertainty is further complicated by the enigmatic composition and poorly constrained location of the Eoarchean exosphere. Here we use 3-D MHD numerical simulations with present-day magnetized and Archean unmagnetized atmospheres to investigate how Earth's intrinsic magnetic field affects this transfer, aiming to constrain how and when the lunar isotopic signature provides a record of Earth's paleoatmosphere. We find that atmospheric transfer is efficient only when the Moon is within Earth's magnetotail. The non-solar contribution to the lunar soil is best explained by implantation during the long history of the geodynamo, rather than any short, putatively unmagnetized epoch of early Earth. This further suggests the history of the terrestrial atmosphere, spanning billions of years, could be preserved in buried lunar soils. Our results indicate that the elemental abundances of Apollo samples are very sensitive to Earth's exobase altitude, which, at the time of ion implantation, was never smaller than 190 km.

# Field-induced quantum interference of inelastic scattering in ultracold atomic collisions

arXiv:2412.00743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: xploiting quantum interference remains a significant challenge in ultracold inelastic scattering. In this work, we propose a method to enable detectable quantum interference within the two-body loss rate resulting from various inelastic scattering channels. Our approach utilizes a ``ring-coupling" configuration, achieved by combining external radio-frequency and static electric fields during ultracold atomic collisions. We conduct close-coupling calculations for $^7$Li-$^{41}$K collisions at ultracold limit to validate our proposal. The results show that the interference profile displayed in two-body loss rate is unable to be observed with unoptimized external field parameters. Particularly, our findings demonstrate that the two-body loss rate coefficient exhibits distinct constructive and destructive interference patterns near the magnetically induced $p$-wave resonance in the incoming channel near which a rf-induced scattering resonance exists. These interference patterns become increasingly pronounced with greater intensities of the external fields. This work opens a new avenue for controlling inelastic scattering processes in ultracold collisions.

arXiv:2412.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explicit expression for the photon polarization operator in the presence of a single electron is found in the $in$-$in$ formalism in the one-loop approximation out of the photon mass-shell. This polarization operator describes the dielectric permittivity of a single electron wave packet in coherent scattering processes. The plasmons and plasmon-polaritons supported by a single electron wave packet are described. The two limiting cases are considered: the wavelength of the external electromagnetic field is much smaller than the typical scale of variations of the electron wave packet and the wavelength of the external electromagnetic field is much larger than the size of the electron wave packet. In the former case, there are eight independent plasmon-polariton modes. In the latter case, the plasmons boil down to the dynamical dipole moment attached to a point electron. Thus, in the infrared limit, the electron possesses a dynamical electric dipole moment manifesting itself in coherent scattering processes.

Abstract: We explore the use of magnonic Fabry-P\'erot resonators as programmable phase shifters for spin-wave computing. The resonator, composed of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film coupled with a CoFeB nanostripe, operates through dynamic dipolar coupling, leading to wavelength downconversion and the formation of a magnonic cavity. Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect (SNS-MOKE) microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that these resonators can induce a $\pi$ phase shift in the transmitted spin wave. The phase shift is highly sensitive to the magnetization alignment within the resonator, allowing for on-demand control via magnetic switching. This feature, combined with low-loss transmission, positions the magnonic Fabry-P\'erot resonator as a promising component for reconfigurable magnonic circuits and spin-wave computing devices.

Abstract: Relativistic pair beams produced in the intergalactic medium (IGM) by TeV gamma rays from blazars are expected to generate a detectable GeV-scale electromagnetic cascade, yet this cascade is absent in the observed spectra of hard-spectrum TeV emitting blazars. This suppression is often attributed to weak intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) deflecting electron-positron pairs out of the line of sight. Alternatively, it has been proposed that beam-plasma instabilities could drain the energy of the beam before they produce the secondary cascades. Recent studies suggest that the modification of beam distribution due to these instabilities is primarily driven by particle scattering, rather than energy loss. In this paper, we quantitatively assess, for the blazar 1ES 0229+200, the arrival time of secondary gamma rays at Earth from the beam scattering by the electrostatic instability. We first computed the production rates of electron-positron pairs at various distances using the Monte Carlo simulation CRPropa. We then simulated the feedback of the plasma instability on the beam, incorporating production rates and inverse-Compton cooling, to determine the steady-state distribution function. Our findings reveal that the time delay of the GeV secondary cascade arrival due to instability broadening is on the order of a few months. This delay is insufficient to account for the missing cascade emission in blazar spectra, suggesting that plasma instabilities do not significantly affect IGMF constraints.

Abstract: In recent decades, significant progress has been made in construction and study of individual quantum systems consisting of the basic single matter and energy particles, i.e., atoms and photons, which show great potentials in quantum computation and communication. Here, we demonstrate that the quadruply-bonded Mo$_2$ unit of the complex can trap photons of visible light under ambient conditions, producing intense local electromagnetic (EM) field that features squeezed states, photon antibunching, and vacuum Rabi splitting. Our results show that both the electronic and vibrational states of the Mo$_2$ molecule are modified by coherent coupling with the scattered photons of the Mo$_2$ unit, as evidenced by the Rabi doublet4 and the Mollow triplet in the incoherent resonance fluorescence and the Raman spectra. The Mo$_2$ molecule, acting as an independent emitter-resonator integrated quantum system, allows optical experiments to be conducted in free space, enabling fundamental quantum phenomena to be observed through conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This provides a new platform for study of field effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the optical domain. The insights gained from this study advance our understanding in metal-metal bond chemistry, molecular physics and quantum optics, with applications in quantum information processing, optoelectronic devices and control of chemical reactivity.

Abstract: A 2D electromagnetic-thermal coupled numerical model has been developed using the finite element method and validated against experimental data to investigate a superconducting machine featuring high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape stacks and cryocooled iron cores. The HTS stacks are transformed into trapped field stacks (TFSs) through pulsed field magnetisation (PFM), generating rotor fields. After PFM, the superconducting motor operates on the same principle as permanent magnet synchronous motors. This study explores the behaviour of HTS stacks by altering the stack's layer number from one to nine and adjusting the pulsed current amplitude from 250 A to 1000 A. The primary objective of this paper is to identify the optimal combination of pulsed current amplitudes and TFS layer numbers for achieving maximum magnetisation fields. The secondary objective is to evaluate the overall losses in both superconducting and non-superconducting parts of the machine during magnetisation, including heat generated in various layers of the TFS, and losses in the motor's active materials (copper windings and iron cores). Two motor configurations were proposed, and two calculation methods using linear interpolation of iron losses and steel grades were introduced to estimate the iron losses for the studied iron material, M270-35A. This pioneering study is expected to serve as a valuable reference for loss analyses and structural design considerations in developing superconducting machines.

# Forced 3D reconnection in an exponentially separating magnetic field

## 在指数分离的磁场中强制3D重新连接

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01736

arXiv:2412.01736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solvable scenario for 3D reconnection in a sheared magnetic field. We consider a localized external force that is applied slowly and then maintained, generating an Alfv\'{e}nic perturbation that spreads along the field lines. Separation of the sheared field lines causes the scale of the perturbation across the field to decrease, enabling magnetic diffusion to be enhanced. For a fusion-motivated equilibrium with exponential field-line separation, we find a reconnection timescale proportional to $S/\ln S$ under magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and to $S^{1/3}$ for semi-collisional electron-only reconnection, where $S$ is the Lundquist number of the perturbed flux tube. We generalize these results to arbitrary magnetic geometries, showing that the latter is geometry-independent. Interestingly, we find that slower field-line separation yields an increased reconnection rate in MHD.

Abstract: We present an empirical model for auroral (90--150 km) electron--ion pair production rates, ionization rates for short, derived from SSUSI (Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager) electron energy and flux data. Using the Fang et al., 2010 parametrization for mono-energetic electrons, and the NRLMSISE-00 neutral atmosphere model, the calculated ionization rate profiles are binned in 2-h magnetic local time (MLT) and 3.6$^{\circ}$ geomagnetic latitude to yield time series of ionization rates at 5-km altitude steps. We fit each of these time series to the geomagnetic indices Kp, PC, and Ap, the 81-day averaged solar F$_{\text{10.7}}$ radio flux index, and a constant term. The resulting empirical model can easily be incorporated into coupled chemistry--climate models to include particle precipitation effects.

Abstract: Sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive and specific to ionic balance of cells owing to 10 fold difference in sodium concentration across membrane actively maintained by sodium potassium (Na+ K+) pump. Disruption of the pump and membrane integrity, as seen in neurological disorders such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, bipolar disease, and mild traumatic brain injury, leads to a large increase in intracellular sodium. Such a cellular level alteration is however overshadowed by large signal from extracellular sodium, leaving behind a long standing pursuit to separate signals from sodium exhibiting mono vs biexponential transverse (T2) decay under the inherent constraint of low signal to noise ratio even at advanced clinical field of 3 Tesla. Here we propose a novel technique that exploits intrinsic difference in their T2 decays by simply acquiring single quantum images at multiple echo times (TEs) and performing accurate matrix inversion at voxel. This approach was then investigated using numerical models, agar phantoms and human subjects, showing high accuracy of the separation in phantoms (95.8 percent for monoT2 and 72.5 to 80.4 percent for biT2) and clinical feasibility in humans. Thus, sodium MRI at 3T can now facilitate detection of neurological disorders early at cellular level and response to treatment as well.

Abstract: We report on measurements of 1 and 1.5 MeV monoenergetic electrons with a Timepix3-based detector using a 0.5 mm thick silicon sensor. A $^{90}$Sr $\beta$-emitting radioisotope was used as the source of electrons, and a monochromator equipped with an adjustable magnetic field was employed to only pass electrons of desired energy into the detector. We provide experimental results of deposited-energy spectrum in the sensor and linearity of detected tracks. Alongside with the experiment, the whole system has been modelled in software and a Monte Carlo Geant4 / Allpix$^2$ simulation of the experiment has been carried out. Generally, we find a good agreement between the two.

# A frequency tunable low-noise YIG-GGG based oscillator with strong magneto-elastic coupling

Abstract: We present a frequency tunable magneto-acoustic oscillator (MAO) operating in low-phase-noise and complex dynamical regimes based on a single composite YIG-GGG resonator. The magneto-acoustic resonator (MAR) is based on a YIG (yttrium iron garnet) layer epitaxially grown on a GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet) substrate. By optimizing the YIG thickness, we obtain a high magneto-elastic coupling of around 1 MHz between the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in YIG and high overtone acoustic resonances (HBARs) in the YIG-GGG structure in the 1-2 GHz frequency range. It allows to eliminate the need for pre-selectors and bulky circulators, thus simplifying the MAO design while maintaining the possibility to lock to HBAR YIG-GGG modes. With an adjustment in the loop over-amplification parameter, the MAO can be locked either only to high-Q magneto-acoustic HBARs or to both types of resonance including HBARs and the FMR mode of the YIG film. In a low-phase-noise regime, MAO generates only at certain values of the applied field and exhibits discrete frequency tunability with a 3.281 MHz step corresponding to the frequency separation between the adjacent HBAR modes in a YIG-GGG structure. In a complex regime where oscillation conditions expand to include both HBAR and FMR modes, MAO demonstrates continuous generation as the function of the applied field with variable phase noise parameters. Moreover, in low-phase-noise regime, MAO phase noise plot improves by 30 dB compared to the operational regime locked to the pure FMR in YIG which is in agreement with the measured FMR and HBAR Q-factors.

# Degrees of Freedom for Radiating Systems

arXiv:2404.08976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic degrees of freedom are instrumental in antenna design, wireless communications, imaging, and scattering. Larger number of degrees of freedom enhances control in antenna design, influencing radiation patterns and directivity, while in communication systems, it links to spatial channels for increased data rates and reliability, and resolution in imaging. The correlation between computed degrees of freedom and physical quantities is not fully understood, prompting a comparison between classical estimates, Weyl's law, modal expansions, and optimization techniques. In this paper, it is shown that the number of degrees of freedom for arbitrary shaped radiating structures approaches the shadow area measured in squared wavelengths asymptotically as the wavelength decreases.

# Dark state transport between unitary Fermi superfluids

arXiv:2406.03104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of dark states is an important concept in quantum sciences, but its compatibility with strong interparticle interactions -- for example, in a quantum degenerate gas -- is hardly explored. Here, we realize a dark state in one of the spins of a two-component, resonantly interacting Fermi gas using a $\Lambda$ system within the $D_2$ transitions of $^6$Li at high magnetic field. The dark state is created in a micrometer-sized region within a one-dimensional channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs. The particle transport between the reservoirs is used as a probe. We observe that atoms are transported in the dark state and the superfluid-assisted fast current is preserved. If the dark state resonant condition is not met, the transport is suppressed by the spontaneous emission. We also uncover an asymmetry in the transport timescale across the two-photon resonance, which is absent in the non-interacting regime and diminished at higher temperatures. This work raises questions on the interplay of dark states with interparticle interactions and opens up perspectives for optical manipulation of fermionic pairing.

Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a rotating massive body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level in terms of the osculating Keplerian orbital elements. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit, and to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.

Purpose: To investigate and compare metabolic and perfusion alterations in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients via hybrid 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Methods: Twenty-one TLE patients (15 with left-sided TLE (LTLE) and 6 with right-sided TLE (RTLE)) who underwent brain 18F-FDG PET/MRI, and eight healthy controls (Hc) who had 18F-FDG PET/MRI for health examination, were included. Brain regions were segmented based on the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template, and the hippocampus and temporal lobe were isolated for further analysis. Left and right sides of these structures were analyzed separately. Accordingly, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were compared between the two sides via paired t test. Asymmetry indexes (AI) were calculated and statistically compared between the TLE patients and Hc, along with PET and Arterial spin labeling (ASL)-derived AI.
Results: LTLE patients showed significant asymmetrical differences in SUVmax, SUVmean, and CBF within the hippocampus region (p&amp;lt;0.01). In RTLE patients, only SUVmean showed significant asymmetrical in both the hippocampus (p=0.009) and temporal lobe (p=0.018). The PET-derived AI in the hippocampus nearly doubled in the TLE group compared to Hc group. Similarly, ASL-derived AI in the hippocampus also increased (7.22% vs 3.86%) in the TLE group compared to Hc group (p=0.051). In the temporal lobe, both PET and ASL-derived AIs increased in the TLE group; however, these increases were not statistically significant (p=0.260, p=0.364). In the hippocampus, a significant difference existed for the AI between PET and ASL (p=0.001), while the temporal lobe showed a significant correlation for the AI between PET and ASL (r=0.49, p=0.024).
Conclusion: TLE patients exhibited distinct patterns of brain metabolism and perfusion between LTLE and RTLE. &amp;nbsp;And the AIs derived from PET was more accurate than those of ASL in detecting abnormalities in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, metabolism and perfusion in TLE patients differed significantly in the hippocampus, while revealing a correlation in the temporal lobe.

The photocatalysis-based technology has an insight into decreasing the disadvantages of those traditional approaches and is identified as an appropriate way to eliminate dyes and bacteria from wastewater. In this work, Fe3O4/rGO/TiO2 photocatalyst material was synthesized by a simple and fast hydrothermal method. The photocatalyst process results showed that Fe3O4/rGO/TiO2 nanocomposite degraded methylene blue dye completely in 4 min. Also, Fe3O4/rGO/TiO2 nanocomposite was very efficient (4.92 log reduction value) for E. Coli bacteria inactivation in 60 min photocatalyst process. The superparamagnetic behavior of Fe3O4/rGO/TiO2 nanocomposite was investigated by VSM analysis which gives simple and fast separation from media to Fe3O4/rGO/TiO2 nanocatalyst. The structural and morphology properties of Fe3O4/rGO/TiO2 nanocomposite were studied by XRD, Raman, FT-IR, EDS, FESEM, and TEM analysis. The obtained results confirmed that Fe3O4/rGO/TiO2 nanocomposite is an efficient nanocatalyst for MB dye removal and water disinfection.

# Bilateral pseudo-disc changes in a minipig model for unilateral anterior disc displacement of the temporomandibular joint

## 颞下颌关节单侧前椎间盘移位小型猪模型的双侧假性椎间盘变化

Objective Current animal models of anterior disc displacement (ADD) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) have primarily been developed in small animals, using sutures or elastic bands to pull the disc anteriorly. These models often exhibit severe osteoarthritis (OA) and rapid progression to late-stage ADD, which do not accurately reflect the natural course of ADD in humans. This study aimed to establish a unilateral ADD-induced surgical protocol in a minipig model and evaluate the early changes of ADD.Methods Six Bama minipigs (12 joints) were divided into 3 groups: control group (CG), ADD experimental group (ADD-EG), and contralateral experimental group (CL-EG). Nickel-titanium coil springs were used to induce mild, sustained traction to anteriorly displace the TMJ discs. After a 5-week observation period, in-vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans confirmed the anterior position of the TMJ discs.Results Micro-computed tomography showed minimal condylar bone changes, while histological analysis revealed mild OA-like condylar cartilage changes. MRI identified hypointense lesions posterior to the TMJ discs, indicative of pseudo-disc changes in the posterior attachments (PAs). Histological staining further confirmed chondroid metaplasia in the PAs surrounded by transitional zones in both ADD-EG and CL-EG.Conclusion This study successfully established a unilateral ADD-induced minipig model and identified pseudo-disc changes in the PAs under abnormal mechanical stress, which may offer new perspectives for ADD therapies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to observe bilateral pseudo-disc changes in a unilateral ADD-induced model.

Background In recent efforts to address the critical need for clean and portable water, we have focused on innovative methods to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. To this aim, the Glycyl-L-leucine peptide ligand was complexed with different transition metal ions [Cu(II), Ni(II), and Cd(II)]. The compounds were characterized and examined using various analytical methods, including elemental analysis (CHN), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and assessments of magnetic properties, molar conductivity, and thermogravimetric analysis. An N2O2 arrangement of ligand atoms coordinated all metals. The coordination sites were completed with a carbonyl oxygen atom and a water molecule. The complexes showed polymeric structures using bridging carboxylate groups.Results Their antibacterial properties were screened using disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentrations techniques against the identified bacterial organisms from the water samples collected along the Nile River. Cu(II)-chelate showed the best results for our investigation. The docking results supported and displayed that Cu(II)-chelate exhibited the minimum binding energy as compared to Ni(II), Cd(II), and free peptide which is in agreement with antibacterial results.Conclusions our study successfully demonstrated the potential of Glycyl-L-leucine peptide ligands complexed with transition metal ions, particularly Cu(II), in eliminating pathogenic microorganisms from water. Cu(II)-chelate exhibited superior antibacterial properties, as confirmed by both experimental and molecular docking results. This compound not only showed the lowest binding energy but also proved to be the most effective against bacterial and viral targets. These findings highlight the promising application of Cu(II)-chelate in developing advanced water purification systems.

# Enhancing the Therapeutic Efficacy of silibinin via Silica-Coated magnetic Nanocomposite against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and HepG2 cancer cells Running title: Potential therapeutic properties of silibinin

## 通过二氧化硅包被的磁性纳米复合材料增强水飞蓟宾对铜绿假单胞菌分离株和HepG2癌细胞的治疗效果运行标题: 水飞蓟宾的潜在治疗特性

Introduction: Silibinin is a notable component extracted from Silybum marianum with antioxidant, antitumor, hepatoprotective, and antibacterial activities.&amp;nbsp; This study aims to enhance the delivery of silibinin by synthesizing magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) to address its poor solubility in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and HepG2 cancer cells.
Methods: The physicochemical characterization of Fe3O4@SiPr@Silibinin nanocomposites was thoroughly measured via FT-IR, TGA-DTG, TEM, FE-SEM, XRD, and VSM. Clinical isolates and standard strain of P. aeruginosa were treated with Fe3O4@SiPr@Silibinin (sub-MIC) in combination with ciprofloxacin (sub-MIC) compared to treatment with sub-MIC of ciprofloxacin alone. Additionally, the anticancer effects of Fe3O4@SiPr@Silibinin were assessed on HepG2 cells.
Results: The nanocomposites had particle sizes ranging from 40 to 80 nm and significantly enhanced the antimicrobial effects of ciprofloxacin when used in combination. The Fe3O4@SiPr@Silibinin + ciprofloxacin treatment resulted in decreased expression of biofilm and efflux pump genes compared to ciprofloxacin treatment alone. Fe3O4@SiPr@Silibinin (IC50=35.79 &micro;g/mL) also demonstrated anti-cancer activity against HepG2 cells. In Silibinin treated HepG2 cells, overexpression of the P53 gene and under-expression of the Bcl2 gene were observed.
Discussion: Our anulysis suggests that Fe3O4@SiPr@Silibinin&amp;nbsp; MNCs, with high stablilty and high solublity in water, can more efficiently transfer silibinin into pathogenic and tumorigenic cells, thus&amp;nbsp; increasing its therapeutic functions against P. aeruginosa and HepG2 cells. Given the antimicrobial and anti-tumor properties of silibinin, these magnetic nanocarriers may represent &amp;nbsp;a novel strategy for its targeted delivery.

# Quantum state control of a ground state H2 dissociation reaction.

## 基态H2解离反应的量子态控制。

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5263503/latest

When hydrogen molecules collide with a surface, they can either scatter away from the surface or undergo a dissociation reaction leaving two hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the surface. The relative probabilities of these two potential outcomes could depend on the rotational orientation of the impinging molecules, however, due to the lack of steric control techniques for ground state hydrogen, direct measurements of this dependency were previously inaccessible to experiments. Here, we demonstrate that magnetic field manipulation can be used to control the rotational orientation of the impinging H2 and change the balance between reactive and scattering collision events. Analysing the controlled collision experiments reveals that molecules approaching the surface in a helicopter orientation have a higher probability to react and dissociate, whereas those which approach in a cartwheel orientation are more likely to scatter.

# Ferrotoroidicity in Cs2FeCl5&middot;D2O

## Cs2FeCl5·D2O中的铁性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5076300/latest

The promise of antiferromagnetic spintronics largely relies on the possibilities of electrical manipulation of antiferromagnetic states, which requires the exploration of innovative material platforms to meet the challenge. Erythrosiderite-type compounds constitute a class of non-oxide materials presenting magneto-electric couplings ranging from multiferroicity to linear magneto-electric behaviour. In this communication, we demonstrate that Cs2[FeCl5(D2O)] shows evidence of another ferroic order, ferrotoroidicity, providing an alternative way of manipulating the magnetic states. The magnetic structure of this compound (a collinear antiferromagnet with moments along b) allows a toroidal moment in the ac-plane. We have used spherical neutron polarimetry on a single crystal of Cs2[FeCl5(D2O)] cooled in different configurations of applied electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields to show that the toroidal domains can be selected by a conjugate field (ExH) coupling with the c-component of the toroidal moment. The extraordinary sensitivity of spherical neutron polarimetry allows detecting and quantifying this toroidal domain selection.

# Origin and stability of generalized Wigner crystallinity in triangular moir&eacute; systems

## 三角莫尔系统中广义Wigner结晶度的起源和稳定性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5422937/latest

Generalized Wigner crystals (GWC) on triangular moir&eacute; superlattices, formed from stacking two layers of transition metal chalcogenides, have been recently observed at multiple fractional fillings of the moir&eacute; unit cell [Y. Xu et al., Nature 587, 214 - 218 (2020), X. Huang et al. Nat. Phys. 17, 715 - 719 (2021), H. Li et al., Nature 597, 650 - 654 (2021)]. Motivated by these experiments, tied with the need for an accurate microscopic description of these materials, we explore the theoretical origins of GWC at $n=1/3$ and $2/3$ filling. We demonstrate the limitations of theoretical descriptions of these moir&eacute; GWCs relying on truncated (finite-range) electron-electron interactions instead of a long-range Coulomb interaction. We validate our findings by studying both classical and quantum mechanical effects at zero and finite temperatures. More generally, we discuss the role of charge frustration in the theoretical extended Hubbard-model phase diagram, identifying a ''pinball" phase, a partially quantum melted generalized Wigner crystal with coexisting solid and liquid-like features, with no classical analog. Quantum effects also explain the small, but experimentally detectable, asymmetry in the transition temperatures of the n=1/3 and 2/3 crystals. Our calculations reveal that the charge ordering temperature and the magnetic crossover temperature predicted using the long-range Coulomb interaction are correctly captured with appropriately renormalized nearest-neighbor interactions. The effective nearest-neighbor interaction strength is significantly weaker than previously reported, placing it close to a metal-insulator phase boundary. This observation has implications for future experiments that we discuss. We conclude by studying the dependence of melting temperatures on gate-to-sample separationand we also predict temperature scales at which magnetic crossovers should be observed.

This paper presents a performance evaluation of the African Regional Ionospheric Total Electron Content (AfriTEC) model during both quiet and disturbed conditions from the solar maximum year of 2014 and the solar minimum year of 2009 in the East African sector. The analysis was conducted using data from GPS receivers with IGSS stations located at (geographic lat and long: for ADIS 9.03oN &amp;nbsp;38.76oE, BDMT 11.6oN 37.35oE, MOIU 0.28oN 35.29oE, MAL2 -2.99oS 40.19oE, DODM -6.17oS &amp;nbsp;35.75oE and MBAR 0.60oS 30.65oE). The AfriTEC model provides output data in folder, which is &amp;nbsp;consistent with the derived GPS-TEC data. Geomagnetic indices data of Kp values ranging from 0 to &amp;nbsp;4.2 for 2014 and from 0 to 3 for 2009 and Dst index value between 20 to -65 for 2014 and 2009 year its &amp;nbsp;value ranging 10 to -50 nT were obtained from the OMNIWEB data source. The monthly, seasonal, and &amp;nbsp;diurnal characteristics of AfriTEC estimates for the equatorial and low latitudinal region's ionosphere &amp;nbsp;are validated by using RMSE and MAE. The MAE is typically greater than 1.3 for all stations, &amp;nbsp;indicating a strong correlation between the observations and related predictions. The paper also &amp;nbsp;discusses the validation of the AfriTEC ionospheric model to ensure its accuracy and reliability under &amp;nbsp;both quiet and disturbed conditions in the East African region.
