Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and magnetism is an important subject in condensed matter physics. EuFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$-based iron pnictides could offer an interesting plateau to study their relationship that has attracted considerable attention. So far, two magnetic phase transitions were observed in EuFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$-based crystal, which were deemed to originate from the itinerant Fe moments ($\sim$ 190 K) and the localized Eu$^{2+}$ moments ($\sim$ 19 K), respectively. Here, we systematically studied the heat capacity for the EuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ crystals with \textit{x} = 0.21 (optimally doped) and \textit{x} = 0.29 (overdoped). We have found two new magnetic orders in the superconducting state (ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 K) in the optimally doped crystal. As more P was introduced into the As site, one of the magnetic orders becomes absent in the overdoped crystal. Additionally, we observed strong field and orientation dependence in heat capacity. The present findings in EuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ have detected the new low-temperature magnetic orders, which may originate from the localized Eu$^{2+}$ spins order or the spin reorientation.

arXiv:2412.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic pinning is caused by natural pinning centers that occur because of the modulation of the order parameter or weak superconducting layers. Early work has shown that intrinsic pinning generates a high pinning force and critical current density in some layered oxide superconductors. Studying the intrinsic pinning of superconductors is crucial for both fundamental studies and potential applications. Herein, we use torque magnetometry to study angle-resolved in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic torque for a series of high-quality FeSe$_1$$_-$$_x$S$_x$ single crystals. A fourfold torque signal was observed when the magnetic field was within the \textit{ab} plane. We interpret that this fourfold in-plane irreversible torque is from the intrinsic pinning due to combined effects of gap nodes/minimum and twin domains. Additionally, we attributed the observed out-of-plane torque peaks to intrinsic pinning due to the layered structure.

Abstract: Recent investigations of FeSe-based superconductors have revealed the presence of two superconducting domes, and suggest possible distinct pairing mechanisms. Two superconducting domes are commonly found in unconventional superconductors and exhibit unique normal states and electronic structures. In this study, we conducted electromagnetic transport measurements to establish a complete phase diagram, successfully observing the two superconducting domes in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (0 $\le x \le$ 0.25) and FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ (0 $\le x \le$ 1) superconductors. The normal state resistivity on SC1 shows the strange metal state, with a power exponent approximately equal to 1 ($\rho (T)\propto T^n$ with $n\sim 1$), whereas the exponent on SC2 is less than 1. A bulk Dirac state observed on SC1, completely synchronized with the strange metal behavior, indicating a close relationship between them. While a topological surface Dirac state is witnessed on SC2, and undergoes a sign change near the pure nematic quantum critical point. The evolution of the Dirac states indicates that the appearance of the two superconducting domes may originate from the Fermi surface reconstruction. Our findings highlight distinct Dirac states and normal state resistivity across the two superconducting domes, providing convincing evidence for the existence of the two different pairing mechanisms in FeSe-based superconductors.

arXiv:2412.16173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an analysis of magnetic properties of weak ferrimagnets of the YFe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$ type. Taking into account the main spin interactions - isotropic Heisenberg superexchange, antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange, single-ion spin anisotropy - calculations of the free energy, concentration and temperature dependences of magnetization were carried out within a framework of a molecular field model. In particular, the model demonstrates the phenomena of temperature compensation and negative magnetization, as well as spin reorientation. The compensation temperature reaches room temperature T = 300 K in a composition with x = 0.45. The existence of magnetic structures of the $G_{xyz}$ type with the spatial orientation of the Neel vector is predicted.

arXiv:2412.16221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has recently been demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting electronics, which features an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, compared to the conventional thermally-growth SiO2. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.

# Topological dipoles of quantum skyrmions

## 量子斯基米子的拓扑偶极子

**Authors:** Sopheak Sorn, J\"org Schmalian, Markus Garst

arXiv:2412.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are spatially localized whirls of spin moments in two dimension, featuring a nontrivial topological charge and a well-defined topological charge density. We demonstrate that the quantum dynamics of magnetic skyrmions is governed by a dipole conservation law associated with the topological charge, akin to that in fracton theories of excitations with constrained mobility. The dipole conservation law enables a natural definition of the collective coordinate to specify the skymion's position, which ultimately leads to a greatly simplified equation of motion in the form of the Thiele equation. In this formulation, the skyrmion mass, whose existence is often debated, actually vanishes. As a result, an isolated skyrmion is intrinsically pinned to be immobile and cannot move at a constant velocity. In a spin-wave theory, we show that such dynamics corresponds to a precise cancellation between a highly nontrivial motion of the quasi-classical skyrmion spin texture and a cloud of quantum fluctuations in the form of spin waves. Given this quenched kinetic energy of quantum skyrmions, we identify close analogies to the bosonic quantum Hall problem. In particular, the topological charge density is shown to obey the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra that describes neutral modes of the lowest Landau level in the fractional quantum Hall problem. Consequently, the conservation of the topological dipole suggests that magnetic skyrmion materials offer a promising platform for exploring fractonic phenomena with close analogies to fractional quantum Hall states.

arXiv:2412.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whilst atomic resolution imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has revolutionized science and technology, it cannot see things happening out of the plane of the image and merely forms projection images. In this article we show that it is possible to directly map the direction and magnitude of atom displacements at 30{\deg} to the imaging plane in a La2CoMnO6 thin film on (111) LSAT (LaAlO3-(Sr,Ta)AlO3) using a 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4DSTEM) methodology. The interpretation is backed up by analysis of theoretical simulations. We reveal that the b-axis always lies in the plane of interface in every area we looked at, and that the atom modulation is strongly suppressed close to the epitaxial interface. This crystallographic detail was not previously revealed or visible by conventional STEM imaging and the new methodology sheds a lot more light on why this particular substrate in this orientation best promotes double perovskite cation ordering and consequently the best achieved magnetic ordering in this thin film system. This approach of fitting atomic resolution 4DSTEM data to determine crystal parameters opens the door for a new era of atomic-resolution crystallography.

arXiv:2412.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporation of manganese impurities into II-VI semiconductors results in a dramatic change in their properties due to strong exchange interactions between the Mn ion and the semiconductor host. In colloidal quantum dots (QDs), these interactions result in a rapid bidirectional energy transfer between the magnetic impurity and the QD intrinsic states, which is characterized by an extremely high energy transfer rate of more than ~5 eV/ps. This rate is higher than the rate of energy loss due to phonon emission (typically, ~1 eV/ps or less), so Mn-QD interactions could in principle be used to capture and utilize the kinetic energy of the hot carrier before it is lost to phonons. Here, we demonstrate that by using Mn-doped CdSe/HgSe core/shell QDs, we can efficiently convert the kinetic energy of a hot exciton into an additional electron-hole pair (exciton). This carrier multiplication process occurs through rapid capture of a hot exciton by a Mn ion, which then undergoes spin flip relaxation, producing two excitons near the QD band edge. Due to the inverted geometry of the CdSe/HgSe QDs, both electrons and holes resulting from carrier multiplication occupy the QD shell, allowing them to be easily extracted from the QD for potential use in electro-optical devices or chemical reactions.

# Altermagnetism in modified Lieb lattice Hubbard model

**Authors:** Nitin Kaushal, Marcel Franz

arXiv:2412.16421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of altermagnetism from repulsive interactions for electrons on the Lieb lattice as a model of quasi-2D oxychalcogenides with the so-called "anti-CuO$_{2}$" latice structure. A comprehensive study of the Lieb lattice Hubbard model, using unrestricted Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization techniques, establishes the presence of spin-${1\over 2}$ altermagnetic Mott insulating ground state for average electron densities of 2 and 4 per unit cell. Both phases show the characteristic spin splitting in the electron bands as well as in the magnon bands, as indicated by solutions of an effective spin-${1\over 2}$ Heisenberg model that we construct. We also provide evidence for altermagnetic metal formation in the electron- and hole-doped Mott state, giving rise to Fermi surfaces with $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave spin splitting and quasi-one-dimensional characteristics.

Abstract: The origin of the magnetic quadrupole (MQ) interactions in Gd$_{3}$Ru$_{4}$Al$_{12}$ which is known as a frustrated spin system and as a host material of skyrmion with a sentrosymmetric crystal structure are discussed. The MQ interactions between ferromagnetic (FM) spin trimers with imperfect FM directivity are deduced from synthesis of dipole Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. The Hamiltonian which includes both the MQ interactions and dipole interactions is proposed, and magnetic anisotropies, magnetic phase transitions and contribution of the MQ interactions to stabilize the skyrmion lattice (SkL) are discussed based on this Hamiltonian. Degrees of MQ freedom carried by the trimers contribute to stabilizing SkL which appears at finite temperatures.

Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI nanowire based Josephson junction.

Abstract: Excitons in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) acquire a spin-like quantum number, a pseudospin, originating from the crystal's discrete rotational symmetry. Here, we break this symmetry using a tunable uniaxial strain, effectively generating a pseudomagnetic field exceeding 40 Tesla. Under this large field, we demonstrate pseudospin analogs of spintronic phenomena such as the Zeeman effect and Larmor precession. Moreover, we determine previously inaccessible fundamental properties of TMDs, including the strength of the depolarizing field responsible for the loss of exciton coherence. Finally, we uncover the bosonic -- as opposed to fermionic -- nature of many-body excitonic species using the pseudomagnetic equivalent of the $g$-factor spectroscopy. Our work is the first step toward establishing this spectroscopy as a universal method for probing correlated many-body states and realizing pseudospin analogs of spintronic devices.

Abstract: The discovery of bilayer nickelate superconductors under high pressure has opened a new chapter in high-transition temperature (high-TC) superconductivity. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset above the McMillan limit (40 K) in bilayer nickelate epitaxial ultrathin films. Three-unit-cell (3UC) thick La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 single-phase-crystalline films are grown using the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy) on SrLaAlO4 substrates. Resistivity measurements and magnetic-field responses indicate onset TC = 45 K. The transition to zero resistance exhibits characteristics consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-like behavior, with TBKT = 9 K. Meissner diamagnetic effect is observed at TM = 8.5 K via a mutual inductance setup, in agreement with the BKT-like transition. In-plane and out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exhibit anisotropy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and X-ray reciprocal space mappings (RSMs) show that the films maintain a tetragonal phase with coherent epitaxial compressive strain ~2% in the NiO2 planes relative to the bulk. Our findings pave the way for comprehensive investigations of nickelate superconductors under ambient pressure conditions and for exploring superconductivity at higher transition temperature through strain engineering in heterostructures.

Abstract: A theory for nontrivial topology of band structure in metallic helimagnets is developed. Two theorems on electron dispersion in helimagnets are proved. They reveal a Kramers-like degeneracy in helical magnetic field. The generalized Bloch theorem together with periodic boundary conditions lead to a nontrivial topological band structure. As a result, an unusual spin structure of electron bands appears. A 2D model of nearly free electrons is proposed to describe conductive hexagonal palladium layers under an effective field of magnetically ordered CrO$_2$ spacers in PdCrO$_2$. The spin texture of the Fermi surface induces abnormal conductivity and nonreciprocity of electronic transport. It is shown that the topological metal state is closely related to unconventional antiferromagnets.

Abstract: We carry out first-principles calculations to demonstrate that the complex energy landscape and competing phases of HfO$_2$ can be understood from the four unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure of HfO$_2$ with the space group $Cmma$. We consider structures generated from the $Cmma$ reference structure by all possible combinations of the zone center and zone boundary modes belonging to the unstable flat phonon branches. We find 12 distinct locally-stable structures, of which 5 correspond to well-known phases. We show that 6 of these 7 remaining structures can be described as period-2 superlattices of the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ (o-FE), ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$ (o-FE2), and and monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (m) structures. We demonstrate how the unstable flat phonon bands can explain the atomically thin grain boundaries in the various types of superlattices. Finally, we point out that arbitrary-period HfO$_2$ superlattices derived from the 6 different types of period-2 superlattices are expected to form based on the flatness of the unstable phonon branches. The organizing principle provided by this work deepens our understanding of the underlying physics in the phase stability of HfO$_2$ and provides guidance for functional phase stabilization.

Abstract: Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity, etc. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and, thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a unidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with orbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that the band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3 nesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an orbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding and the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau in this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.

Abstract: The development of Mn-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries promises to alleviate supply chain bottlenecks in battery manufacturing. Challenges in Mn-rich cathodes arise from Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions of Mn$^{3+}$, Mn migration, and phase transformations to spinel-like order, which can affect the electrochemical performance. These phenomena motivate an ab initio re-examination of the thermodynamics of the LiMnO2 polymorphs. It is found that the generalized gradient approximation (GGA - PBEsol) and meta-GGA (r2SCAN) density functionals with empirical on-site Hubbard U corrections yield spurious stable phases for LiMnO2, such as predicting a phase with gamma-LiFeO2-like order (g-LiMnO2) to be the ground state instead of the orthorhombic (Pmmn) phase, which is the experimentally known ground state. Accounting for the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in each structure has a substantial effect on the total energies and resulting phase stability. By using hybrid-GGA (HSE06) and GGA with extended Hubbard parameters (on-site U and inter-site V) that are self-consistently determined, the experimentally observed LiMnO2 phase stability trends are recovered. The calculated Hubbard U in the experimentally observed orthorhombic, layered, and spinel phases (around 5.8 eV) are significantly smaller than U in g-LiMnO2 and disordered layered structures (around 6.4 eV). The smaller values of U are correlated with a collinear ordering of JT distortions, in which all $e_g$ orbitals are oriented in the same direction. This cooperative JT effect leads to increased Mn-O covalency, which contributes to the greater electronic stability compared to the phases with noncollinear JT arrangements, and also generate greater vibrational entropy, which helps stabilize these phases at high temperature. These phases are shown to be strongly insulating with large calculated band gaps > 3 eV, computed using HSE06 and $G_0W_0$.

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently discovered class of magnetic order characterized by vanishing net magnetization and spin-splitting band structures, has garnered significant research attention. In this work, we introduce a novel two-dimensional system that exhibits $g$-wave altermagnetism and undergoes a strain-induced transition from $g$-wave to $d$-wave altermagnetism. This system can be realized in an unconventional monolayer Cairo pentagonal lattice, for which we present a realistic tight-binding model that incorporates both magnetic and non-magnetic sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-trivial band topology can emerge in this system by breaking the symmetry that protects the spin-polarized nodal points. Finally, \emph{ab initio} calculations on several candidate materials, such as FeS$_2$ and Nb$_2$FeB$_2$, which exhibit symmetry consistent with the proposed tight-binding Hamiltonian, are also presented. These findings open new avenues for exploring spintronic devices based on altermagnetic systems.

Abstract: We present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study of the iron-based superconductor Ba$_{0.75}$K$_{0.25}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, focusing on its spin dynamics. Our measurements reveal a periodic intensity modulation of magnetic signals along the out-of-plane direction, which deviates from the behavior typically expected for two-dimensional magnetic materials. Using an effective model derived from density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the observed out-of-plane modulated spin susceptibility originates from the intrinsic three-dimensionality of the electronic band structure. Our study reveals the limitations of the widely assumed two-dimensional nature of spin susceptibility in iron-based superconductors, highlighting the importance of incorporating three-dimensional aspects of the electronic band structure for accurate modeling of spin dynamics.

Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposed as an elementary symmetry for physics beyond the Standard Model has found important applications in various areas outside high-energy physics. Here, we systematically implement supersymmetric quantum mechanics -- exhibiting fundamental SUSY properties in the simple setting of quantum mechanics -- into a wide range of topological semimetals, where the broken translational symmetry, e.g., by a magnetic field, is effectively captured by a SUSY potential. We show that the dynamical SUSY breaking via the instanton effect over the SUSY potential valleys works as the underlying mechanism for the gap opening of the topological semimetallic phases, and the magnitude of the instanton effect is proportional to the energy gap. This instanton mechanism provides a simple criterion for determining whether the energy gap has been opened, without resorting to detailed calculations, i.e., a finite energy gap is opened if and only if the SUSY potential has an even number of zeros. Our theory leads to previously unexpected results: even an infinitesimal magnetic field can open a gap in topologically robust Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases due to the dynamical SUSY breaking. Overall, the revealed connection between SUSY quantum mechanics and non-uniform topological semimetals can elucidate previously ambiguous phenomena, provide guidance for future investigations, and open a new avenue for exploring topological semimetals.

Abstract: We report the magnetization and the $^{51}$V NMR measurements in the polar magnet GaV$_4$Se$_8$ in which a magnetic skyrmion lattice appears in the structural domain with the polar axis parallel to the magnetic field. Although we successfully separate the $^{51}$V NMR signals in the domain from those in the other structural domains, only the high-frequency region of NMR spectrum is observed due to a significant increase of the spin-echo decay rate in the low-frequency region. In $B_{\rm{ext}}\parallel[111]$, we find the NMR signals from the supermagnetized cycloidal state in the parallel domains as well as from the conical state in domains where the polar axis is tilted from the magnetic field. No NMR signal from the skyrmion lattice state is observed, suggesting a significant increase of the decay rate by additional low-energy excitations caused by dynamics of the skyrmions. In $B_{\rm{ext}}\parallel[001]$, where all the structural domains are magnetically equivalent, multiple NMR peaks converge into one peak at the saturation magnetic field. This field dependence is explained by the closing of magnetic cones as approaching the forced-ferromagnetic state.

Abstract: The magnetic topological phases attract much interest, such as the axion insulator, higher-order topology, Weyl semimetals, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Here, we predict that the axion insulator phase, magnetic Weyl points, and QAHE can be achieved in Eu3In2As4. Recently, the single-crystal Eu3In2As4 has been successfully synthesized, which exhibits an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Our first-principles calculations show that it lies on the phase boundary between multiple magnetic topological phases, and the magnetic anisotropy is weak, with an energy difference less than 1 meV. In the AFM state, it can be tuned to an axion insulator by tensile strain. The quantized axion angle $\theta = \pi$ and the magnetic higher-order topology are characterized by the parity index $Z_4 = 2$. By applying an external magnetic field, the induced ferromagnetic (FM) state becomes an ideal magnetic topological semimetal with a single pair of Weyl points or a nodal ring. The QAHE can be achieved in FM multilayer films of Eu3In2As4 on a magnetic insulating substrate.

Abstract: Due to nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE), altermagnets can generate time-reversal-odd spin current and spin splitting torque (SST) with spin polarization parallel to the N\'eel vector. Hence the effective manipulation of SST would provide plenty of opportunities for designable spintronic devices, which remains elusive. Here, the electrical control of SST is achieved in altermagnetic RuO2, based on controllable N\'eel vector of RuO2 and N\'eel vector-dependent generation of SST. We demonstrate the current-induced switching of N\'eel vector via spin-orbit torque in RuO2 films, according to the reversible polarity of electrical transport measurements and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD). The XMLD also unprecedentedly demonstrates that N\'eel vector really exists in altermagnets. The switching of N\'eel vector to the current direction and resultantly enhanced spin polarization parallel to the N\'eel vector brings about stronger ASSE-induced spin current. Our findings not only enrich the properties of altermagnets but also pave the way for high speed memories and nano-oscillators with excellent controllability and efficiency.

Abstract: The emerging altermagnetic RuO2 with both compensated magnetic moments and broken time-reversal symmetry possesses nontrivial magneto-electronic responses and nonrelativistic spin currents, which are closely related to magnetic easy axis. To probe the N\'eel order in RuO2, we conducted Ru M3-edge X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) measurement. For epitaxial RuO2 films, characteristic XMLD signals can be observed in either RuO2(100) and RuO2(110) at normal incidence or RuO2(001) at oblique incidence, and the signals disappear when test temperature exceeds N\'eel temperature. For nonepitaxial RuO2 films, the flat lines in the XMLD patterns of RuO2(100) and RuO2(110) demonstrate that there is no in-plane uniaxial alignment of N\'eel order in these samples, due to the counterbalanced N\'eel order of the twin crystals evidenced by X-ray diffraction phi-scan measurements. Our experimental results unambiguously demonstrate the antiferromagnetism in RuO2 films and reveal the spatial relation of N\'eel order to be parallel with RuO2 [001] crystalline axis. These research findings would deepen our understanding of RuO2 and other attractive altermagnetic materials applied in the field of spintronics.

Abstract: In Kagome magnet FeGe, the coexistence of electron correlation, charge-density wave (CDW), and magnetism renders it ideal to study their interactions. Here, we combined the optical spectroscopy and the first-principles calculations to investigate the band structures of FeGe annealed at different temperatures. Our observations reveal that the sample annealed at 320C experienced dramatic change in optical conductivity following the CDW transition. Specifically, a substantial portion of the spectral weight (SW) in the low-energy region ( < 0.4 eV) was redistributed to the high-energy region (0.8 - 1.5 eV), suggesting a reconstruction of the band structure. The sample annealed at 560 C did not exhibit a CDW transition, but its SW transfer occurred progressively from 300 to 5 K. We noticed that: i) after the CDW transition, the sample annealed at 320 C showed similar tendency of SW transfer to that of the 560 C annealed sample; ii) the high-energy SW of both materials displayed a temperature dependence consistent with the magnetic roperties. Combining the first-principles calculations, we attribute the SW transfer to the band reconstruction triggered by the distortion of Ge1 atoms induced either by annealing at 560C or by the CDW transitions. This lattice distortion affects the energies of Fe 3d orbitals. Under the influence of Hund's rule coupling, the magnetic moment of Fe atoms is enhanced. Our findings elucidate the interactions among charge, lattice, and spin in FeGe, offering pivotal insights to modulate properties of this Kagome magnet.

Abstract: Despite the tremendous interest raised by the recent realization of magnetic Weyl semimetals and the observation of giant anomalous Hall signals, most of the theories used to interpret experimental data overlook the magnetic fluctuations, which are ubiquitous in such materials and can massively impact topological and transport properties. In this work, we predict that in such magnetic topological systems, the interaction between electrons and magnons substantially destabilizes the Weyl nodes, leading to a topological phase transition below the Curie temperature. Remarkably, the sensitivity of the Weyl nodes to electron-magnon interaction depends on their spin chirality. We find that Weyl nodes with a trivial chirality are more sensitive to electron-magnon interactions than Weyl nodes presenting an inverted chirality, demonstrating the resilience of the latter compared to the former. Our results open perspectives for the interpretation of the transport signatures of Weyl semimetals, especially close to the Curie temperature.

Abstract: Conventional theories for Mott insulators involve well-localized electronic orbitals. This picture fails in the presence of topological obstructions in Chern bands which prevent the formation of exponentially localized orbitals and are instead often viewed by analogy to Landau levels. Here, we show that strong interactions in fractionally-filled topological bands realize a class of Mott insulating states on emergent topological Kondo lattices. These can be naturally described by a partial Wannier basis of N-1 exponentially-localized orbitals for an N-band manifold with net non-zero Chern number. Choosing a gauge which breaks translation symmetry, we construct a supercell basis which segregates an isolated topological band into well-localized supercell Wannier orbitals that can host the local moments of a Mott insulating state, as well as an itinerant power-law-localized orbital that retains the topological obstruction. Together, they constitute a spontaneous Kondo lattice. We study fractionally-filled interacting quantum spin Hall bands in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model as well as twisted bilayers of MoTe2 at -1/3 filling. We demonstrate that strong short-ranged Coulomb interactions can stabilize a new class of topological Mott insulating states with broken translation symmetry and antiferromagnetic order, which compete with fractional Chern insulating states. Our results predict a new scenario for time-reversal-symmetric interacting topological bands in solids, beyond conventional Landau level paradigms for the fractional quantum Hall effect.

Abstract: We consider a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in the assisted hopping limit, where direct electron hopping is subdominant. At fixed electron-phonon coupling and in the absence of Coulomb interactions, the model shows a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid in the adiabatic limit and a quantum antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase at high phonon frequencies. Here, we show that by adding terms to the model that reinforce the AFM phase, thereby lowering the critical phonon frequency, the quantum phase transition becomes strongly first order. Our results do not depend on the symmetry of the model. In fact, adding a Hubbard-$U$ term to the model lowers the O(4) symmetry of the model to SU(2) such that the DQCP we observe has the same symmetries as other models that account for similar quantum phase transitions.

Abstract: Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the explorations of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX3 (X = S, Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting arises in the AA-stacking MnPX3/MPX3 (M = Cd, Mg, Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting emerges in the AB-stacking configurations. Combining MnPX3 and ferroelectric substrates like CuInP2S6 results in switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on band structures, which can be tuned by applying out-of-plane electric fields to non-volatilely reversing the ferroelectric polarization. In summary, our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional materials.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that a spin current can be induced by the acousto-electric evanescent wave, an electric field associated with surface acoustic waves (SAWs) that decay along the surface normal. A previous study showed that a magnetic-field-dependent dc voltage (acoustic voltage) emerges in heavy metal (HM)/ferromagnet (FM) bilayers under excitation of SAWs. The effect, referred to as the acoustic spin Hall effect, was understood by assuming a SAW-induced ac spin current rectified by the oscillation of the FM layer magnetization and the inverse spin Hall effect. However, the mechanism of the spin current generation remained unidentified. Here we measure the acoustic voltage as a function of the SAW propagation direction relative to the crystalline orientation of a LiNbO$_3$ substrate. We find that the magnetic field angle dependence of the acoustic voltage exhibits a phase shift depending on the SAW propagation direction. The result is consistently explained in terms of the acousto-electric evanescent wave generating the spin current in HM layer via the spin Hall effect, thus clarifies the origin of the acoustic spin Hall effect.

Abstract: The quest for room-temperature nanoscale magnets remains a central challenge, driven by their promising applications in quantum technologies. Layered $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal oxides with high magnetic ordering temperatures offer significant potential in this context. We explore ultrathin \ce{SrRu2O6} nanosheets using first-principles calculations, complemented by the classical Heisenberg Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, these nanosheets exhibit robust antiferromagnetic ordering with N\'eel temperatures exceeding 430 K, despite the enhanced spin fluctuations characteristic of two-dimensional systems. Surface-termination-induced intrinsic charge doping introduces complexity to the magnetism, resulting in an insulator-to-metal transition and renormalized N\'eel temperatures in doped systems. A detailed microscopic analysis reveals distinct mechanisms underlying the magnetic behavior in electron- and hole-doped nanosheets. These findings provide a foundation for advancing theoretical and experimental studies in the largely unexplored realm of correlated oxides at the two-dimensional limit.

Abstract: Few-unit cell thick Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) layers have recently attracted much interest due to their extreme anisotropy and two-dimensional superconductivity, although they are typically susceptible to ambient conditions. In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors.

# Influence of Magnetic Field and Temperature on Half Width at Half Maximum of Multi-photon Absorption Spectrum in Two-dimensional Graphene

## 磁场和温度对二维石墨烯多光子吸收谱半高半宽的影响

**Authors:** Cao Thi Vi Ba, Nguyen Quang Bau, Nguyen Dinh Nam, Anh-Tuan Tran, Nguyen Thu Huong

arXiv:2412.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Profile numerical method to calculate the spectral line width, or half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the absorption peaks of multi-photon absorption processes in a two-dimensional graphene system (2DGS) according to important external parameters such as magnetic field and temperature in the presence of strong electromagnetic waves (SEMW). The appearance of these absorption peaks is theoretically obtained from magneto-phonon resonance conditions within the framework of the quantum kinetic equation. The results take into account both scattering mechanisms: electron-optical phonon and electron-acoustic phonon. Under the influence of the magnetic field, according to the increasing photon energy of the SEMW, the graph showing the dependence of the multi-photon nonlinear absorption coefficient on photon energy has the form of absorption spectrum lines following magneto-phonon resonance conditions. When increasing the value of the external magnetic field and the intensity of the SEMW, the intensity of the resonance peaks increases. In addition, the HWHM W of the resonance peaks of multi-photon absorption processes increases with increasing magnetic field $\mathrm{B}$ according to the square root law $\mathrm{W} = \kappa\sqrt{\mathrm{B}}$ but is independent of temperature. The value of the HWHM of the one-photon absorption process is larger than the value of the HWHM of the multi-photon absorption processes. The calculations of the HWHM of the one-photon absorption process in this paper are consistent with previous experimental observations and theoretical calculations. Thus, our calculations of the HWHM of multi-photon absorption processes can serve as reliable predictions for future experiments.

# Quantum theory of the effect of increasing weak electromagnetic wave by a strong laser radiation in 2D Graphene

arXiv:2412.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic expressions for the absorption coefficient (AC) of a weak electromagnetic wave (EMW) in 2D Graphene under influence of strong laser radiation are calculated using the quantum kinetic equation (QKE) in the case of electron-optical phonon scattering in both the absence and presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene sheet. The dependence of the AC on the intensity $E_{02}$ and the frequency $\Omega_2$ of a weak EMW, on the intensity $E_{01}$ and the frequency $\Omega_1$ of a strong laser radiation, on the temperature T of the system is obtained. These results are investigated from low temperature to high temperature. These results are obtained from the QKE method, which broke the limit of the Boltzmann kinetic equations (only investigated in the high-temperature domain). Besides, the numerical results show that the AC of a weak EMW in 2D Graphene can have negative values. This demonstrates the possibility of increasing weak EMW by strong laser radiation in 2D Graphene. This is different from a similar problem in bulk semiconductors and the case without strong laser radiation. In the case of the presence of an external magnetic field, the numerical calculation results also show the appearance of the peak spectral lines that obey the magneto-phonon resonance conditions. The appearance of these resonance peaks provides a model illustrating the dependence of the Half-Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) on the external magnetic field. This is an important criterion for the fabrication of graphene-related electronic components and orientation for future experiments.

Abstract: Motivated by the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor, the pressurized $\rm{La}_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$, we present a renormalized mean-field theory of a bilayer single-band $t$-$J$ model, highlighting the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.

Abstract: Extensive studies on the impact of bismuth incorporation into the (Ga,Mn)As prototype dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor (DFS) on its structural, magnetic and magnetotransport properties are summarized in this review. Thin epitaxial layers of the quaternary (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) compound, containing up to 1% Bi and 6% Mn atoms, and the reference ternary (Ga,Mn)As compound, have been grown under either a compressive or tensile biaxial misfit strain by the low-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy technique with precisely optimized growth conditions. The high-resolution X-ray diffractometry measurements and transmission electron microscopy imaging of cross-sections across the sample interfaces have evidenced for high structural perfection of the DFS layers and sharp interfaces with the substrate. An addition of bismuth into the layers causes a small decrease in their ferromagnetic Curie temperature and a distinct increase in the coercive fields, as revealed by the superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry investigations. Most of all, the incorporation of a small atomic fraction of heavy Bi atoms, substituting As atoms in the layer, predominantly enhances the spin-orbit coupling strength in its valence band, considerably affecting electromagnetic properties of the layers. Investigations of magnetotransport properties of the DFS layers, performed on micro-Hall-bars prepared from the layers using electron-beam lithography patterning, reveal, as a result of Bi addition to the layers, significantly enhanced magnitudes of magnetoresistance, anomalous and planar Hall effects as well as the spin-orbit torque effect. The latter effect is of special interest for applications to the next generation non-volatile data storage and logic spintronic devices, utilizing electrically controlled magnetization reversal.

Abstract: Aligning with the everlasting search for quantum spin liquids (QSLs), identifying the QSL in Kitaev magnets has garnered great research interest during the past decade and remains nevertheless an enormous challenge. One of the major difficulties lies in that Kitaev QSL is typically fragile against competing interactions like off-diagonal exchanges, which are ubiquitous in real materials due to spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effect. This, in turn, gives rise to many intriguing field-induced novel phases and thermal Hall effect. In this review, we will focus on the interplay of Kitaev interaction and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ exchanges from a numerical perspective. This review discusses some representative exotic phases such as $\Gamma$ spin liquid, nematic ferromagnet, spin-flop phase, and distinct chiral-spin states with spontaneously time-reversal symmetry breaking. It also presents quantum phase diagrams of anisotropic Kitaev-$\Gamma$ chains that exhibit kaleidoscopes of both ordered and disordered phases.

Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the bilayer honeycomb lattice with large-scale tensor network calculations based on the infinite projected entangled pair state technique as well as high-order series expansions. We find that beyond various magnetically ordered phases, including ferromagnetic, zigzag, antiferromagnetic (AFM) and stripy states, two extended quantum spin liquid phases arise in the proximity of the Kitaev limit. While these ordered phases also appear in the monolayer Kitaev-Heisenberg model, our results further show that a valence bond solid state emerges in a relatively narrow range of parameter space between the AFM and stripy phases, which can be adiabatically connected to isolated Heisenberg dimers. Our results highlight the importance of considering interlayer interactions on the emergence of novel quantum phases in the bilayer Kitaev materials.

Abstract: Particles with high anisotropy in their magnetic properties and shape are of increasing interest for mechanobiology, where transducing a remotely applied magnetic field vector to a local mechanical response is crucial. An outstanding challenge is quantifying the mechanical torque of a single nanoparticle, typically in the range of atto- to femto-Newton-meters (Nm). The magneto-mechanical torque manifests due to a misalignment of the external magnetic field vector with the built-in magnetic anisotropy axis, as opposed to a magnetic force, and complicates the measurement scheme. In this work, we developed a method using a commercially available Atomic Force Microscopy setup and cantilevers to quantify the torque generated by a single synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) nanoplatelet with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Specifically, we measured 1.6$\pm$0.6$\cdot$10$^{-15}$ Nm torque while applying 373$\pm$5 mT field at 12$\pm$2 degrees to the built-in anisotropy axis exerted by a single circular SAF nanoplatelet with 1.88 $\mu$m diameter and 72 nm thickness, naively translating to a $\approx$ 1.7 nN maximum force at the nanoplatelet apex. This measured torque and derived force of the SAF nanoplatelets is strong enough for most applications in mechanobiology; for example, it can be used to rupture (cancer) cell membranes. Moreover, SAF nanoplatelets open a route for easy tuning of the built-in magnetic anisotropy and size, reducing the torque and allowing for small mechanical stimuli for ion channel activation. This work presents a straightforward and widely applicable method for characterizing magnetic particles' mechanical transduction, which is applied to SAF nanoplatelets with a high PMA.

arXiv:2412.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, spin orientation and variation of the strength of coupling in [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer have been investigated as a function of the thickness of the Fe layer. [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer has orthogonal anisotropy with the Fe layer, and [Co/Pt]ML has in-plane magnetic anisotropy and perpendicular anisotropy, respectively. Measurements are performed using in-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and isotope-sensitive depth-resolved nuclear resonance scattering (NRS) technique. Real-time in-situ MOKE measurement during Fe growth reveals that with an increase in thickness of the Fe layer, moments of Fe layer reorientation from out of the plane to in-plane direction. This is attributed to the decrease in the coupling between the [Co/Pt]ML and Fe layer. For the depth-dependent study, two [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayers having the same thickness but different positions of the Fe57 marker layer ([Co/Pt]MLFe/Fe57) and [Co/Pt]MLFe57/Fe ) were studied using the NRS technique. Films with varying external magnetic fields were also studied to investigate coupling strength. Measurements were performed under the x-ray standing wave conditions to enhance resonance yield. It is observed that for the 75 {\AA} Fe in [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer, the coupling varies along the depth of the Fe layer. The coupling is strong at [Co/Pt]ML and Fe interface with spins of the Fe layer aligned in the out-of-plane direction, whereas moments away from the interface are weakly coupled and aligned in-plane along the magnetic easy axis. Due to this gradient in strength of coupling along the depth, a large magnetic field is required to reorient spins at the interface along the magnetic hard axis of the Fe layer; however, spins away from the interface can rotate freely even in the low magnetic field.

Abstract: Frustrated magnetic systems with anisotropic exchange interactions have been recognized as key platforms for discovering exotic quantum states and quasiparticles. In this study, we report the pressure evolution of magnetic structures and quasiparticle excitations in the frustrated semiconductor YbCuS2, characterized by Yb3+ zigzag chains with competing exchange interactions. At ambient pressure, YbCuS2 exhibits a magnetic transition at TN ~ 0.95 K, forming an incommensurate helical magnetic order. Under hydrostatic pressure of 1.6 GPa, TN increases to 1.17 K, and the magnetic structure changes to a commensurate one, which can be regarded as an odd-parity magnetic multipole order. Remarkably, pressure suppresses the gapless quasiparticle excitations. These findings suggest that pressure alters the exchange interactions between the Yb ions, affecting both the magnetic ground state and the quasiparticle excitations. Our results highlight the pivotal role of anisotropic interactions in one-dimensionality to stabilize the complex quantum phases, offering insights into the interplay among frustration, dimensionality, multipoles and emergent quasiparticles.

Abstract: Providing radio frequency (RF) signals to circuits working in cryogenic conditions requires bulky and expensive transmission cabling interfacing specialized RF electronics anchored at room temperature. Superconducting Josephson junction arrays (JJAs) can change this paradigm by placing the RF source and detector inside the chip. In this work, we demonstrate that DC-biased JJAs can emit signals in the C-band frequency spectrum and beyond. We fabricate reproducible JJAs comprised of amorphous MoGe or NbTiN superconducting islands and metallic Au weak links. Temperature, magnetic fields, applied currents, and device design are explored to control the operation of the RF sources, while we also identify important features that affect the ideal source behavior. Combined with the proven ability of these JJAs to detect microwave radiation, these sources allow us to propose a fully DC-operated cryogenic on-chip measurement platform that is a viable alternative to the high-frequency circuitry currently required for several quantum applications.

Abstract: Magnetoresistance effect lays the foundation for spintronics, magnetic sensors and hard drives. The pursuit of magnetic materials with colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and/or angular magnetoresistance (AMR) has attracted enduring research interest and extensive investigations over past decades. Here we report on the discovery of field-induced record-breaking CMR of ~ -10^14 % and AMR ~ 10^14% achieved simultaneously in an antiferromagnetic rare-earth dichalcogenide EuSe2. Such intriguing observations are attributed to strong magnetic anisotropy and magnetic-field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition of the localized Eu2+ spins, which in turn closes the bandgap by lifting the degeneracy of Se-5p bands near Fermi level. Our DFT calculations perfectly replicate the experimental findings based on the Brillouin function and carries transport model. The present work provides a potential simple antiferromagnetic material for achieving angle-sensitive spintronic devices.

Abstract: The anisotropic quantum spin-1/2 XY model on a linear chain was solved by Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis in 1961 and shown to display a continuous quantum phase transition at the O(2) symmetric point separating two gapped phases with competing Ising long-range order. For the square lattice, the following is known. The two competing Ising ordered phases extend to finite temperatures, up to a boundary where a transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, and meet at the O(2) symmetric critical line along the temperature axis that ends at a tricritical point at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature where the two competing phases meet the paramagnetic phase. We show that the first-order zero-temperature (quantum) phase transition that separates the competing phases as a function of the anisotropy parameter is smoothed by thermal fluctuations into deconfined classical criticality.

Abstract: The exact recursion relations are used to study the mixed half-integer spin-(3/2, 7/2) Blume-Capel Ising ferrimagnetic system on the Bethe lattice. Ground-state phase diagrams are computed in the $({D_{A}}/{q|J|}, {D_{B}}/{q|J|})$ plane to reveal different possible ground states of the model. Using the thermal changes of the order-parameters, interesting temperature dependent phase diagrams are constructed in the ($D_{A}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$), ($D_{B}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) planes as well as in the ($D/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) plane where $D=D_A=D_B$. It is revealed that the system exhibits first- and second-order phase transitions and compensation temperatures for specific model parameter values. Under the constraint of an external magnetic field, the model also produces multi-hysteresis behaviors as single, double and triple hysteresis cycles. Particularly, the impacts of the ferrimagnetic coupling $J$ on the remanent magnetization and the coercitive fields for selected values of the other physical parameters of the system are pointed out. Our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with those reported in the literature.

Abstract: Water exhibits complex behaviors as a result of hydrogen bonding, and low-dimensional confined water plays a key role in material science, geology, and biology science. Conventional techniques like STM, TEM, and AFM enable atomic-scale observations but face limitations under ambient conditions and surface topographies. NV center magnetic resonance technology provides an opportunity to overcome these limitations, offering non-contact atomic-scale measurements with chemical resolution capability. In this study, a nanoscale layer dissection method was developed utilizing NV center technology to analyze water layers with diverse physicochemical properties. It unveiled the presence of a non-evaporating sub-nanometer water layer on a diamond surface under ambient conditions. This layer demonstrated impervious to atmospheric water vapor and exhibited unique electronic transport mediated via hydrogen bonding. These findings provide new perspectives and a platform for studying the structure and behavior of low-dimensional water, as well as the surface properties influenced by adsorbed water under native conditions.

Abstract: Magnetic vortices and skyrmions are typically characterized by distinct topological invariants. This work presents a unified approach for the topological classification of these textures, encompassing isolated objects and configurations where skyrmions and vortices coexist. Using homotopy group analysis, we derive topological invariants that form the free abelian group, $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. We provide an explicit method for calculating the corresponding integer indices in continuous and discrete systems. This unified classification framework extends beyond magnetism and is applicable to physical systems in general.

Abstract: Controlling the domain structure of ferroic materials is key to manipulating their functionality. Typically, quasi-static electric, magnetic, or strain fields are exploited to transform or pole ferroic domains. In contrast, metallurgy makes use of fast thermal quenches across phase transitions to create new functional states and domain structures. This approach employs the rapid temporal evolution of systems far from equilibrium to overcome the constraints imposed by comparably slow interactions. However, guiding the nonequilibrium evolution of domains towards otherwise inaccessible configurations remains largely unexplored in ferroics. Here, we harness thermal quenches to exert control over a ferroic domain pattern. Cooling at variable speed triggers transitions between two ferroic phases in a rare-earth orthoferrite, with transient domain evolution enabling the selection of the final domain pattern. Specifically, by tuning the quench rate, we can either generate the intrinsic domain structure of the low-temperature phase or transfer the original pattern of the high-temperature phase - creating a hidden metastable domain configuration inaccessible at thermal equilibrium. Real-time imaging during rapid quenching reveals two distinct time scales governing domain evolution: a fast fragmentation phase, followed by a slower relaxation towards a new pattern or back to the original one. This dynamic control of domain configurations, alongside external fields, strain engineering, and all-optical switching, offers a novel approach for actively manipulating ferroic order.

Abstract: The growing interest in 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials stems from their unique properties and potential applications in spintronics, magnonics and quantum information technologies. Among them, CrSBr is a semiconductor that stands out, owing to its high Curie temperature (TC ~ 146 K), air stability and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the effects of Dy doping (12.5%, 25%, and 50%) on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of CrSBr monolayer. Our results reveal that Dy incorporation enhances magnetic anisotropy, modulates TC, and can create quasi-1D ferromagnetic chains that arise from competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Additionally, we investigate the properties of DySBr, DySI and DySeI monolayers, which are isostructural to the CrSBr. Our results reveal the feasibility of exfoliating them down to the single-layer and the presence of long-range magnetic order at low temperatures, relying on the combination of both weak exchange interactions and large spin-orbit coupling. This work provides insights into tuning the properties of CrSBr through rare earth doping, unlocking new possibilities for advanced applications at the 2D limit.

# Refining the Two-Band Model for Highly Compensated Semimetals Using Thermoelectric Coefficients

Abstract: In studying compensated semimetals, the two-band model has proven extremely useful to capture electrical conductivities with intuitive parameters of densities and mobilities of electron-like and hole-like carriers, as well as to predict their magnetic field dependence. Yet, it rarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly compensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck ($S_{xx}$) and Nernst ($S_{xy}$) coefficients increase quadratically and linearly with field, respectively. Such field dependences were predicted by the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory and the Mott relation of the two-band system, and they are realized when two conditions are simultaneously met [1]: the multiple of cyclotron frequency ($\omega_c$) and relaxation time ($\tau$) is much larger than one, $\omega_c\tau \gg 1$ and the tangent of Hall angle ($\theta_H$) is much smaller than one, $\tan\theta_H \ll 1$. We use the relation between two carrier densities $n_e$ (electron-like) and $n_h$ (hole-like) derived from the field dependence of the TE coefficients, to refine the two-band model fittings. The compensation factor ($\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}$, where $\Delta n = n_e-n_h$) is found two orders of magnitude smaller than what was found in the unrestricted fitting and hence the larger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the framework of the semiclassical theory, we deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle $\tan\theta_{\gamma} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed $\big(\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}\times \omega_c\tau\big)^{-1}$. Our findings offer crucial insights not only for identifying the empirical conditions for the field-induced enhancement of the TE performance but also for engineering efficient thermoelectric devices based on semimetallic materials.

Abstract: Although the search for quantum many-body phenomena in magnetic materials has a strong focus on highly frustrated systems, even unfrustrated quantum magnets show a multitude of unconventional phenomena in their spin excitation spectra. YbBr$_3$ is an excellent realization of the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, and we have performed detailed spectroscopic experiments with both unpolarized and polarized neutrons at all applied magnetic fields up to saturation. We observe extensive excitation continua, which cause strong renormalization and the decay of single magnons at higher fields, while coherent features include field-induced ``shadows'' of the single magnons and the spectacular emergence of a roton-like excitation. To guide and interpret our experiments, we performed systematic calculations by the method of cylinder matrix-product states that provide quantitative agreement with the neutron scattering data and a qualitative benchmark for the spectral signatures of strong quantum fluctuations even in the absence of magnetic frustration.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the topological properties of the photon-dressed energy bands in bilayer $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices, focusing on both aligned and cyclic stacking configurations under the influence of off-resonant circularly polarized light. We derive precise analytical expressions for the quasi-energy bands in the aligned stacking case, while numerical results for cyclic stacking are obtained at the Dirac points. Our findings reveal that the time-reversal symmetry breaking caused by circularly polarized light completely lifts the degeneracy at the $t^{a,c}$-point intersections at these Dirac points. To investigate the topological signatures of the driven $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices, we examine the Berry phase through anomalous magnetic and thermal responses. Notably, at $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$, we find that the orbital magnetic moments associated with both corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, along with their Berry curvatures. For values of $0 < \alpha < 1$, off-resonant light induces deformations in the bands near the Dirac points, leading to two equally sized gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum. The position of the chemical potential within these gaps significantly influences the orbital magnetization. We observe that linear variations in magnetization correlate with Chern numbers on either side of $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$. These topological features manifest as distinct quantized values of anomalous Hall conductivity across both stacking types...

Abstract: In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual ``pseudogap'' metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of doping levels and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations. This behaviour is characterized by a doping-dependent energy scale that governs the exponential growth of the magnetic correlation length upon cooling. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this energy scale agrees well with the pseudogap temperature $T^{*}$. Our findings establish a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the magnetic origin and physical nature of the pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of pairing and collective phenomena among charge carriers expected to emerge at lower temperatures.

Abstract: Phase transitions are fundamental in nature. A small parameter change near a critical point leads to a qualitative change in system properties. Across a regular phase transition, the system remains in thermal equilibrium and, therefore, experiences a change of static properties, like the emergence of a magnetisation upon cooling a ferromagnet below the Curie temperature. When driving a system far from equilibrium, novel, otherwise inaccessible quantum states of matter may arise. Such states are typically non-Hermitian, that is, their dynamics break time-reversal symmetry, a basic law of equilibrium physics. Phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are of fundamentally new nature in that the dynamical behaviour rather than static properties may undergo a qualitative change at a critical, here called exceptional point. Here we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system. Optical excitation creates charge carriers in the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO. In a temperature-dependent interplay with the Hermitian transition to ferromagnetic order, a non-Hermitian change of the relaxation dynamics occurs, manifesting in our time-resolved reflection data as a transition from bi-exponential real to single-exponential complex decay. Our theory models this behavior and predicts non-Hermitian phase transitions for a large class of condensed-matter systems, where they may be exploited to sensitively control bulk-dynamic properties.

Abstract: The present study was conducted on dispersed YBa2Cu3O6+d (YBCO) during its hydration in gas-tight containers with K2CO3X1.5H2O crystal hydrate. The samples were exposed to an electromagnetic field with a frequency of 50 MHz or microwave radiation of 2 GHz. Changes in the weight of various bodies located in the immediate vicinity of containers with YBCO material were detected: when above the containers, the bodies lose weight, while the weight of bodies located under the containers, on the contrary, increases. The maximum weight defect recorded in experiments with a 5 g YBCO sample was about 1 mg. Discovered weight changes are very similar to the result obtained by E.E. Podkletnov et al. [Physica C: Superconductivity, 1992. V. 203. P. 441] - they observed a decrease in the weight of bodies placed above a rotating YBCO disk which was in a superconducting state and exposed to an alternating magnetic field. Podkletnov and other researchers put forward a hypothesis about screening of the gravitational field by the rotating YBCO-superconductor. Distinctive features of our experiments are the absence of the superconducting state in the YBCO material and its rotation. However, it is clear to us that we have observed the same phenomenon and, to our knowledge, this is probably the first time that Podkletnov effect has been confirmed in an independent study. Our interpretation of the effect differs from the initial one. According to our results, the YBCO material initiates a redistribution between bodies of a certain substance that affects their weight or mass.

Abstract: We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time correlations. Using single-spin-flip and global updates, we investigate the phase diagram at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency $\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson assisted, the model maps onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing $\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature signatures, a disordered pseudogap phase, of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.

Abstract: Understanding spin wave (SW) damping, and how to control it to the point of being able to amplify SW-mediated signals, is one of the key requirements to bring the envisaged magnonic technologies to fruition. Even widely used magnetic insulators with low magnetization damping in their bulk, such as yttrium iron garnet, exhibit 100-fold increase in SW damping due to inevitable contact with metallic layers in magnonic circuits, as observed in very recent experiments [I. Bertelli et al., Adv. Quantum Technol. 4, 2100094 (2021)] mapping SW damping in spatially-resolved fashion. Here, we provide microscopic and rigorous understanding of wavevector-dependent SW damping using extended Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with nonlocal damping tensor, instead of conventional local scalar Gilbert damping, as derived from Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium quantum field theory. In this picture, the origin of nonlocal magnetization damping and thereby induced wavevector-dependent SW damping is interaction of localized magnetic moments of magnetic insulator with conduction electrons from the examined three different types of metallic overlayers -- normal, heavy, and altermagnetic. Due to spin-split energy-momentum dispersion of conduction electrons in the latter two cases, the nonlocal damping is anisotropic in spin and space, and it can be dramatically reduced by changing the relative orientation of the two layers when compared to the usage of normal metal overlayer.

Abstract: We present an efficient method of calculating the vibrational spectrum of a magnetic molecule adsorbed on a superconductor, directly related to the first derivative of the tunneling $IV$ curve. The work is motivated by a recent scanning-tunneling spectroscopy of lead phthalocyanine on superconducting Pb(100), showing a wealth of vibrational excitations, the number of which highly exceeds molecular vibrations typically encountered on normal metals. We design a minimal model which represents the inelastic transitions by the spectral function of a frontier orbital of the molecule in isolation. The model allows for an exact solution; otherwise the full correlated superconducting problem would be hard to treat. The model parameters are supplied from an ab-initio calculation, where the presence of the surface on the deformation of molecular geometry can be taken into account. The spectral function of the highest-occupied molecular orbital of the anionic PbPc$^{1-}$ shows the best agreement with the experimental reference among other molecular charge states and orbitals. The method allows to include multiple vibrational transitions straightforwardly.

Abstract: An emerging concept for identification of different types of spin liquids is through the use of spontaneous spin noise. Here we develop spin noise spectroscopy for spin liquid studies by considering Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$, a material hypothesized to be either a quantum or a spiral spin liquid. By enhancing techniques introduced for magnetic monopole noise studies we measure the time and temperature dependence of spontaneous flux $\varPhi(t, T)$ and thus magnetization $M(t, T)$ of Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ samples. The resulting power spectral density of magnetization noise $S_M(\omega,T)$ reveals intense spin fluctuations with $S_M(\omega,T) \propto \omega^{-\alpha(T)}$ and 0.84 < $\alpha (T)$ < 1.04 . Both the variance $\sigma_M^2(T)$ and the correlation function $C_M(t,T)$ of this spin noise undergo crossovers at a temperature $T^* \approx$ 450 mK. While predictions for quantum spin liquids are inconsistent with this phenomenology, those from Monte-Carlo simulations of a 2D spiral spin liquid state in Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ yield overall quantitative correspondence with the measured frequency and temperature dependences of $S_M(\omega,T), C_M(t,T)$ and $\sigma _M^2(T)$, thus indicating that Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ is a spiral spin liquid.

Abstract: The spatial structure of in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states induced by a magnetic impurity in a superconductor is the essential ingredient for the possibility of engineering collective impurity states. Recently, a saddle-point approximation [Phys. Rev. B 105, 144503] revealed how the spatial form of a YSR state is controlled by an anisotropic exponential decay length, and an anisotropic prefactor, which depends on the Fermi velocity and Fermi-surface curvature. Here we analyze scanning tunnel microscope (STM) data on YSR states in NbSe$_2$, focusing on a key issue that the exponential decay length predicted theoretically from the small superconducting gap is much larger than the observed extent of YSR states. We confirm that the exponential decay can be neglected in the analysis of the anisotropy. Instead, we extract the anisotropic prefactor directly from the data, matching it to the theoretical prediction, and we establish that the theoretical expression for the prefactor alone captures the characteristic flower-like shape of the YSR state. Surprisingly, we find that up to linear order in the superconducting gap the anisotropic prefactor that determines the shape of YSR states is the same as the anisotropic response to the impurity in the underlying normal metal. Our work points out the correct way to analyze STM data on impurities in small-gap superconductors, and reveals the importance of the normal band structure's curvature and Fermi velocity in designing multi-impurity in-gap states in superconductors.

Abstract: Nonlinear photomagnetization is a process by which an oscillating electric field induces a static magnetization. We show that all 32 crystallographic point groups admit such spin polarization using circularly polarized electric fields to second order (as in the usual spin orientation or inverse Faraday effect) but only 29 points groups admit spin polarization using linearly polarized electric fields to second order. The excluded point groups are the highly symmetric $m$-3$m$, -$43m$ and 432. Using density functional theory we compute the spectrum of the second-order electric spin susceptibility of prototypical semiconductors Te, Se, SnS$_2$, GaAs, InSb and Si which corresponds to nonmagnetic materials with and without inversion symmetry. We show that nonlinear photomagnetization can be comparable to those of naturally occurring ferromagnets.

Abstract: The study of the gauge field is an everlasting topic in modern physics. Spin-orbit coupling is a powerful tool in ultracold atomic systems, resulting in an artificial gauge field that can be easily manipulated and observed in a tabletop environment. Combining optical Raman lattices and atom-atom interaction, the artificial gauge field can be made density-dependent. In this work, we propose a straightforward way to engineer one-dimensional density-dependent gauge field in a Bose-Hubbard model in spin-orbit coupled Raman lattices. Next, we study the model from two perspectives: few-body quantum walk dynamics and many-body ground state. In the first perspective, we show that large spin-flipped tunneling can lead to a deep two-body bound state. In the second perspective, mean-field and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations consistently reveal three different phases, i.e. the Mott insulator phase, the superfluid phase, and the magnetic superfluid phase. Finally, we discuss the experimental protocol with Raman lattices based on existing experimental platforms.

Abstract: We theoretically propose that van der Waals monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$ have four consecutive flat Chern bands in the 120$^\circ$ spiral antiferromagnetic ground state. The nontrivial topology of these Chern bands emerges from the synergy between Re $t_{2g}$ band folding with non-collinear spin configuration and spin-orbit coupling. By constructing maximally localized Wannier functions directly from first-principles calculations, the tight-binding model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands. Interestingly, many-body exact diagonalization and entanglement spectrum analysis suggest that correlated states such as fractional Chern insulator and charge density wave may appear in these Chern bands with $1/3$ filling. Furthermore, the spin configurations and band topology of Chern bands are tunable by external magnetic field. The general physics from the $d$ orbitals here applies to a large class of materials such as ReAg$_2$Br$_6$, ReAu$_2$I$_6$ and ReCu$_2X_6$ ($X$=Cl, Br, I). These notable predictions in pristine 2D materials, if realized experimentally, could offer a new playground for exploring correlated topological states at elevated temperature.

Abstract: We investigate some possible symmetries of the superconducting state that emerges in three-dimensional altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate within a weak-coupling approach that these altermagnets, which naturally possess an order modulated by a vector form factor $\boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$, favor spin-triplet superconductivity described by gap functions given by $\boldsymbol{d}(\mathbf{k}) = \boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) \times \boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) = - \boldsymbol{u}(-\mathbf{k})$. Consequently, this singles out $f$-wave spin-triplet superconductivity as the most favorable pairing state to appear in the vicinity of $d$-wave altermagnetism. Furthermore, we obtain that the combination of spin-singlet superconducting states with altermagnetism gives rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which are protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant. Using a Ginzburg-Landau analysis, we show that, for a class of spin-orbit coupled altermagnetic models, a superconducting phase is expected to appear at low temperatures as an intertwined $d + if$ state, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry spontaneously.

Abstract: The synergy between real and reciprocal space topology is anticipated to yield a diverse array of topological properties in quantum materials. We address this pursuit by achieving topologically safeguarded magnetic order in novel Weyl metallic Heusler alloy, Mn$_{2}$Pd$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn. The system possesses non-centrosymmetric D$_{2d}$ crystal symmetry with notable spin-orbit coupling effects. Our first principles calculations confirm the topological non-trivial nature of band structure, including 42 pairs of Weyl nodes at/near the Fermi level, offering deeper insights into the observed anomalous Hall effect mediated by intrinsic Berry curvature. A unique canted magnetic ordering facilitates such rich topological features, manifesting through an exceptionally large topological Hall effect at low fields. The latter is sustained even at room temperature and compared with other known topological magnetic materials. Detailed micromagnetic simulations demonstrate the possible existence of an antiskyrmion lattice. Our results underscore the $D_{2d}$ Heusler magnets as a possible platform to explore the intricate interplay of non-trivial topology across real and reciprocal spaces to leverage a plethora of emergent properties for spintronic applications.

Abstract: In the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in measuring quantum properties of light, such as quadratures of squeezed light and single-photon counting. Here, we explore whether such tools can be leveraged to probe electronic correlations in the many-body quantum regime. Specifically, we show that it is possible to probe certain spin, charge, and topological orders in an electronic system by measuring the correlation functions of scattered photons. We construct a mapping from the correlators of the scattered photons to those of a correlated insulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling. We show that frequency filtering before photodetection plays a crucial role in determining this mapping. We find that if the ground state of the insulator is a gapped spin liquid, a photon-pair correlation function, i.e., $G^{(2)}$, can detect the presence of anyonic excitations with fractional mutual statistics. Moreover, we show that correlations between electromagnetic quadratures can be used to detect expectation values of static spin chirality operators on both the kagome and triangular lattices, thus being useful in detecting chiral spin liquids. More generally, we show that a series of hitherto unmeasured spin-spin and spin-charge correlation functions of the material can be extracted from photonic correlations. This work opens up access to probe correlated materials, beyond the linear response paradigm, by detecting quantum properties of scattered light.

Abstract: Wave propagation in time-varying media has attracted significant attention for its innovative potential to control wave-matter interactions and to develop versatile active materials. While most research has focused on electromagnetic waves, studies on Dirac-type waves remain limited. In this work, we investigate temporal scattering in pseudospin-1/2 Dirac systems with random temporal mass variations. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact expressions for temporal reflectance in both short- and long-time regimes. In the long-time limit, reflectance probabilities become uniformly distributed, and wave group velocities decay to zero, indicating spatial localization. Numerical simulations reveal that narrow wave pulses evolve into Gaussian shapes, with their centers localizing and their widths growing indefinitely due to diffusive behavior. This universal phenomenon is independent of the initial pulse profile and the statistical properties of the random mass. Our findings demonstrate that random temporal variations can induce insulating behavior in Dirac materials, offering potential applications in solid-state physics and optics.

To calculate the magnetic properties of the disordered system, we employ the density of states method.

Abstract: Quasiequilibrium magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators have been a field of much interest, while condensation in antiferromagnetic systems has not yet been explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: a uniaxial easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction supports two degenerate condensate populations at finite wave vectors. We find that the condensation state in this model is stable only when the distribution of condensed magnons between the two populations is symmetric. In addition, we demonstrate the emergence of a zero-sound-like Goldstone mode in antiferromagnetic systems that support two-condensate magnon states. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict that the magnon condensate cannot stabilize due to the breaking of the magnon degeneracy. Our results suggest that this instability is a general characteristic of single-component quasiequilibrium quasiparticle condensates.

Abstract: Quantum sensors have notably advanced high-sensitivity magnetic field detection. Here, we report quantum sensors constructed from polarized spin-triplet electrons in photoexcited organic chromophores, specifically focusing on pentacene-doped para-terphenyl (${\approx}$0.1%). We demonstrate essential quantum sensing properties at room temperature: electronic optical polarization and state-dependent fluorescence contrast, by leveraging differential pumping and relaxation rates between triplet and ground states. We measure high optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast ${\approx}16.8\%$ of the triplet states at room temperature, along with long coherence times under spin echo and CPMG sequences, $T_2{=}2.7\mu$s and $T_2^{DD}{=}18.4\mu$s respectively, limited only by the triplet lifetimes. The material offers several advantages for quantum sensing, including the ability to grow large ($cm$-scale) crystals at low cost, the absence of paramagnetic impurities, and the diamagnetism of electronic states used for sensing when not optically illuminated. Utilizing pentacene as a representative of a broader class of spin triplet-polarizable organic molecules, this study highlights new potential for quantum sensing in chemical systems.

Abstract: Transporting and connecting quantum states are key capabilities for larger-scale quantum information processing. Concrete challenges are the coherent shuttling and the manipulation of distant quantum states in an optical lattice. Here, we create spin singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pair pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven spin singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.

Abstract: Optical metasurfaces have enabled high-speed, low-power image processing within a compact footprint. However, reconfigurable imaging in such flat devices remains a critical challenge for fully harnessing their potential in practical applications. Here, we propose and demonstrate phase-change metasurfaces capable of dynamically switching between edge detection and bright-field imaging in the visible spectrum. This reconfigurability is achieved through engineering angular dispersion at electric and magnetic Mie-type resonances. The customized metasurface exhibits an angle-dependent transmittance profile in the amorphous state of Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$ meta-atoms for efficient isotropic edge detection, and an angle-independent profile in the crystalline state for uniform bright-field imaging. The nanostructured Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$-based reconfigurable image processing metasurfaces hold significant potential for applications in computer vision for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry is a milestone experiment that transformed our understanding of the nature of light. The concept was demonstrated in 1956 to measure the radii of stars through photon coincidence detection. This form of coincidence detection later became a cornerstone of modern quantum optics. Here we connect HBT interferometry to the physics of scintillation, the process of spontaneous light emission upon excitation by high-energy particles, such as x-rays. Our work reveals intrinsic photon bunching in the scintillation process, which we utilize to elucidate its underlying light emission mechanisms. Specifically, g^((2) ) ({\tau}) enables the quantitative extraction of scintillation lifetime and light yield, showing their dependence on temperature and X-ray flux as well. This approach provides a characterization method that we benchmark on a wide gamut of scintillators, including rare-earth-doped garnets and perovskite nanocrystals. Our method is particularly important for nano- and micro-scale scintillators, whose properties are challenging to quantify by conventional means: We extract the scintillation properties in perovskite nanocrystals of only a few hundreds of nanometers, observing strong photon bunching (g^((2) ) (0)>50). Our research paves the way for broader use of photon-coincidence measurement and methods from quantum optics in studying materials with complex optical properties in extremes regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Abstract: Embedding normal susceptibilities in metasurfaces (MS), in tandem with their tangential counterparts, greatly enriches their spatial dispersion. Particularly, judicious siphoning of the microscopic nonlocality associated with such enhanced meta-atoms facilitates global control over the MS response across the entire angular range, specifically at challenging near-grazing scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous closed-form methodology to realize such intricate mixtures of tangential and normal components via a highly practical platform -- printed-circuit-board- (PCB) compatible cascaded admittance sheets. To this end, we derive a universal all-angular link between this MS-level composite, which leverages macroscopic nonlocality of multiple reflections, to its underlying meta-atom-level susceptibilities. We demonstrate this scheme by devising a PCB all-angle-transparent generalized Huygens' MS radome and an all-angle perfect-magnetic-conductor (PMC) PCB MS. Validated in simulation and experiment, our results pave the path toward a new insightful paradigm for studying and engineering nonlocal metadevices, e.g., optical analog computers and spaceplates.

Abstract: Searches for physics beyond the Standard Model using spin sensors are susceptible to spurious frequency shifts and noise due to magnetic fields. Therefore a comagnetometer -- an auxiliary sensor that allows mundane magnetic field effects to be differentiated from new physics -- is an essential feature of many precision searches. Here we demonstrate the operation of a novel type of comagnetometer using nuclear spins of dopant ions in a crystal, comparing four different sub-ensembles of ions. We demonstrate rejection of magnetic-field-induced shifts to better than 1 part in 10$^5$ using this system, laying the groundwork for improved searches of time-reversal symmetry violation using solid-state systems.

# Magnetic helicity fluxes in dynamos from rotating inhomogeneous turbulence

## 旋转不均匀湍流产生的发电机中的磁螺旋通量

**Authors:** Axel Brandenburg, Ethan T. Vishniac

arXiv:2412.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze direct numerical simulations of large-scale dynamos in inhomogeneous nonhelically-driven rotating turbulence with and without shear. The forcing is modulated so that the turbulent intensity peaks in the middle of the computational box and drops to nearly zero at the two ends above and below the midplane. A large-scale dynamo is driven by an $\alpha$ effect of opposite signs between the two hemispheres. In the presence of shear, the hemispheric magnetic helicity flux from small-scale fields becomes important and can even overcompensate for the magnetic helicity transferred by the $\alpha$ effect between large and small scales. This effect has not previously been observed in non-shearing simulations. Our numerical simulations show that the hemispheric magnetic helicity fluxes are nearly independent of the magnetic Reynolds number, but those between large and small scales, and the consequent dynamo effect, are still found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number -- just like in nonshearing dynamos. However, in contrast to nonshearing dynamos, where the generated mean magnetic field declines with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, it is now found to remain independent of it. This suggests that catastrophic dynamo quenching is alleviated by the shear-induced hemispheric small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes that can even overcompensate the fluxes between large and small scales and thereby cause resistive contributions.

Abstract: The work investigates enantiomers of chiral organo-metallic particles that exhibit a collective memory effect. Under the influence of magnetic field millions of particles in solution form macroscopic shapes and when dispersed again at zero field they return to their original shape. The charge and magnetic behaviors of the particles are strongly dependent on the handedness of the chiral molecule in the hybrid organometallic compound. The microparticles forming the shaped structures are collectively coupled under the influence of long-range van der Waals exchange interactions which govern the collective macroscopic structure. There is striking evidence that the nonlocal quantum exchange interactions between particles persist up to a distance of 10 meters at temperatures above 00C. The forces which govern the collective memory effect and shape the macroscopic structure therefore allow to visualize quantum phenomena which extend the classical causality notion into an expanded nonlocal reality in which the quantum fields of the particles exist simultaneously at separated points in space. We propose that the observations are attributed to chiral electronic states dependent van der Waals interactions coupled to vacuum fluctuations.

# A Fast Inverse Design Method for Multilayered, Multiport Pixelated Surfaces

## 多层多端口像素化表面的快速逆设计方法

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17617

**Authors:** Woojun Lee, Jungmin Lee, Jeffrey S. Walling

arXiv:2412.17617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast inverse design framework for complex multilayered, multiport pixelated surfaces - a class of structures largely unexplored in current research. Leveraging a method-of-moments (MoM) electromagnetic (EM) solver, the framework enables the rapid synthesis of pixelated device designs. A novel matrix reconstruction technique, based on pre-labeling matrix entries as "inter-pixel" or "inner-pixel," accelerates simulations for each variation of the pixelated structure. To mitigate the cubic increase in computation time associated with additional layers, GPU acceleration is employed. Further enhancing convergence speed, a stochastic multi-pixel flipping search algorithm is integrated into the framework. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the design of a diplexer achieving a -3-dB bandwidth for one channel spanning 5.23-5.94 GHz and another covering 6.17-7.15 GHz, validated by a full-wave solver.

Abstract: Space weather impact assessment is constrained by the lack of available asset information to undertake modeling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in Extra High Voltage electricity infrastructure networks. The U.S. National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central issue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC prediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical circuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data, which enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data. This process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to high-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by utilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component annotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage (>115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs utilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total of 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation voltage levels (>345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of 7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide new detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation configurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method and data with GIC assessment needs. The approach ensures consistency and rapid scalability, enabling users to quickly count components via a flexible web-browser application.

Abstract: We investigate energy release in the interacting magnetospheres of binary neutron stars (BNS) with global 3D force-free electrodynamics simulations. The system's behavior depends on the inclinations $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ of the stars' magnetic dipole moments relative to their orbital angular momentum. The simplest aligned configuration ($\chi_1=\chi_2=0^\circ$) has no magnetic field lines connecting the two stars. Remarkably, it still develops separatrix current sheets warping around each star and forms a dissipative region at the interface of the two magnetospheres. Dissipation at the interface is caused by a Kelvin-Helmholtz-type (KH) instability, which generates local Alfv\'enic turbulence and escaping fast magnetosonic waves. Binaries with inclined magnetospheres release energy in two ways: via KH instability at the interface and via magnetic reconnection flares in the twisted flux bundles connecting the two stars. The outgoing compressive waves can develop shocks and source fast radio bursts. We discuss implications for X-ray and radio precursors of BNS mergers.

Abstract: Optical dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) offers an attractive approach to enhancing the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Efficient, optically-generated electron polarization can be leveraged to operate across a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields, making it particularly appealing for applications requiring high DNP efficiency or spatial resolution. While a large class of systems hold promise for optical DNP, many candidates display both variable electron polarizability and electron and nuclear T1 relaxation times as functions of magnetic field and temperature. This necessitates tools capable of studying DNP under diverse experimental conditions. To address this, we introduce a cryogenic field cycling instrument that facilitates optical DNP studies across a wide range of magnetic fields (10mT to 9.4T) and temperatures (10K to 300K). Continuous cryogen replenishment enables sustained, long-term operation. Additionally, the system supports the ability to manipulate and probe hyperpolarized nuclear spins via pulse sequences involving millions of RF pulses. We describe innovations in the device design and demonstrate its operation on a model system of 13C nuclear spins in diamond polarized through optically pumped nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. We anticipate the use of the instrument for a broad range of optical DNP systems and studies.

Abstract: The origin of the magnetic quadrupole (MQ) interactions in Gd$_{3}$Ru$_{4}$Al$_{12}$ which is known as a frustrated spin system and as a host material of skyrmion with a sentrosymmetric crystal structure are discussed. The MQ interactions between ferromagnetic (FM) spin trimers with imperfect FM directivity are deduced from synthesis of dipole Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. The Hamiltonian which includes both the MQ interactions and dipole interactions is proposed, and magnetic anisotropies, magnetic phase transitions and contribution of the MQ interactions to stabilize the skyrmion lattice (SkL) are discussed based on this Hamiltonian. Degrees of MQ freedom carried by the trimers contribute to stabilizing SkL which appears at finite temperatures.

Abstract: Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the explorations of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX3 (X = S, Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting arises in the AA-stacking MnPX3/MPX3 (M = Cd, Mg, Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting emerges in the AB-stacking configurations. Combining MnPX3 and ferroelectric substrates like CuInP2S6 results in switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on band structures, which can be tuned by applying out-of-plane electric fields to non-volatilely reversing the ferroelectric polarization. In summary, our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional materials.

Abstract: Few-unit cell thick Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) layers have recently attracted much interest due to their extreme anisotropy and two-dimensional superconductivity, although they are typically susceptible to ambient conditions. In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors.

Abstract: Extensive studies on the impact of bismuth incorporation into the (Ga,Mn)As prototype dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor (DFS) on its structural, magnetic and magnetotransport properties are summarized in this review. Thin epitaxial layers of the quaternary (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) compound, containing up to 1% Bi and 6% Mn atoms, and the reference ternary (Ga,Mn)As compound, have been grown under either a compressive or tensile biaxial misfit strain by the low-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy technique with precisely optimized growth conditions. The high-resolution X-ray diffractometry measurements and transmission electron microscopy imaging of cross-sections across the sample interfaces have evidenced for high structural perfection of the DFS layers and sharp interfaces with the substrate. An addition of bismuth into the layers causes a small decrease in their ferromagnetic Curie temperature and a distinct increase in the coercive fields, as revealed by the superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry investigations. Most of all, the incorporation of a small atomic fraction of heavy Bi atoms, substituting As atoms in the layer, predominantly enhances the spin-orbit coupling strength in its valence band, considerably affecting electromagnetic properties of the layers. Investigations of magnetotransport properties of the DFS layers, performed on micro-Hall-bars prepared from the layers using electron-beam lithography patterning, reveal, as a result of Bi addition to the layers, significantly enhanced magnitudes of magnetoresistance, anomalous and planar Hall effects as well as the spin-orbit torque effect. The latter effect is of special interest for applications to the next generation non-volatile data storage and logic spintronic devices, utilizing electrically controlled magnetization reversal.

Abstract: Single-atom quantum sensors offer high spatial resolution and high sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields. Among them, trapped ions offer exceptional performance in sensing electric fields, which has been used in particular to probe these in the proximity of metallic surfaces. However, the flexibility of previous work was limited by the use of radio-frequency trapping fields, which has restricted spatial scanning to linear translations, and calls into question whether observed phenomena are connected to the presence of the radio-frequency fields. Here, using a Penning trap instead, we demonstrate a single ion probe which offers three-dimensional position scanning at distances between $50$ $\mu\mathrm{m}$ and $450$ $\mu\mathrm{m}$ from a metallic surface and above a $200\times200$ $\mu\mathrm{m}^{2}$ area, allowing us to reconstruct static and time-varying electric as well as magnetic fields. We use this to map charge distributions on the metallic surface and noise stemming from it. The methods demonstrated here allow similar probing to be carried out on samples with a variety of materials, surface constitutions and geometries, providing a new tool for surface science.

Abstract: This study shows the dynamics of relativistic electrons in terms of Dirac equation solutions when an ultra-intense short laser pulse of intensity $\ge 10^{23} {W.cm^{-2}}$ propagates through magnetized dense plasma ($B_0\approx {1MG})$. The interaction dynamics is analyzed near the strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED) regime. Our study finds new solutions in plasma media considering the effects of the re-normalized mass of relativistic electrons and the nonzero effective mass of accelerated photons. We have provided a general method for constructing exact solutions of the Dirac relativistic equation that correctly explains the dynamics of electrons in the strongly magnetized plasma medium. The modified solutions of the Dirac equation for one electron are derived and compared to the Volkov solutions. The new solutions are a basis for a feasible explanation of quantum attributes of relativistic electrons in a strong electromagnetic field of very short ultra-intense laser pulses with intensity near Schwinger field intensity. The solutions are called new Volkov solutions in a plasma medium. These solutions can be used to understand better the theory of quantum radiation reaction for the next-generation laser-plasma accelerator. Our results show that the Volkov solutions are not applicable in a magnetized plasma medium

Abstract: The multipole expansion can be formulated in spherical and Cartesian coordinates. By constructing an explicit map linking both formulations in isotropic media, we discover a lack of equivalence between them in anisotropic media. In isotropic media, the Cartesian multipole tensor can be reduced to a spherical tensor containing fewer entries. In anisotropic media, however, the loss of propagation symmetry prevents this reduction. Consequently, non-harmonic sources radiate fields that can be projected onto a finite set of Cartesian multipole moments but require potentially infinitely many spherical moments. For harmonic sources, the link between the two approaches provides a systematic way to construct the spherical multipole expansion from the Cartesian one. The lack of equivalence between both approaches results in physically significant effects wherever the field propagation includes the Laplace operator. We demonstrate this issue in an electromagnetic radiation inverse problem in anisotropic media, including an analysis of a large-anisotropy regime and an introduction to vector spherical harmonics. We show that the use of the Cartesian approach increases the efficiency and interpretability of the model. The proposed approach opens the door to wider applications of the multipole expansion and new degrees of freedom in anisotropic media.

Abstract: A front-end readout system with a large dynamic range is required for the high-granularity crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) at future Higgs factories. A new commercially available ASIC, MPT2321-B, which offers a significantly large dynamic range for the readout of the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), has been tested in the laboratory and at a test beam facility. The fundamental performance metrics have been characterised, including response linearity and single photon sensitivity. To quantitatively assess the dynamic range of the chip and evaluate its feasibility for SiPM readout in high-granularity crystal ECAL, a beamtest was conducted using scintillating crystals exposed to electron beams. Beamtest results showed that the chip exhibits a promising performance in terms of a good signal-to-noise ratio and a relatively large dynamic range.

Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re & p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is <10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with & without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes & orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.

Abstract: Quantum sensors have notably advanced high-sensitivity magnetic field detection. Here, we report quantum sensors constructed from polarized spin-triplet electrons in photoexcited organic chromophores, specifically focusing on pentacene-doped para-terphenyl (${\approx}$0.1%). We demonstrate essential quantum sensing properties at room temperature: electronic optical polarization and state-dependent fluorescence contrast, by leveraging differential pumping and relaxation rates between triplet and ground states. We measure high optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast ${\approx}16.8\%$ of the triplet states at room temperature, along with long coherence times under spin echo and CPMG sequences, $T_2{=}2.7\mu$s and $T_2^{DD}{=}18.4\mu$s respectively, limited only by the triplet lifetimes. The material offers several advantages for quantum sensing, including the ability to grow large ($cm$-scale) crystals at low cost, the absence of paramagnetic impurities, and the diamagnetism of electronic states used for sensing when not optically illuminated. Utilizing pentacene as a representative of a broader class of spin triplet-polarizable organic molecules, this study highlights new potential for quantum sensing in chemical systems.

Abstract: Transporting and connecting quantum states are key capabilities for larger-scale quantum information processing. Concrete challenges are the coherent shuttling and the manipulation of distant quantum states in an optical lattice. Here, we create spin singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pair pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven spin singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.

While most research has focused on electromagnetic waves, studies on Dirac-type waves remain limited. In this work, we investigate temporal scattering in pseudospin-1/2 Dirac systems with random temporal mass variations. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact expressions for temporal reflectance in both short- and long-time regimes. In the long-time limit, reflectance probabilities become uniformly distributed, and wave group velocities decay to zero, indicating spatial localization. Numerical simulations reveal that narrow wave pulses evolve into Gaussian shapes, with their centers localizing and their widths growing indefinitely due to diffusive behavior. This universal phenomenon is independent of the initial pulse profile and the statistical properties of the random mass. Our findings demonstrate that random temporal variations can induce insulating behavior in Dirac materials, offering potential applications in solid-state physics and optics.

Ionic transport within porous carbon electrodes is crucial for optimizing charge/discharge rates in supercapacitors, yet the material properties governing ion dynamics remain poorly understood. Contrary to the traditional viewpoint, we find that mesoporosity does not necessarily correlate with high supercapacitor rate capability. Instead, we employed pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance to directly measure anionic effective diffusivities in the carbon pores, offering a probe of ionic transport in supercapacitors. Our findings reveal a significant discrepancy between short-range and long-range diffusivities, which captures the tortuosity of the pore network. Short-range diffusivities lack correlation with supercapacitor rate capability, whereas long-range diffusivities correlate strongly. Ultimately, low-tortuosity nanoporous carbons exhibited superior rate capability, highlighting the importance of well-interconnected pore networks for efficient ion transport. Our study reveals pore network tortuosity as a key factor that governs charging rates in amorphous nanoporous carbons and guides the design of electrodes with optimized transport channels to enhance supercapacitor performance.

Phase transitions are fundamental in nature. A small parameter change near a critical point leads to a qualitative change in system properties. Across a regular phase transition, the system remains in thermal equilibrium and, therefore, experiences a change of static properties, like the emergence of a magnetisation upon cooling a ferromagnet below the Curie temperature. When driving a system far from equilibrium, novel, otherwise inaccessible quantum states of matter may arise. Such states are typically non-Hermitian, that is, their dynamics break time-reversal symmetry, a basic law of equilibrium physics. Phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are of fundamentally new nature in that the dynamical behaviour rather than static properties may undergo a qualitative change at a critical, here called exceptional point. Here we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system. Optical excitation creates charge carriers in the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO. In a temperature-dependent interplay with the Hermitian transition to ferromagnetic order, a non-Hermitian change of the relaxation dynamics occurs, manifesting in our time-resolved reflection data as a transition from bi-exponential real to single-exponential complex decay. Our theory models this behavior and predicts non-Hermitian phase transitions for a large class of condensed-matter systems, where they may be exploited to sensitively control bulk-dynamic properties.
