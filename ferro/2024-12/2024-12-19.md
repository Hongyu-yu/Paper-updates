# The fate of $p$-wave spin polarization in helimagnets with Rashba spin-orbit coupling

## 具有Rashba自旋轨道耦合的helimagnets中 $ p $ 波自旋极化的命运

**Authors:** Erik Wegner Hodt, Hendrik Bentmann, Jacob Linder

arXiv:2412.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been realized that magnetic systems with coplanar magnetic order that are invariant under the combined operation of time-reversal and translation with half a unit cell feature energy bands with a symmetry-protected $p$-wave spin polarization. Such $p$-wave magnets are a sought-after spin analogy of unconventional triplet superconducting pairing and show promise for use in spintronics. Metallic helimagnets provide a realization of $p$-wave magnetism, but such order often occurs in systems lacking inversion symmetry so that Rashba spin-orbit interactions can be prominent. An important question is therefore how the magnitude and the existence of $p$-wave spin polarization is affected by Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Here, we prove that while the $p$-wave symmetry of the spin-polarized bands is strictly speaking removed by spin-orbit interactions in helimagnets unless the period of the helix is fine-tuned, the actual quantitative deviation from $p$-wave symmetry is extremely weak unless the period of the helix is only a few lattice sites. Thereafter, we show that the $p$-wave magnetism becomes completely robust in pairs of antiferromagnetically coupled helices. More precisely, the $p$-wave spin-polarization of the bands then appears regardless of the periodicity and regardless of the strength of the spin-orbit interactions. This shows that antiferromagnetically coupled helimagnetic chains produce robust $p$-wave spin polarization free of fine-tuning requirements, making them attractive for potential spintronic applications.

Abstract: As a prototypical altermagnet, RuO$_{2}$ has been subject to many controversial reports regarding its magnetic ground state and the existence of crystal Hall effects. We obtained high-quality RuO$_{2}$ single crystal with a residual resistivity ratio (RRR = 152), and carefully measured its magnetization, longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) and Hall resistivity ($\rho_{yx}$) up to 35 T magnetic field. We also calculated its electronic band, Fermi surface, and conducted numerical simulations for its transport properties. It was found that no magnetic transition occurs below 400 K, and that all the transport properties are consistent with the numerical simulations results, indicating that the magnetotransport properties originate from the intrinsic electronic structures and are dominated by the Lorentz force. Particularly, no crystal Hall effects were observed in our RuO$_{2}$ samples and both magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity follow scaling behavior. These results demonstrate that RuO$_{2}$ is a typical semimetal, rather than an altermagnet.

arXiv:2412.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of altermagnet (AM) marks a significant advancement in magnetic materials, combining characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In this Letter, we focus on CrSb, which has been verified to be an AM and to exhibit substantial spin splitting near the Fermi level. After successfully growing high-quality CrSb single crystals, we performed comprehensive magnetization, magnetoresistance (MR), and Hall resistivity measurements, along with the electronic structure, and Fermi surface (FS) calculations, as well as the magneto-transport property numerical simulations. An antiferromagnetic transition occurring at $T_{N}$ = 712 K was reconfirmed. It was found that both experimental MR and Hall resistivity are consistent with the numerical simulation results, and exhibit obvious scaling behavior. The nonlinear Hall resistivity is due to its multi-band structure, rather than an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Especially, the scaling behavior in Hall resistivity is first observed within an AM material. These findings demonstrate that the magneto-transport properties in CrSb originate from the intrinsic electronic structure and are dominated by the Lorentz force.

# Emergence of quadrupolar order under magnetic field in $5d^2$ double perovskites

**Authors:** Stashu Kozlowski, Derek Churchill, Hae-Young Kee

arXiv:2412.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the time-reversal symmetry breaking signal in muon spin relaxation below a transition temperature without accompanying noticeable magnetic Bragg peaks in $5d^2$ Os double perovskites, a rare ferro-octupolar order was proposed to account for such hidden order. Here we study the phase transitions under a magnetic field in triangular and face-centered cubic lattices using classical Monte Carlo simulations. It is expected that higher-rank moments do not couple linearly to the magnetic field. Consequently, a field applied along the ferro-octupolar order is not anticipated to influence the ordering. However, we observe the emergence of antiferro-quadrupolar ordering mixed with the antiferro-octupolar order (AFQO) due to the field-induced bond-dependent exchange interaction. This field-linear interaction among non-Kramer doublets arises via the coupling to the excited triplet states enabled by the external field. In the triangular lattice, we uncover intriguing vortex states, which could inspire future research into $5d^2$ triangular lattice systems.

# Field-Resilient Supercurrent Diode in a Multiferroic Josephson Junction

Abstract: The research on supercurrent diodes has surged rapidly due to their potential applications in electronic circuits at cryogenic temperatures. To unlock this functionality, it is essential to find supercurrent diodes that can work consistently at zero magnetic field and under ubiquitous stray fields generated in electronic circuits. However, a supercurrent diode with robust field tolerance is currently lacking. Here, we demonstrate a field-resilient supercurrent diode by incorporating a multiferroic material into a Josephson junction. We first observed a pronounced supercurrent diode effect at zero magnetic field. More importantly, the supercurrent rectification persists over a wide and bipolar magnetic field range beyond industrial standards for field tolerance. By theoretically modeling a multiferroic Josephson junction, we unveil that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and multiferroicity underlies the unusual field resilience of the observed diode effect. This work introduces multiferroic Josephson junctions as a new field-resilient superconducting device for cryogenic electronics.

arXiv:2412.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The copper metaborate CuB2O4 (CBO) has been studied within the parametric space of magnetic field (B) and temperature (T), showing a series of distinct phases, including commensurate and incommensurate magnetic orders, as well as magnetic soliton phases. However, no single study has simultaneously demonstrated all these phases. This work presents the first comprehensive construction of the complex B vs T phase diagram for B = 0-9 T (B perpendicular to the c axis) and T = 0.1-25 K, utilizing thermodynamic probes, magnetic measurements, and neutron scattering on a single batch of CBO crystals. Our findings elucidate new magnetic phases and regimes. First-principles calculations help to gain a deeper and intricate understanding of this complex phase diagram. The emergence of various phases within such a narrow B and T regime is attributed to two primary mechanisms: the delicate competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, and the weak exchange and superexchange interactions within and between the Cu(A) and Cu(B) sublattices. This competition also leads to a magnetically frustrated ground state at absolute zero where the total magnetic entropy release from high to low temperatures is only 0.76Rln2, lower than Rln2 expected for copper spin 1/2. Taking CBO as an example, the present work elucidates the mechanisms underlying the formation of complex magnetic phases.

# Dynamical Aharonov-Bohm cages and tight meson confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-loop gauge theory

**Authors:** Enrico C. Domanti, Alejandro Bermudez, Luigi Amico

arXiv:2412.12425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite-density phases of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) of interconnected loops and dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges. The gauge-invariant Wilson terms, accounting for the magnetic flux threading each loop, correspond to simple two-body Ising interactions in this setting. Such terms control the interference of charges tunneling around the loops, leading to dynamical Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cages that are delimited by loops threaded by a $\pi$-flux. The latter can be understood as $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortices, the analog of visons in two dimensional LGTs, which become mobile by adding quantum fluctuations through an external electric field. In contrast to a semi-classical regime of static and homogeneous AB cages, the mobile visons can self-assemble leading to AB cages of different lengths depending on the density of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges and the interplay of magnetic and electric terms. Inside these cages, the individual charges get confined into tightly-bound charge-neutral pairs, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ analogue of mesons. Depending on the region of parameter space, these tightly-bound mesons can propagate within dilute AB-dimers that virtually expand and contract, or else move by virtually stretching and compressing an electric field string. Both limits lead to a Luttinger liquid described by a constrained integrable model. This phase is separated from an incompressible Mott insulator where mesons belong to closely-packed AB-trimers. In light of recent trapped-ion experiments for a single $\mathbb{Z}_2$ loop, these phases could be explored in future experiments.

Abstract: Exploring novel systems with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is vital for advancing memory devices. In this study, we report an intriguing PMA system involving an ultrathin Fe layer on an antiferromagnetic (AFM) CoO(001) surface. The measured perpendicular anisotropy field is inversely proportional to the Fe thickness, indicating an interfacial origin of PMA. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the antiferromagnetism of CoO has a negligible effect on the PMA. By leveraging the magneto-optical Kerr effect and birefringence effect, we achieved concurrent visualization of ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM domains. A pronounced coupling effect between these domains was observed near the spin reorientation transition, contrasting sharply with areas of stronger PMA that exhibited weak coupling. This research not only establishes a new FM/AFM bilayer PMA system but also significantly advances the understanding of FM/AFM interfacial interactions.

**Authors:** Xiaohu Han, Pedro Ribeiro, Stefano Chesi

arXiv:2412.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the fate of spiral order in a one-dimensional system of localized magnetic moments coupled to itinerant electrons under a voltage bias. Within an adiabatic approximation for the dynamics of the localized spins, and in the presence of a phenomenological damping term, we demonstrate the occurrence of various dynamical regimes: At small bias a rigidly rotating non-coplanar magnetic structure is realized which, by increasing the applied voltage, transitions to a quasi-periodic and, finally, fully chaotic evolution. These phases can be identified by transport measurements. In particular, the rigidly rotating state results in an average transfer of spin polarization. We analyze in detail the dependence of the rotation axis and frequency on system's parameters and show that the spin dynamics slows down in the thermodynamic limit, when a static conical state persists to arbitrarily long times. Our results suggest the possibility of discovering non-trivial dynamics in other symmetry-broken quantum states under bias.

Abstract: Since the discovery of ultrafast demagnetization in Ni thin films in 1996, laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics have become a prominent research topic in the field of magnetism and spintronics. This development offers new possibilities for the advancement of spintronics and magnetic storage technology. The subject has drawn a substantial number of researchers, leading to a series of research endeavors. Various models have been proposed to elucidate the physical processes underlying laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics in ferromagnetic materials. However, the potential origins of these processes across different material systems and the true contributions of these different origins remain challenging in the realm of ultrafast spin dynamics. This predicament also hinders the development of spintronic terahertz emitters. In this review, we initially introduce the different experimental methods used in laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics. We then systematically explore the magnetization precession process and present seven models of ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic materials. Subsequently, we discuss the physical processes and research status of four ultrafast demagnetization origins (including spin-flipping, spin transport, non-thermal electronic distribution, and laser-induced lattice strain). Since attosecond laser technique and antiferromagnetic materials exhibit promising applications in ultrahigh-frequency spintronics, we acknowledge the emerging studies used by attosecond pules and studies on ultrafast spin dynamics in antiferromagnets, noting the significant challenges that need to be addressed in these burgeoning field.

Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can increase nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals by orders of magnitude. DNP in diamond proceeds through different DNP mechanisms with a possible temperature-dependence. We report on 13C dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments in diamonds at 3.4 T and 7 T between 300 K and 1.7 K. Nuclear polarization enhancements between 100 and 600 were measured for all temperatures, corresponding to polarizations at 7 T between 0.1% (300 K) and 38% (1.7 K). A strong temperature dependence of the DNP profiles was observed. Longitudinal-detected (LOD) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments revealed an additional broad temperature-dependent electron line centered around the mI = 0 line of the P1 triplet transitions. Our results suggest that nuclei are preferentially polarized via a direct hyperfine mediated polarization transfer while spin diffusion in the sample plays a minor role.

Abstract: Upon a polarization reversal within a ferroelectric material, one stable state changes into another which is typically described by a progression of switching events of smaller fractions of the material. These events give rise to crackling or Barkhausen noise and follow a characteristic distribution in their sizes. Barkhausen noise has been studied to better understand the switching processes of ferroelectrics and has been applied for inorganic ferroelectric materials and perovskites. In this work, we present results from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations investigating the switching process of the small organic molecular ferroelectric benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTAs). For temperatures below 175 K and sufficiently strong structural disorder, the system exhibits self-organized critical behavior; for higher temperatures, a creep regime is entered. Our extracted power-law exponents are smaller than those typically measured in inorganic crystals and ceramics which indicates that in the more disordered material BTA larger spanning avalanches are possible. The system was experimentally investigated with a high-sensitivity setup. No Barkhausen noise was observed which is consistent with the simulated event sizes, lying several orders beneath the noise threshold of the experimental setup. This finding corroborates the notion that switching in BTA progresses along the 1D columns in the hexagonal liquid crystal lattice, with little coupling between the columns that could give rise to larger lateral avalanches.

Abstract: Polarization reversal within a ferroelectric material is commonly described as a progression of smaller switching events, giving rise to crackling or Barkhausen noise. While studies on Barkhausen noise, and particularly the associated event size distribution, allow for better understanding of switching processes in ferroelectrics, they were not yet conducted experimentally on organic ferroelectric materials. In this work, Barkhausen noise in the organic ferroelectric copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF:TrFE)) is experimentally investigated under different electric fields, increasing at various rates. A weak dependence of the structure of the Barkhausen noise on both the magnitude and rise time of the applied electric field is observed, which manifests as a trend in the probability density function power-law exponents. Specifically, an increase in maximum electric field leads to an increase of the power-law exponent; increasing the rise time causes a parallel shift towards lower exponents. While these findings do not allow to conclusively confirm or refute universal self-organized critical behavior of the polarization reversal avalanches in P(VDF:TrFE), the exponents were found to seemingly converge to the universal value of 1.5 for fast and strong driving, suggesting the system is close to this limit.

Abstract: The ability to control magnetism with strain offers innovative pathways for the modulation of magnetic domain configurations and for the manipulation of magnetic states in materials on the nanoscale. Although the effect of strain on magnetic domains has been recognized since the early work of C. Kittel, detailed local observations have been elusive. Here, we use mechanical strain to achieve reversible control of magnetic textures in a kagome-type Fe3Sn2 ferromagnet without the use of an external electric current or magnetic field in situ in a transmission electron microscope at room temperature. We use Fresnel defocus imaging, off-axis electron holography and micromagnetic simulations to show that tensile strain modifies the structures of dipolar skyrmions and switches their magnetization between out-of-plane and in-plane configurations. We also present quantitative measurements of magnetic domain wall structures and their transformations as a function of strain. Our results demonstrate the fundamental importance of anisotropy effects and their interplay with magnetoelastic and magnetocrystalline energies, providing new opportunities for the development of strain-controlled devices for spintronic applications.

Abstract: When two BN layers are stacked in parallel in an AB or BA arrangement, a spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization arises due to charge transfer in the out-of-plane B-N bonds. The ferroelectric switching from AB to BA (or BA to AB) can be achieved with a relatively small out-of-plane electric field through the in-plane sliding of one atomic layer over the other. However, the optical detection of such ferroelectric switching in hBN has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we utilize an adjacent WSe2 monolayer to detect the ferroelectric switching in BN. This dynamic coupling between a 2D ferroelectric and a 2D semiconductor allows for the fundamental investigation of the ferroelectric material using a non-destructive, local optical probe, offering promising applications for compact and non-volatile memory devices.

Abstract: Transition-metal ions with $5d^2$ electronic configuration in a cubic crystal field are prone to have a vanishing dipolar magnetic moment but finite higher-order multipolar moments, and they are expected to exhibit exotic physical properties. Through an investigation using resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy (RIXS), Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical ligand-field multiplet and $ab initio$ calculations, we fully characterized the electronic structure of Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$, particularly, the crystal-field symmetry of the 5$d^2$ electrons in this anomalous material. The low-energy multiplet excitations from RIXS at the oxygen $K$ edge and Raman-active phonons both show no splitting, confirming the absence of Jahn-Teller distortion. These findings are consistent with the ground state with the 'hidden order' of magnetic octupoles. Obtained parameters pave the way for further realistic microscopic studies of this highly unusual class of materials, advancing our understanding of spin-orbit physics in systems with higher-order multipoles.

Abstract: We report an infrared spectroscopy study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator EuZn$_2$As$_2$ over a broad frequency range, spanning temperatures both above and below the AFM transition $T_{\rm N} \simeq$ 20 K. The optical response reveals an insulating behavior, featuring two prominent infrared-active phonon modes at around 95 and 190 cm$^{-1}$, and two subtle absorption peaks at around 130 ($\alpha$ peak) and 2700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\beta$ peak), along with a strong absorption edge rising around 9000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\gamma$ peak). Significantly, the temperature-dependent changes in these peaks show noticeable anomalies across the AFM transition, particularly the emergence of the $\alpha$ peak and an unusual redshift of the $\gamma$ peak, suggesting a strong interaction between the charge excitations and the AFM order. Band structure calculations reveal that these anomalies arise from magnetization-induced band renormalizations, including shifts and foldings. Additionally, both phonon modes feature asymmetric Fano line shapes at low temperatures, with the 95 cm$^{-1}$ phonon mode exhibiting strong coupling to the fluctuations of Eu spins. These findings highlight a complex interplay of spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in EuZn$_2$As$_2$.

Abstract: The ghost-Gutzwiller variational wavefunction within the Gutzwiller approximation is shown to stabilize a genuine paramagnetic Mott insulator in the half-filled single-band Hubbard model. This phase hosts quasiparticles that are crucial to the paramagnetic response without showing up in the single-particle spectrum, and, as such, they can be legitimately regarded as an example of Anderson's spinons. We demonstrate that these spinons at the interface with a metal reacquire charge by proximity effect and thus reemerge in the spectrum as a heavy-fermion band.

Abstract: The European project SCARLET aims to study and realize a demonstrator of a MVDC (Medium Voltage Direct Current) high-power superconducting cable. This device might be employed to connect offshore wind farms with land, expecting to significantly simplify the offshore platform by eliminating the need for its conversion function. For this purpose, windmill conversion chain must be modified to directly produce the MVDC export voltage. In this scenario, this paper presents the case of a 1GW offshore windmill superconducting link and outlines the design consideration for a 1 GW onshore converter. For this cable, a protection strategy that combines DC circuit breakers with a Resistive Superconducting Fault Current Limiter is proposed. Moreover, this works demonstrates how a superconducting cable can be modelled as an electrical circuit to be integrated into a network simulation tool, enabling the investigation of various fault scenarios and protection strategies. Finally, a specific result is discussed to exemplify how the proposed approach can benefit the design of both the electrical network and the superconducting cable itself.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the N\'eel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the N\'eel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.

Abstract: First-principles calculations are employed to study the ferroelectric properties and the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) of antimony sulfur iodide (SbSI). The BPVE enables direct sunlight-to-electricity conversion in homogeneous materials and, in ferroelectric compounds, can be tuned via an electric field controlling the polarization. However, most ferroelectrics are oxides with large band gaps exceeding visible light energy, limiting their photovoltaic performance. Featuring a visible-range band gap, SbSI instead combines remarkable photovoltaic capabilities with a spin-textured band structure, coupling charge and spin degrees of freedom. The calculations predict ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases with comparable band gaps but distinct Rashba-Dresselhaus and Weyl-like spin textures relevant for spintronics. The BPVE is driven by the linear and circular photogalvanic effects, exhibiting large photoconductivities under visible light. Furthermore, it can serve to identify the phase of the material, with the circular photogalvanic effect which also reflects spin-texture changes. With its multifunctional properties, SbSI emerges as a promising material candidate for efficient solar energy conversion and advanced electronics, with potential applications extending to spintronics.

Abstract: In this paper we theoretically describe a distinct class of two-dimensional N\'{e}el ordered metallic antiferromagnets on a honeycomb-like lattice in which the two sublattices are connected only by a combination of time-reversal and mirror symmetry operations. As a result of this symmetry, conducting fermions have antiferromagnetic spin-splitting consistent with the symmetry, the mirror-symmetric spin-splitting. It is shown that the anomalous spin Hall effect is expected in such systems. We also consider a system in which there are no symmetries between the sublattices and obtain asymmetric spin-splitting. Such systems are expected to have the anomalous Hall effect. Our theoretical models suggest that conducting fermions in the MnTe antiferromagnet may be described by either of the obtained spin-splittings, which appear almost as the $d-$wave symmetric and which has been recently observed in experiments.

arXiv:2412.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many systems are topologically trivial in the bulk, but still have non-trivial wavefunctions locally in the Brillouin zone. For example, in a small-gap Dirac material the Berry curvature is strongly peaked, but cancels over the full Brillouin zone, while in semimetals and in nodal superconductors there may be a lower-dimensional winding topology associated to the nodes. Experimentally, it is difficult to directly observe such topology. We consider general bulk Hamiltonians with nodes and chiral symmetry, extending to them the method developed in Dutreix et al. [Nature, 574(7777):219-222 (2019)], which in particular detected the winding around Dirac cones in graphene using charge modulations around an impurity. We apply our method to nodal superconductors in 2d, in presence of a (non)magnetic impurity, measured by standard or spin-polarized STM tip. We derive general conditions on the impurity scattering and on the STM tip, expressed in terms of their preference among the two chiralities, for when the measurement near the impurity captures the winding difference between any chosen pair of (Bogoliubon) Dirac cones. We emphasize the robustness of observing vortices in momentum space, in contrast to dislocations in real space, in STM data. Testing the conditions on the topological nodal superconductor proposed for monolayer NbSe2 under an in-plane magnetic field, we find that spin-polarized STM on a magnetic impurity can detect the winding of each of the 12 nodes. We conclude that a judicious choice of impurity can be a powerful tool to determine topological quantities in 2d superconducting systems as well as any nodal chiral system.

Abstract: Hole spins in silicon or germanium quantum dots have emerged as a compelling solid-state platform for scalable quantum processors. Besides relying on well-established manufacturing technologies, hole-spin qubits feature fast, electric-field-mediated control stemming from their intrinsically large spin-orbit coupling [1, 2]. This key feature is accompanied by an undesirable susceptibility to charge noise, which usually limits qubit coherence. Here, by varying the magnetic-field orientation, we experimentally establish the existence of ``sweetlines'' in the polar-azimuthal manifold where the qubit is insensitive to charge noise. In agreement with recent predictions [3], we find that the observed sweetlines host the points of maximal driving efficiency, where we achieve fast Rabi oscillations with quality factors as high as 1200. Furthermore, we demonstrate that moderate adjustments in gate voltages can significantly shift the sweetlines. This tunability allows multiple qubits to be simultaneously made insensitive to electrical noise, paving the way for scalable qubit architectures that fully leverage all-electrical spin control. The conclusions of this experimental study, performed on a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor device, are expected to apply to other implementations of hole spin qubits.

Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism within a single material system represents a long-standing goal in condensed matter physics. Van der Waals-based moir\'e superlattices provide an exceptional platform for exploring competing and coexisting broken symmetry states. Alternating twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) exhibits robust superconductivity at the magic angle of 1.57{\deg} and 1.3{\deg}, with suppression at intermediate twist angles. In this study, we investigate the intermediate regime and uncover evidence of orbital magnetism. As previously reported, superconductivity is suppressed near the charge neutrality point (CNP) and emerges at larger moir\'e fillings. Conversely, we find orbital magnetism most substantial near the CNP, diminishing as superconductivity develops. This complementary behavior is similarly observed in the displacement field phase space, highlighting a competitive interplay between the two phases. Utilizing gate-defined Josephson junctions, we probe orbital magnetism by electrostatically tuning the weak links into the magnetic phase, revealing an asymmetric Fraunhofer interference pattern. The estimated orbital ferromagnetic ordering temperature is approximately half the superconducting critical temperature, coinciding with the onset of Fraunhofer asymmetry. Our findings suggest that the observed orbital magnetism is driven by valley polarization and is distinct from the anomalous Hall effect reported at integer fillings in twisted graphene systems. These results offer insights into the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in moir\'e superlattices.

arXiv:2412.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to compute exact $g$-function for integrable quantum field theories with non-diagonal scattering S-matrices. The approach is based on an integrable lattice regularization of the quantum field theory. The exact $g$-function is encoded in the overlap of the integrable boundary state and the ground state on the lattice, which can be computed exactly by Bethe ansatz. In the continuum limit, after subtracting the contribution proportional to the volume of the closed channel, we obtain the exact $g$-function, given in terms of the counting function which is the solution of a nonlinear integral equation. The resulting $g$-function contains two parts, the scalar part, which depends on the boundary parameters and the ratio of Fredholm determinants, which is universal. This approach bypasses the difficulties of dealing with magnetic excitations for non-diagonal scattering theories in the framework of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. We obtain numerical and analytical results of the exact $g$-function for the prototypical sine-Gordon theory with various integrable boundary conditions.

Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.

Abstract: This work investigates how the closed channel of a Feshbach resonance is characterised by experimental observables. Surprisingly, it is found that the two-body observables associated with the Feshbach resonance can be insensitive to the properties of the closed channel. In particular, it is impossible in this situation to determine the energy of the bound state causing the resonance from the usual experimental data. This is the case for all magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atoms, due to their deep two-body interaction potentials. This insensitivity highlights a major difference with Feshbach resonances that involve shallow interaction potentials, such as hadron resonances. It appears however that short-range two-body correlations and three-body observables are affected by a parameter of the closed channel called the "closed-channel scattering length". A photoassociation experiment is proposed to measure this parameter in ultracold atom systems.

Abstract: We examine the hydrostatic stress of electrons strongly confined in a quasi-2D quantum well in the presence of a strong perpendicular and weak in-plane magnetic field. This introduces anisotropy into the stress tensor which is inconsistent with the notion of the quantum Hall droplet as a simple two-dimensional electron fluid. We show that the breaking of rotational symmetry is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an anisotropic ground state stress tensor, and that the anisotropic stress originates primarily from quantum effects. We demonstrate this by decomposing the semiclassical trajectories of electrons in the system onto planes in phase space which must be rotated relative to the plane of the fluid to decouple the Hamiltonian.

Abstract: Quantum information transport over micron to millimeter scale distances is critical for the operation of practical quantum processors based on spin qubits. One method of achieving a long-range interaction is by coherent electron spin shuttling through an array of silicon quantum dots. In order to execute many shuttling operations with high fidelity, it is essential to understand the dynamics of qubit dephasing and relaxation during the shuttling process in order to mitigate them. However, errors arising after many repeated shuttles are not yet well documented. Here, we probe decay dynamics contributing to dephasing and relaxation of a singlet-triplet qubit during coherent spin shuttling over many $N$ repeated shuttle operations. We find that losses are dominated by magnetic dephasing for small $N<10^3$ and by incoherent shuttle errors for large $N>10^3$. Additionally, we estimate shuttle error rates below $1\times10^{-4}$ out to at least $N=10^3$, representing an encouraging figure for future implementations of spin shuttling to entangle distant qubits.

Abstract: The discovery of Mott insulators and superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene has ignited intensive research into strong correlation effects in other stacking geometries. Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), when subjected to a perpendicular electric field, exhibits phase transitions to a variety of broken-symmetry states. Notably, superconductivity emerges when BBG is in proximity to a heavy transition-metal dichalcogenide, highlighting the role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we investigate the origin of Ising SOC and its role in the competition between superconductivity and spin- and valley-polarized states in BBG. Starting from strong electron-electron interactions on the BBG lattice, we derive a low-energy effective model near the valleys that incorporates both density-density and spin-spin interactions. Using self-consistent mean-field theory, we map out the BBG phase diagram. Our findings reveal that near the van Hove filling, a mixed spin- and valley-polarized phase dominates over superconductivity. Away from the van Hove filling, a spin-polarized, spin-triplet superconducting state arises, characterized by an in-plane orientation of the magnetic moment and an out-of-plane orientation of the d-vector. Contrary to previous proposals, we find that Ising SOC favours spin-valley order while suppressing superconductivity near the van Hove singularity. We discuss other potential proximity effects and suggest directions for future studies.

Abstract: For the discrete-time or the continuous-time Markov spin models for image generation when each pixel $n=1,..,N$ can take only two values $S_n=\pm 1$, the finite-time forward propagator depends on the initial and on the final configurations of the $N$ spins only via a single global variable, namely the extensive overlap that counts the number of spins that have the same value or not in the two configurations. The joint probability distribution of the overlap and of the magnetization during the forward noising dynamics can be written for any finite number $N$ of pixels and in the limit $N \to + \infty$ to extract the large deviations properties. The consequences for the backward reconstructive dynamics are then analyzed for various initial conditions, namely (i) a single image (ii) a mixture of two images (iii) when the initial condition corresponds to the Curie-Weiss mean-field ferromagnetic model in the microcanonical ensemble, as a simple analog of the manifold-hypothesis concerning continuous generative diffusion models.

Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength "squeezing", and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton-polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses that would enable their observation in cryo-SNOM experiments. Furthermore, by electrically tuning the excitons energy into the Reststrahlen band of the surrounding hexagonal-boron-nitride, we demonstrate that strong coupling between the excitons and hyperbolic phonon polaritons can be achieved, and well-described by an electromagnetic transmission line model. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable plasmonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.

Abstract: We consider a coupling element based on a symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and show that it mediates a two-photon interaction. This and other inductive interactions due to the SQUID can be switched off in situ. We derive the system Hamiltonian for coupled resonator and rf SQUID. The rf SQUID dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of energy states and acts as an artificial atom. We discuss how the Josephson symmetry breaks owing to magnetic fields in the superconducting loops. We assess that the two-photon coupling strength reaches 18 MHz which can exceed the single-photon capacitive interaction in the coupler.

Abstract: Many processes in microfluidics and biology are driven or affected by viscosity. While several methods are able to measure this parameter globally, very few can provide high resolution viscosity images. Optimizing the locality of viscosity measurements demands smaller probes but also shorter lateral diffusion lengths and measurement times. Here, we propose to use sub-micrometer magnetic rods to perform high resolution viscosity imaging. An external magnetic field forces the oscillation of superparamagnetic iron oxide rods. Under linearly polarized illumination, the rotation of these highly anisotropic optical scatterers induces a blinking which is analyzed by heterodyne holography. The spectral analysis of the rotation dynamics yields a regime transition frequency from which the local viscosity is deduced. Holography provides a 3D optical field reconstruction and 3D superlocalization of the rods, which allows super-resolved viscosity measurements. Relying on the fast Brownian rotation instead of the slower translation component of nanorods therefore allows faster measurements and, crucially, smaller effective voxels for viscosity determination. We thus demonstrate that viscosity imaging is possible with a 0.5 (micron)^3 3D-resolution.

Abstract: With the adoption of the revised International System of Units (SI), the Kibble balance has become a pivotal instrument for mass calibrations against the Planck constant, $h$. One of the major focuses in the Kibble balance community is prioritizing experiments that achieve both high accuracy and compactness. The Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance experiment seeks to develop a compact, high-precision, user-friendly, cost-effective, and open-hardware apparatus for mass realization, specifically within the kilogram range. This paper reports on the progress of the Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance project over the past two years. Various aspects of the Tsinghua tabletop system, including electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and optical components, are summarized. Key achievements, such as the construction and characterization of the magnet system, determination of absolute gravitational acceleration, investigation of a capacitor-sensor-based weighing unit, and development of a high-precision current source, are presented to provide a comprehensive understanding of the experiment's status.

Abstract: The ability to image electromagnetic fields holds key scientific and industrial applications, including electromagnetic compatibility, diagnostics of high-frequency devices, and experimental scientific work involving field interactions. Generally electric and magnetic field measurements require conductive elements which significantly distort the field. However, electromagnetic fields can be measured without altering the field via the shift they induce on Rydberg states of alkali atoms in atomic vapor, which are highly sensitive to electric fields. Previous field measurements using Rydberg atoms utilized electromagnetically induced transparency to read out the shift on the states induced by the fields, but did not provide spatial resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that electromagnetically induced transparency can be spatially resolved by imaging the fluorescence of the atoms. We demonstrate that this can be used to image $\sim$V/cm scale electric fields in the DC-GHz range and $\sim$mT scale static magnetic fields, with minimal distortion to the fields. We also demonstrate the ability to image $\sim$ 100 V/cm scale fields for resonant microwave radiation and measure standing waves generated by the partial reflection of the vapor cell walls in this regime. With additional processing techniques like lock-in detection, we predict that our sensitivities could reach down to nV/cm levels. We perform this field imaging with a spatial resolution of 160 $\mu$m, limited by our imaging system, and estimate the fundamental resolution limitation to be 5 $\mu$m.

Abstract: Phased arrays are crucial in various technologies, such as radar and wireless communications, due to their ability to precisely control and steer electromagnetic waves. This precise control improves signal processing and enhances imaging performance. However, extending phased arrays to the terahertz (THz) frequency range has proven challenging, especially for high-frequency operation, broadband performance, two-dimensional (2D) phase control with large antenna arrays, and strong phase modulation. Here, we introduce a photonic platform to realize a THz phased array that bypasses the above challenges. Our method employs 2D phase coding with 2-bit across a broad THz frequency range from 0.8 to 1.4 THz. The core of our design is a pixelated nonlinear Pancharatnam-Berry metasurface driven by a spatially modulated femtosecond laser, allowing precise phase control of THz signals. We showcase the effectiveness of our method through four proof-of-concept applications: single beamforming, dual beamforming, imaging and vortex beam generation. The realized photonic platform provides a promising pathway for developing broadband phased arrays in the THz regime.

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is the key to explosive phenomena in the universe. The flux rope is crucial in three-dimensional magnetic reconnection theory and are commonly considered to be generated by secondary tearing mode instability. Here we show that the parallel electron flow moving toward the reconnection diffusion region can spontaneously form flux ropes. The electron flows form parallel current tubes in the separatrix region where the observational parameters suggest the tearing and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are suppressed. The spontaneously formed flux ropes could indicate the importance of electron dynamics in a three-dimensional reconnection region.

Abstract: MADMAX, an axion dark matter search experiment, is currently in the prototype testing phase. Its working principle is based on the conversion of axions in a magnetic field into photons. This signal is then enhanced by a booster made of dielectric disks placed in front of a mirror. In order to test MADMAX prototypes at cryogenic temperatures in a magnetic field parallel to the disks, a new G-10 glass-fiber cryostat of 0.25 m$^3$ inner volume was designed, tested and used in a CERN magnet. The design allows to minimise cost as well as cooling down and warming up times. Using continuous circulation flow of gaseous helium, the MADMAX prototype was cooled down reproducibly to temperatures below 10 K for more than 24 hours. This procedure allowed, for the first time, to perform a calibration of the booster response and to run a dark matter axion search in a magnetic field at low temperatures. This novel type of cryostat, with a low manufacturing cost, fast and easy to operate, could be used for other purposes beyond MADMAX.

arXiv:2412.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a terahertz (THz) gas sensing platform based on all-dielectric metasurfaces that support quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC) with both electric and magnetic dipole resonances. The structure is designed to achieve the first Kerker condition, minimizing backscattering and maximizing light-matter interaction, which significantly enhances the sensitivity of the sensor. By optimizing structural parameters, this metasurface selectively resonates at characteristic absorption frequencies of target gases, facilitating detection even at low concentrations. We validate the approach using two gases with strong but distinct THz absorption profiles: hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Furthermore, the free-standing design maximizes gas interaction on both sides of the metasurface, eliminating substrate-induced losses and enabling a reduced physical footprint. Our findings indicate that this metasurface outperforms standard THz sensing approaches in terms of compactness and sensitivity per path length unit, obtaining the same detection threshold as sensing in free space with a path length between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude shorter, underscoring its potential for industrial applications where the available space for sensing can be limited.

arXiv:2412.13105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are efficient and versatile electromagnetic structures that have already enabled the implementation of a wide range of microwave and photonic wave shaping applications. Despite the extensive research into metasurfaces, a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their angular dispersion remains vastly under-explored. Here, we use the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) to model and analyze the angular dispersive properties of metasurfaces. Based on this theoretical framework, we demonstrate that a metasurface may exhibit either partial or complete co- and cross-polarized transmission and reflection coefficients that are angle-invariant, meaning that their amplitude, phase, or both remain unchanged with varying incidence angles. We show that these angle-independent responses exist only when specific conditions, given in terms of the metasurface effective susceptibilities, are met. Using the GSTCs formalism, we derive several of these conditions and illustrate their scattering properties. Among other findings, this analysis reveals that, contrary to common assumptions, nonlocality (spatial dispersion) does not only increase the angular dispersion of a metasurface, but may also be used to achieve complete angle-invariant scattering. Additionally, this work demonstrates that fully efficient extrinsic chirality is possible with a pseudochiral metasurface in a partially angle-invariant fashion. We expect our work to provide a general strategy for eliminating, or at least reducing, angular-dependent scattering responses of metasurfaces, which may prove instrumental for applications that are highly sensitive to the detrimental effects of angular dispersion.

Abstract: Theory and modeling of new discovered effects of the oscillating e-beam boundary formed in a magnetic focusing channel on the stability, gain, and power of VE amplifiers are presented. The RF structure and e-beam circuit parameters are computed for different beam envelope radii and oscillation amplitudes and then the self-excitation thresholds are obtained from the Determinant equations. A new solution of the beam envelope equation not limited by the small-amplitude oscillations is derived and used to determine the magnetic focusing conditions providing various beam envelope radii and oscillation amplitudes. It is shown for the example Ka-band serpentine structure that the optimum radius as well as axial position of the oscillating beam envelope allow achieving significantly greater gain and power of RF amplifiers.

Abstract: The advancement of Rydberg Atomic REceiver (RARE) is driving a paradigm shift in electromagnetic (EM) wave measurement. RAREs utilize the electron transition phenomenon of highly-excited atoms to interact with EM waves, thereby enabling wireless signal detection. Operating at the quantum scale, such new receivers have the potential to breakthrough the sensitivity limit of classical receivers, sparking a revolution in physical-layer wireless communications. The objective of this paper is to offer insights into RARE-aided communication systems. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of RAREs. Then, a thorough comparison between RAREs and classical receivers is conducted in terms of the antenna size, sensitivity, coverage, and bandwidth. Subsequently, we overview the state-of-the-art design in RARE-aided wireless communications, exploring the latest progresses in frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input-multiple-output, wireless sensing, and quantum many-body techniques. Finally, we highlight several wireless-communication related open problems as important research directions.

Abstract: Since the discovery of ultrafast demagnetization in Ni thin films in 1996, laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics have become a prominent research topic in the field of magnetism and spintronics. This development offers new possibilities for the advancement of spintronics and magnetic storage technology. The subject has drawn a substantial number of researchers, leading to a series of research endeavors. Various models have been proposed to elucidate the physical processes underlying laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics in ferromagnetic materials. However, the potential origins of these processes across different material systems and the true contributions of these different origins remain challenging in the realm of ultrafast spin dynamics. This predicament also hinders the development of spintronic terahertz emitters. In this review, we initially introduce the different experimental methods used in laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics. We then systematically explore the magnetization precession process and present seven models of ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic materials. Subsequently, we discuss the physical processes and research status of four ultrafast demagnetization origins (including spin-flipping, spin transport, non-thermal electronic distribution, and laser-induced lattice strain). Since attosecond laser technique and antiferromagnetic materials exhibit promising applications in ultrahigh-frequency spintronics, we acknowledge the emerging studies used by attosecond pules and studies on ultrafast spin dynamics in antiferromagnets, noting the significant challenges that need to be addressed in these burgeoning field.

Abstract: This review article summarizes two decades of laboratory research aimed at understanding the dynamics of accretion disks, with particular emphasis on magnetohydrodynamic experiments involving liquid metals and plasmas. First, the Taylor-Couette experiments demonstrated the generation of magnetorotational instability (MRI) in liquid metals, and highlighted how this instability is critically influenced by boundary conditions and the geometry of the applied magnetic field. These experiments also highlight the nonlinear transition to turbulence in accretion disks, and their link with other MHD instabilities in centrifugally-stable flows. A complementary approach, involving laboratory experiments with volumetric fluid driving rather than rotating boundaries, enables a quantitative study of angular momentum transport by Keplerian turbulence. Collectively, these various laboratory studies offer new constraints on the theoretical models designed to explain the dynamics of accretion disks. This is particularly true with regard to the role of Keplerian turbulence in protoplanetary disks, where recent observations from the ALMA telescope have considerably revised previously expected values of the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations. Finally, the paper discusses outstanding questions and future prospects in laboratory modeling of accretion disks.

Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can increase nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals by orders of magnitude. DNP in diamond proceeds through different DNP mechanisms with a possible temperature-dependence. We report on 13C dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments in diamonds at 3.4 T and 7 T between 300 K and 1.7 K. Nuclear polarization enhancements between 100 and 600 were measured for all temperatures, corresponding to polarizations at 7 T between 0.1% (300 K) and 38% (1.7 K). A strong temperature dependence of the DNP profiles was observed. Longitudinal-detected (LOD) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments revealed an additional broad temperature-dependent electron line centered around the mI = 0 line of the P1 triplet transitions. Our results suggest that nuclei are preferentially polarized via a direct hyperfine mediated polarization transfer while spin diffusion in the sample plays a minor role.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the N\'eel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the N\'eel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.

Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.

Abstract: The most accurate neutron lifetime measurements now use the material or magnetic traps of ultracold neutrons (UCN). The precision of these experiments is determined by the accuracy of estimating the neutron loss rate. In material UCN traps the main source of neutron losses is the absorption by trap walls. In this paper we analyze the standard methods and their approximations for the calculation of UCN absorption rate by the walls of material traps. We emphasize the approximations used both in the standard analytical formulas and in the numerical Monte-Carlo simulations. For the two simplest trap geometries, rectangular and cylindrical, we obtain analytical formulas for this absorption rate provided the UCN velocity distribution is isotropic at trap bottom. Then we perform numerical calculations of UCN velocity distribution and absorption rate taking into account the diffuse elastic UCN reflections by trap walls obeying two different laws: Lambert`s cosine law and isotropic reflection. We compare the results with the standard estimation methods and discuss the differences. We indicate the difference between the UCN number and density velocity distribution. Our results may be useful to resolve the puzzling four-second discrepancy between the magnetic and material-trap measurements of neutron lifetime.

Abstract: Relativistic magnetic turbulence has been proposed as a process for producing nonthermal particles in high-energy astrophysics. Particle energization may be contributed by both magnetic reconnection and turbulent fluctuations, but their interplay is poorly understood. It has been suggested that during magnetic reconnection the parallel electric field dominates particle acceleration up to the lower bound of the power-law particle spectrum, but recent studies show that electric fields perpendicular to magnetic field can play an important, if not dominant role. In this study, we carry out 2D fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence in a relativistic pair plasma. For a fixed magnetization parameter $\sigma_0=20$, we find that the injection energy ${\varepsilon}_{\rm inj}$ converges with increasing domain size to ${\varepsilon}_{\rm inj}\simeq 10m_ec^2$. In contrast, the power-law index, the cut-off energy, and the power-law extent increase steadily with domain size. We trace a large number of particles and evaluate the contributions of the work done by the parallel ($W_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($W_\perp$) electric fields during both the injection phase and the post-injection phase. We find that during the injection phase, the $W_\perp$ contribution increases with domain size, suggesting that it may eventually dominate injection for a sufficiently large domain. In contrast, both components contribute equally during the post-injection phase, insensitive to the domain size. For high energy (${\varepsilon}\gg{\varepsilon}_{\rm inj}$) particles, $W_\perp$ dominates the subsequent energization. These findings may improve our understanding of nonthermal particles and their emissions in astrophysical plasmas.

Abstract: The paper presents solution of quantum problem of neutron propagation in the magnetic field with multipole field expansion. Rigorous solution of the Pauli equation for neutron reveals existence of two solutions, finite and infinite, for any multipole configuration.

To verify existence of finite and infinite motion, we discuss an experiment which could be performed in the Budker Insitute of Nuclear Physics using existing equipment. We conclude with considerations of neutron storage ring with straight section and discrete magnets focusing the beam.

Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength "squeezing", and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton-polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses that would enable their observation in cryo-SNOM experiments. Furthermore, by electrically tuning the excitons energy into the Reststrahlen band of the surrounding hexagonal-boron-nitride, we demonstrate that strong coupling between the excitons and hyperbolic phonon polaritons can be achieved, and well-described by an electromagnetic transmission line model. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable plasmonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.

# Proinflammatory and Prothrombotic Conditions in JAK2V617F-Positive MPN: A Case of Lemierre&rsquo;s Syndrome in Essential Thrombocythemia

## JAK2V617F-Positive MPN的促炎性和血栓形成性疾病: 原发性血小板增多症的Lemierre综合征一例

Lemierre&rsquo;s syndrome (LS) represents a rare yet potentially life-threatening systemic infection, characterized by thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and abscess formation in distant organs. It typically follows episodes of tonsillitis or other infections of the oropharyngeal region. Pulmonary complications, including septic pulmonary emboli, are common. Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) sometimes associated with the JAK2V617F mutation, which predisposes patients to thrombotic events. A 66-year-old male with JAK2V617F-positive ET presented with severe pulsatile pain radiating from the right temporal region to the occipital area following a recent dental infection. Although pain management was administered, the pain continued to persist. Computed tomography of the chest revealed multiple subpleural nodules, raising suspicion for septic pulmonary emboli. Further investigation with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified a thrombus extending from the right sigmoid sinus into the internal jugular vein, consistent with cerebral venous thrombosis. The patient was diagnosed with LS, complicated by septic thrombosis. Blood cultures yielded alpha-hemolytic streptococcus. Empirical antimicrobial therapy combined with anticoagulation was initiated, resulting in a gradual improvement of symptoms, including the resolution of fever and pain. Follow-up imaging confirmed the resolution of both the infection and thrombosis. This is the first reported case of LS in a patient with JAK2V617F-positive ET. The coexistence of LS and JAK2V617F-positive MPN highlights the potential interplay between proinflammatory and prothrombotic conditions associated with the JAK2V617F mutation.

# Aneurysmal Bone Cysts (Abc): Retrospective Analysis of 258 Cases

## 动脉瘤样骨囊肿 (Abc) 258例回顾性分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5379542/latest

Puspose: Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) are bone tumours characterised by blood-filled cystic lesions. Management strategies for ABCs vary widely and lack consensus. This study aims to evaluate outcomes in 258 patients and investigate the factors affecting the recurrence rates.
Methods: This study is a single-centre retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with ABC between January 1990 and December 2020. Patients who were histologically diagnosed with ABC, had available pathology, radiology, and surgery records, and were followed up for at least 24 months were included. Secondary ABCs were excluded. Presenting symptoms and location, computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), treatment modalities, and recurrence were investigated.
Results: &amp;nbsp;The mean age of the 258 ABC patients was 17.25 &plusmn; 12.37 years, 67.44% being under 18 years, and 12.40% under 5 years. 49.45% were female. The average follow-up duration was 47.80 &plusmn; 41.92 months. Pain was the most common presenting symptom, reported by 79.97% of patients. 5.04% were asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally, whereas 11.63% were diagnosed following a pathological fracture. The median disease-free survival was 10 months, with the average time to first recurrence being 24.22 &plusmn; 22.14 months. Recurrence was more common in patients under 5 years of age (34.38% vs 19.03%, p=0.046) and in those with pathologic fractures (40.00% vs 18.42%, p=0.006). Conversely, recurrence was less common when burr and/or cautery was added to curettage (31.97% vs. 11.03%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Time to recurrence was significantly shorter in cases with soft tissue oedema (median 5 vs 12 months, p=0.010) or fluid-fluid levels (median 6 vs 12 months, p=0.038).
Conclusions: The study found that pathological fractures and age under 5 years are associated with a higher risk of recurrence in aneurysmal bone cysts. In contrast, adding electrocautery or burring to curettage significantly reduces recurrence rates.
Level of evidence: Level 3, therapeutic

# Prenatal Exome Sequencing of Fetuses with Central Nervous System Anomalies Based on Prenatal Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Diagnosis &mdash; A Retrospective Cohort Study and System Review

## 基于产前超声和磁共振成像诊断的中枢神经系统异常胎儿的产前外显子组测序-回顾性队列研究和系统评价

Background Assessing the incremental yield of prenatal exome sequencing (ES) over chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) in the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) anomalies based on prenatal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnoses.Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we collected the ES results of fetuses diagnosed with CNS anomalies through prenatal ultrasound and MRI between 2019 and 2023, who also had negative CMA results. We performed subgroup analyses to assess detection rates for different phenotypes in order to identify associated genes and variants. A meta-analysis combining our study with relevant research was performed to further explore the association between phenotype and ES.Results In the cohort study of 219 cases, ES identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic single nucleotide variations in 36 cases (16%). The highest detection rate was observed in cases with multisystem malformations (25%, 14/55), followed by multiple CNS anomalies (15%, 2/13) and isolated CNS anomaly (13%, 20/151). The most commonly identified isolated CNS anomaly was agenesis of the corpus callosum (31%, 5/16). Neural tube defects with urogenital anomalies were strongly linked to positive ES results (57%, 4/7). The meta-analysis of 989 cases from 22 studies showed a pooled ES diagnostic yield of 27% [(95% (CI), 21&amp;ndash;34%)]. The highest detection rates were in cases of corpus callosum anomalies with facial abnormalities (75%, 8/11) and neural tube defects with urogenital malformations (80%, 12/15). The detection rate for three or more types of complex central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities was 43% (95% confidence interval, 31%-58%), which was significantly higher than that for only two abnormalities, which was 10% [(95% (CI), 4%-18%). No significant difference in diagnostic yield was found between cases identified by prenatal MRI combined with ultrasound [27% (95% confidence interval, 20&amp;ndash;36%)] and those identified by ultrasound alone [25% (95% confidence interval, 17&amp;ndash;35%)].Conclusions ES provided a significantly higher diagnostic yield than CMA for fetuses with CNS abnormalities. Additionally, diagnostic rates for variants varied across different phenotypic abnormalities.

# Proton Transport from the Antimatter Factory of CERN

## 来自CERN反物质工厂的质子运输

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5627457/latest

The antiproton is a basic constituent of antimatter and required for stringent matter-antimatter comparisons to test the fundamental charge-parity-time (CPT) reversal invariance in the Standard Model of particle physics (1). Using low energy antiprotons, only available at the antimatter factory (AMF) located at CERN (2), such tests have been realized for example in the high-precision spectroscopy of antiprotonic atoms (3), and antihydrogen (4). In our cryogenic Penning-trap experiments (5), we measure the fundamental properties of protons and antiprotons and conduct CPT tests comparing their magnetic moments with a precision of 1.5 parts per billion (6, 7), as well as the most precise test of CPT invariance in the baryon sector by comparing their charge-to-mass ratios to a relative uncertainty of 16 parts-per-trillion(8). Although innovative shielding systems have been implemented (9), our experiments are limited by magnetic field fluctuations imposed by the accelerators in the AMF. To push the limits of our measurements, we are advancing the relocation of antiprotons to dedicated precision laboratories. This work presents a critical milestone in this endeavor: the successful transport of a trapped proton cloud from the AMF using BASE-STEP (10) &mdash; a transportable, superconducting, persistent, autonomous, and open Penning-trap system. We transferred the trapped protons from our experimental area at the AMF onto a truck and transported them across CERN&rsquo;s Meyrin site. We demonstrated loss-free proton relocation, sustaining autonomous operation without external power for four hours, thereby confirming the feasibility of transferring particles to low-noise laboratory environments. The transport range of this system can be extended using mobile power generators (11) to reach laboratories throughout Europe. Our achievement represents a breakthrough and a potential start of a new era in precision antimatter research by conducting antiproton spectroscopy in low-noise laboratories. It also enables transportation and offline studies of other exotic ions, such as highly-charged ions produced in accelerators (12) or high-end EBITs (13), and the charged antimatter ions H&macr; + (14) and H&macr;2 (15)

# Utility of Prostate-Specific Antigen Derivatives to Minimize Unnecessary Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Prior Negative Prostate Biopsy Running title: PSAD to Minimize MRI in Prior Negative Prostate Biopsy

## 前列腺特异性抗原衍生物的效用，以最大限度地减少不必要的磁共振成像患者与先前的阴性前列腺活检运行标题: PSAD，以最大限度地减少MRI在先前的阴性前列腺活检

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important tool for recommending prostate biopsy (PB) in prostate cancer (PCa) detection. However, the routine use of MRI in patients with previous negative PB remains debatable. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) derivatives to guide MRI use and reduce unnecessary scans in such cases. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score&amp;thinsp;&amp;ge;&amp;thinsp;4 as the optimal threshold for predicting clinically significant PCa (Gleason score&amp;thinsp;&amp;ge;&amp;thinsp;7). A cohort of 251 patients with at least one prior negative PB who underwent serum PSA testing, free PSA, and MRI between October 2015 and June 2024 were analyzed. The optimal cutoff values for PSA, PSA density (PSAD), and free-to-total PSA ratio (%fPSA) were 11.87 ng/mL, 0.19 ng/mL2, and 18.76%, respectively (all p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001). Restricting MRI to patients with PSA&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;11.87 ng/mL, PSAD&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.19 ng/mL2, or %fPSA&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;18.76% could induce MRI use by 22.7% while missing only 9.1% of significant PCa cases on MRI-targeted PB.

# Intraprocedural O-arm Computed Tomography guided Navigation with Ventilatory Strategy for Atelectasis Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopic Biopsy of Peripheral Lung Lesions: an IDEAL stage 2a study

## 术中O臂计算机断层扫描引导的通气导航治疗肺不张电磁导航支气管镜活检周围肺病变: 一项理想的2a期研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5426178/latest

Background: To improve the accuracy of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) in the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules, we developed an innovative method to modify ENB, which first combines Intraprocedural Computed tomography (CT) guided navigation with Ventilatory strategy for Atelectasis (ICNVA).
Methods: This was a retrospective single-institution study in alignment with the IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow-up) 's prescribed developmental stages 2a. Patients who planned to undergo ENB for pulmonary lesion biopsy were invited to participate. For each patient, we do not use preoperative chest CT data in the conventional ENB approach for navigation planning. Instead, after endotracheal intubation under general anesthesia and bronchoscope insertion into the endotracheal tube, we used O-arm CT scanner in the hybrid operating room to acquire intraoperative CT data for ENB path planning. Following endotracheal intubation under general anesthesia, a ventilation strategy to prevent lung collapse is employed to reduce the occurrence of atelectasis. Moreover, the same ventilation parameters were used when intraoperative CT data was acquired and ENB procedures was performed to minimize computed tomography to body divergence (CTBD) to the greatest extent possible. 50 consecutive participants completed this study beginning in March 2022. We have iteratively adjusted the technology. In accordance with the IDEAL recommendations, we recorded the technological modifications and general characteristics of each patient and ENB related data.
Results: All patients completed biopsy successfully. 2 patients developed pneumothorax, and 2 patients experienced bleeding but did not require surgical treatment. Four deliberate changes in technique occurred. After the first technological modification, ENB related security improved. After starting to establish puncture tunneling by using Wang's needle (MW-319), the ENB accuracy was significantly improved. After the CT scan area was reduced, the radiation dose to patients was reduced.
Conclusions: ICNVA-ENB has early indications for safety and efficacy in the biopsy of peripheral lung lesions.

# Perceived control as a resilience factor: Influences on neural, physiological and affective stress responses and mental health

## 感知控制作为一种弹性因素: 对神经，生理和情感应激反应和心理健康的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5189916/latest

Perceived control is a key mechanism implicated in stress resilience. A tendency to perceive control over stressors may protect individuals against negative outcomes across various situations by increasing active coping and preventing exacerbated stress reactions. Assuming that individual differences in perceived control during an uncontrollable stress task may represent an underlying resilience factor, we investigated associations of perceived control with neural, endocrine, and affective responses to a different, psychosocial stressor, and with overall mental health. 116 male participants aged 18-30 completed a psychosocial stress task, and we assessed stress responses via functional magnetic resonance imaging, cortisol levels, and affective state questionnaires. General mental health was assessed via self-report. Perceived control was measured during a second, uncontrollable stress task and growth mixture modeling revealed a high- and a low-control class. Comparison of these classes showed that the high-control class experienced less helplessness during the uncontrollability task and demonstrated more flexible responses to psychosocial stress as reflected in cortisol secretion and activation of the bilateral posterior insula. Further, the high-control class reported fewer psychosomatic symptoms and a less external locus of control. These findings suggest that perceived control acts as a resilience factor, influencing stress processing across multiple domains. The study highlights the potential for perceived control to be harnessed in resilience-building interventions and underscores the need for further experimental and longitudinal research to confirm its role in modulating stress responses.
