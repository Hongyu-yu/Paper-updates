Author(s): Benjamin Strekha, Alessio Amaolo, Jewel Mohajan, Pengning Chao, Sean Molesky, and Alejandro W. Rodriguez<br /><p>The authors lay out a framework for understanding the optimal performance of practical electromagnetic cloaking devices, providing new theoretical insights for future designs and showing how perfect cloaking is impossible even for a vanishing bandwidth for finite cloak sizes with bounded refractive index contrasts or material losses. The framework is exemplified by designing a cloak for a circular object in two dimensions.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRA/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevA.110.063513.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

# Unravelling antisymmetric exchange in a coordination polymer made of copper chloride and triazole

**Authors:** Michael, Eisterer

The present work reports the synthesis, structure, and magnetic properties of a one-dimensional coordination polymer made of copper(II) chloride and 1,2,4- triazole. The coordination polymer is synthesized in hydrochloric acid at room temperature. The structure determination by single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals an array of copper atoms bridged via two chlorine and a triazole.  Magnetisation data show no hysteresis at temperatures down to 2 K, but suggest antisymmetric exchange and antiferromagnetic coupling between the neighbouring spins of Cu(II) ions.  This work gives impetus for the synthesis of large crystals of coordination polymers based on which magnetic properties can be studied in depth.

# Safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with Tislelizumab plus chemotherapy for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a single-arm, retrospective study

## Tislelizumab联合化疗新辅助治疗局部晚期头颈部鳞状细胞癌的安全性和有效性: 一项单臂回顾性研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5405978/latest

Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a very common type of head and neck cancer, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is only 50%. Inhibitors targeting the Programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway have gained widespread clinical adoption. However, the relationship between the infiltration characteristics of immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and the effect of immunotherapy on HNSCC remains to be explored.Methods  Patients diagnosed with HNSCC who received Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy were reviewed between February 2021 and March 30, 2024 in our single center. The laryngoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathologic response were evaluated to the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with Tislelizumab plus chemotherapy treatment. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.Result Our analysis involved 42 patients who received Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy. A total of 18 patients underwent surgical treatment following the completion of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Among them, 6 patients achieved pCR (33%). The 1-year OS rate of the 42 patients enrolled in the study was 95.05%, and the 1-year PFS rate was 89.86%. There was a significant positive correlation between the lymphocyte density in HNSCC prior to the administration of neoadjuvant PD1-inhibitor therapy combined with chemotherapy and the immunotherapy efficacy. Compared with pretreatment, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly decreased and the lymphocyte density was significantly increased in HNSCC patients after immunotherapy.Conclusions The integration of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy with chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective strategy, can improve the tumor response rate and survival rate, and is a valuable treatment for patients with HNSCC. Furthermore, the study suggests that an elevated NLR within the HNSCC tumor microenvironment could potentially serve as a biomarker indicative of diminished immunotherapy efficacy.

# Diagnostic performance of MRI signs of intracranial hypertension for high CSF opening pressure in children: A retrospective case-control study

## 儿童高脑脊液开放压的颅内高压MRI征象的诊断表现: 回顾性病例对照研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5364061/latest

Background and Purpose: The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) signs of intracranial hypertension (ICH) in children remains unclear. This study aims to assess how brain MR signs of ICH correlate with cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure (CSFOP).
Materials and Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted with 77 children aged 1 to 18 years, who underwent brain MR and lumbar puncture with CSFOP measurement. The ICH group included 38 patients (49.3%) and the control group 39 (50.7%). A blinded radiologist evaluated key ICH signs, including distension of the perioptic subarachnoid space, optic nerve (ON) tortuosity, posterior scleral flattening, intraocular protrusion, and enhancement of the prelaminar ON, among others. Odds ratios, likelihood ratios, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) were calculated in relation to CSFOP, adjusted for age and sex.
Results: The presence of four or more MR signs of ICH provided the best diagnostic performance (specificity 92%, sensitivity 40%, AUROC 0.759) for identifying elevated CSFOP, particularly with intraocular protrusion of the prelaminar ON (p = 0.006, median CSFOP 49.6 cmH2O, p &amp;lt;.001) and papilledema (p = 0.042).
Conclusion: The presence of four or more MR signs can accurately predict elevated CSFOP in children with non-structural ICH.

# Prediction of antipsychotic drug efficacy for schizophrenia treatment based on neural features of the resting-state functional connectome

## 基于静息态功能连接组神经特征预测抗精神病药物治疗精神分裂症的疗效

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5368102/latest

Neuroimaging studies have identified a large number of biomarkers associated with schizophrenia (SZ), but there is still a lack of biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of antipsychotic medication in SZ patients. The aim of this study was to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of antipsychotic drug response among features of the resting-state connectome. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance scans were acquired from a discovery cohort of 105 patients with SZ at baseline and after 8 weeks of antipsychotic medication treatment. Baseline clinical status and post-treatment outcome were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and clinical improvement was rated by the total score reduction. Based on acquired imaging data, a resting-state functional connectivity matrix was constructed for each patient, and a connectome-based predictive model was subsequently established and trained to predict individual PANSS total score reduction. Model performance was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and true score reduction with leave-one-out cross-validation. Finally, the generalizability of the model was tested using an independent validation cohort of 52 SZ patients. The model incorporating resting-state connectome characteristics predicted individual treatment outcomes in both the discovery cohort (prediction vs. truth r&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.59, mean squared error (MSE)&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.021) and validation cohort (r&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.41, MSE&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.036). The model identified four positive features and eight negative features, which were respectively correlated positively and negatively with PANSS total score reduction. Among these positive features, the specific connections within the parietal lobe played a crucial role in the model's predictive performance. As for the negative features, they included the frontoparietal control network and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical connections. This study discovered and validated a set of functional features based on resting-state connectome, where higher connectivity of positive features and lower connectivity of negative features at baseline were associated with a higher reduction rate of PANSS total score in patients and a better therapeutic effect. These functional features can be used to predict the PANSS total score reduction rate of SZ patients through a model. Clinical doctors can potentially infer the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication treatment for patients based on the predicted results.
