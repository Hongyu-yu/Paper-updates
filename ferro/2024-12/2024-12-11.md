# Unravelling antisymmetric exchange in a coordination polymer made of copper chloride and triazole

## 解开由氯化铜和三唑制成的配位聚合物中的反对称交换

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-1hrrp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Michael, Eisterer

The present work reports the synthesis, structure, and magnetic properties of a one-dimensional coordination polymer made of copper(II) chloride and 1,2,4- triazole. The coordination polymer is synthesized in hydrochloric acid at room temperature. The structure determination by single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals an array of copper atoms bridged via two chlorine and a triazole.  Magnetisation data show no hysteresis at temperatures down to 2 K, but suggest antisymmetric exchange and antiferromagnetic coupling between the neighbouring spins of Cu(II) ions.  This work gives impetus for the synthesis of large crystals of coordination polymers based on which magnetic properties can be studied in depth.

# A single outer-sphere amino-acid substitution turns on the NO reactivity of a hemerythrin-like protein

## 单个外层氨基酸取代会导致类血红素蛋白的NO反应性

**Authors:** EKATERINA, PLETNEVA

Mycobacterial hemerythrin-like proteins (HLPs) are important for the survival of pathogens in macrophages. Their molecular mechanisms of function remain poorly defined but recent studies point to their possible role in nitric oxide (NO) scavenging. Unlike any nonheme diiron protein studied so far, the diferric HLP from Mycobacterium kansasii (Mka-HLP) reacts with NO in a multistep fashion to consume four NO molecules per diiron center. HLPs are largely conserved across mycobacteria and we argued that comparative studies of distant orthologs may illuminate the role of the protein scaffold in this reactivity and yield intermediates with properties more favorable for detailed spectroscopic characterization. Herein, we show that HLP from Azotobacter vinelandii (Avi-HLP) requires a single T47F point mutation in the outer sphere of its diferric center to adopt a bridging mu-oxo diferric structure alike that of Mka-HLP that makes it reactive toward NO. Radical combination of NO with the mu-oxo bridge yields nitrite and a mixed valent Fe(III)Fe(II) cluster that further react with NO to produce a stable magnetically coupled Fe(III){FeNO}7 cluster. We report characterization of this stable cluster by electronic absorption, EPR, FTIR and resonance Raman spectroscopies and suggest ways Phe 46 (Mka numbering) might control the Fe(III) reduction potential and the NO reactivity of HLPs.

# Altermagnetism: A Chemical Perspective

## 磁: 化学观点

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-bst3p?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Kwabena, Bediako

Altermagnets have been recently introduced as a classification of collinear, spin compensated magnetic materials that host net-zero magnetization, yet display some electronic behaviors typically associated with non-compensated magnetic materials like ferromagnets. The emergence of such properties are a consequence of spin-split bands that arise under specific symmetry conditions in the limit of zero spin–orbit coupling. In this Perspective, we summarize the fundamental criteria for realizing an altermagnetic phase and present a qualitative electronic band structure derivation and symmetry analysis through chemical principles. We then discuss the properties that make altermagnets distinctive candidates for charge-to-spin conversion elements in spintronic devices, and provide a brief review of some altermagnetic candidate materials. Finally, we discuss future directions for altermagnetism and highlight opportunities for chemists to advance this emerging field.

# Prediction of antipsychotic drug efficacy for schizophrenia treatment based on neural features of the resting-state functional connectome

## 基于静息态功能连接组神经特征预测抗精神病药物治疗精神分裂症的疗效

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5368102/latest

Neuroimaging studies have identified a large number of biomarkers associated with schizophrenia (SZ), but there is still a lack of biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of antipsychotic medication in SZ patients. The aim of this study was to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of antipsychotic drug response among features of the resting-state connectome. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance scans were acquired from a discovery cohort of 105 patients with SZ at baseline and after 8 weeks of antipsychotic medication treatment. Baseline clinical status and post-treatment outcome were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and clinical improvement was rated by the total score reduction. Based on acquired imaging data, a resting-state functional connectivity matrix was constructed for each patient, and a connectome-based predictive model was subsequently established and trained to predict individual PANSS total score reduction. Model performance was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and true score reduction with leave-one-out cross-validation. Finally, the generalizability of the model was tested using an independent validation cohort of 52 SZ patients. The model incorporating resting-state connectome characteristics predicted individual treatment outcomes in both the discovery cohort (prediction vs. truth r&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.59, mean squared error (MSE)&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.021) and validation cohort (r&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.41, MSE&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.036). The model identified four positive features and eight negative features, which were respectively correlated positively and negatively with PANSS total score reduction. Among these positive features, the specific connections within the parietal lobe played a crucial role in the model's predictive performance. As for the negative features, they included the frontoparietal control network and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical connections. This study discovered and validated a set of functional features based on resting-state connectome, where higher connectivity of positive features and lower connectivity of negative features at baseline were associated with a higher reduction rate of PANSS total score in patients and a better therapeutic effect. These functional features can be used to predict the PANSS total score reduction rate of SZ patients through a model. Clinical doctors can potentially infer the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication treatment for patients based on the predicted results.
