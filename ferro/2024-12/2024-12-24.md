At the Berlin synchrotron radiation source BESSY II, the largest magnetic anisotropy of a single molecule ever measured experimentally has been determined. The larger a molecule's anisotropy is, the better suited it is as a molecular nanomagnet. Such nanomagnets have a wide range of potential applications, for example, in energy-efficient data storage.

**Authors:** Benjamin Michen, Tim Pokart, Jan Carl Budich

arXiv:2412.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a protocol to adiabatically prepare the ground state of a widely discussed number-conserving model Hamiltonian for ultracold atoms in optical lattices that supports Majorana edge states. In particular, we introduce a symmetry breaking mass term that amounts to threading a commensurate (artificial) magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the considered two-leg ladder which opens a constant bulk gap. This enables the preparation of the topological Majorana phase from a trivial Mott insulator state with optimal asymptotic scaling of the ramp time in system size, which is linear owing to the critical nature of the target state. Using constructive bosonization techniques that account for both finite size effects and global fermion number conservation, we are able to fully explain with theory the somewhat counterintuitive necessity of the aforementioned commensurate flux for a controlled bulk gap. Our analytical predictions are corroborated and quantified by unbiased numerical matrix product states (MPS) simulations. Directly building up on previous experimental work, the crucial flux-term of the proposed protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques in atomic quantum simulators.

# Dynamics of metastable contact soliton dissipative exchange flows in one-dimensional ferromagnetic channels

## 一维铁磁通道中亚稳态接触孤子耗散交换流的动力学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15362

**Authors:** Medhanie Estiphanos, Ezio Iacocca

arXiv:2412.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative exchange flows (DEFs) are large-amplitude boundary value solutions of ferromagnetic channels. In their low-injection limit, DEFs reduce to spin superfluids. However, in the strong injection limit, nonlinearities dominate close to the injection site and a soliton is formed; this solution has been termed a contact soliton dissipative exchange flow (CS-DEF). Here, we numerically investigate CS-DEF solutions in a moderate injection regime and a finite injection width. We find a solution where two metastable solitons coexist in the injection region. This solution is metastable in the sense that any perturbation to the system will eject one of the solitons out of the injection region. Moreover, soliton dynamics can be excited when two injection regions are separated by a certain distance. We find that the ensuing DEF between the solitons induces a steady-state dynamics in which metastable solitons are continually ejected and nucleated. Furthermore, and depending on the relative signs of the spin injections, the soliton dynamics possess a particular handedness and frequency related to the spin transfer torque delivered by the DEF. Our results provide insights into the transport of spin current by DEFs - where the interaction between DEFs and solitons suggests a mechanism for detaching contact-solitons from the injection boundary. Although this study focuses on the "nonlocal" interaction between solitons, it may lead to the investigation of new mechanisms for inserting solitons in a DEF, e.g., for discrete motion and transport of information over long distances.

# Confinement-induced altermangetism in RuO$_2$ thin films

## RuO $_2 $ 薄膜中的限制诱导的altermangetism

**Authors:** Samy Brahimi, Dibya Prakash Rai, Samir Lounis

arXiv:2412.15377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of bulk RuO$_2$ remain a subject of active debate, despite its pivotal role in the emergence of altermagnetism. The latter is a novel paradigm in magnetic phases, characterized by the absence of net magnetization due to anti-parallel alignment of magnetic moments, yet displaying finite spin-splitting in the electronic band structure. This unique behavior unlocks opportunities for advanced applications in information technology devices. Recent experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that bulk RuO$_2$, contrary to prior assumptions, is non-magnetic. In this work, we propose the fabrication of RuO$_2$ thin films to robustly stabilize the altermagnetic phase. Unlike their bulk counterparts, thin films experience substantial strain relaxation, leading to a dramatic impact on the electronic structure that triggers a transition towards an altermagnetic behavior, which mimics the impact of an artificially applied Hubbard-U correction to account for electronic correlations. Our findings promote the use and exploration of thin films for the realization of spintronic devices based on altermagnets.

# Frustrated magnetism in Mn films on Ag(111) surface: from chiral in-plane N\'eel state to row-wise antiferromagnetism

**Authors:** Selcuk S\"ozeri, Nihad Abuawwad, Amal Aldarawsheh, Samir Lounis

arXiv:2412.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study to explore the intricate magnetic properties of frustrated Mn monolayer on the Ag(111) surface. Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy demonstrates that a N\'eel magnetic state characterizes such an interface, which contradicts systematic ab-initio predictions made in the last two decades indicating that the ground state is collinear row-wise antiferromagnetic (RW-AFM) state. Here, we employ the all-electron full-potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function (KKR) method and find that the ground state is a chiral magnetic N\'eel state, with magnetic moments rotating in the surface plane following a unique sense of rotation, as dictated by the underlying in-plane magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Once allowing disordered magnetic states, as described within the disordered local moment (DLM) approach, we reveal the possibility of stabilization of a RW-AFM state. We conjecture that at low temperatures, the chiral N\'eel state prevails, while at higher temperatures, the magnetic exchange interactions are modified by magnetic disorder, which can then induce a transition towards a RW-AFM state. Our work addresses a long term experimental-theoretical controversy and provides significant insights into the magnetic interactions and stability of Mn films on noble metal substrates, contributing to the broader understanding of the different magnetic facets of frustrated magnetism in thin films.

# Long-range exchange coupling in a magnetic multilayer system

**Authors:** L. O. Souza, R. A. Dumer, M. Godoy

arXiv:2412.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explored the magnetic coupling in a multilayer system consisting of thin layers separated by a distance $d$. We have employed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to calculate the thermodynamic quantities such as the magnetization per spin $m_{L}^{\mu}$, magnetic susceptibility $\chi_{L}^{\mu}$, and the reduced fourth-order Binder cumulant $U_{L}^{\mu}$ as a function of temperature $T$ and for several values of lattice size $L$. These quantities were obtained for each layer ($\mu=l)$, for the bulk system ($\mu=b)$, as a function of interlayer distance $d$ and the parameter $\alpha$ that defines the scale length of the exponential decay of the interaction. Furthermore, we applied the finite-size scaling theory to calculate the critical exponents. Our results reveal that the system exhibits 2D Ising exponents when the layers are sufficiently separated. On the other hand, in the compact limit, where $d$ equals the distance between two adjacent sites within the same layer, our bulk results show that the system exhibits 3D Ising critical exponents, provided that the number of layers $L_{z}$ increases proportionally to the layer sizes. Even with the separation increasing up to $d=2.0$, the layers are so correlated that the set of critical exponents retains the values of 3D critical exponents. However, when the number of layers $L_{z}$ remains fixed, even in the compact limit with periodic boundary conditions, only the exponent $\beta$ aligns closely with the predicted literature values, on the other hand, the other exponents show significant deviations.

arXiv:2412.15512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping properties of Bi, Cr and Ag dopants in thermoelectric and topological materials PbTe and SnTe are analyzed based on density functional theory calculations in the local density approximations and the large supercell method. In agreement with experiment, in both PbTe and SnTe, Bi is a donor and Ag is an acceptor with a vanishing magnetic moment. In contrast, Cr is a resonant donor in PbTe, and an resonant acceptor in SnTe. We also consider the electronic structure of cation vacancies in PbTe and SnTe, since these abundant native defects induce $p$-type conductivity in both hosts. The quantitatively different impact of these dopants/defects on the host band structure of PbTe and SnTe (level energies, band splittings, band inversion, and a different level of hybridization between dopant and host states) is explained based on the group-theoretical arguments.

Abstract: The discovery of the nonlinear Hall effect provides an avenue for studying the interplay among symmetry, topology, and phase transitions, with potential applications in signal doubling and high-frequency rectification. However, practical applications require devices fabricated on large area thin film as well as room-temperature operation. Here, we demonstrate robust room-temperature nonlinear transverse response and microwave rectification in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We observe multiple sign-reversals in the nonlinear response by tuning the chemical potential. Through theoretical analysis, we identify skew scattering and side jump, arising from extrinsic spin-orbit scattering, as the main mechanisms underlying the observed nonlinear signals. Furthermore, we demonstrate radio frequency (RF) rectification in the range of 1-8 gigahertz at 300 K. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the relationship between nonlinear response and magnetism, but also expand the potential applications as energy harvesters and detectors in high-frequency scenarios.

Abstract: Magnetoresistance oscillations in semiconductor quantum wells, with the semi-parabolic plus semi-inverse squared potential, under the influence of intense electromagnetic waves (IEMW), is studied theoretically. Analytical expression for the longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) is derived from the quantum kinetic equation for electrons, using the Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian of the electron-acoustic phonon system. Numerical calculation results show the complex dependence of LMR on the parameters of the external field (electric, magnetic field and temperature) as well as the structure parameters of the confinement potential. In the absence of IMEW, Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations appear with amplitudes that decrease with temperature in agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results. In the presence of IEMW, the SdH oscillations appear in beats with amplitudes that increase with the intensity of the IEMW. SdH oscillations under the influence of electromagnetic waves are called microwave-induced magnetoresistance oscillations. The maximum and minimum peaks appear at the positions where the IEMW frequencies are integer and half-integer values of the cyclotron frequency, respectively. In addition, the structural parameters of the quantum well such as the confinement frequency and the geometrical parameters have a significant influence on the LMR as well as the SdH oscillations. When the confinement frequency is small, the two-dimensional electronic system in the quantum well behaves as a bulk semiconductor, resulting in the absence of SdH oscillations. In addition, the LMR increases with the geometrical parameter $\beta_z$ of the quantum well. The obtained results provide a solid theoretical foundation for the possibility of controlling SdH oscillations by IEMW as well as the structural properties of materials in future experimental observations.

# Effects of magnetic field and structural parameters on multi-photon absorption spectra in Morse quantum wells with electron-phonon interactions

Abstract: We present a systematic theoretical study of the multi-photon nonlinear optical absorption properties of a $\text{GaAs/A}{{\text{l}}_{x}}\text{G}{{\text{a}}_{1-x}}\text{As}$ based quantum well (QW) structure with Morse confinement potential under the influence of a magnetic field. Based on the stationary states due to the electron confinement in Morse QWs and the Landau levels obtained by solving the Schrodinger equation in the effective mass approximation, we have developed calculations for the optical absorption power with MPA using second-order perturbation theory. Our model accounts for electron-phonon interactions and considers both optical and acoustic phonon mechanisms in the MPA process. Our findings show that the one-photon absorption (1PA) peaks are larger and appear to the right of the two-photon absorption (2PA) peaks, whereas 2PA peaks are larger and occur to the right of three-photon absorption (3PA) peaks. The resonance peak positions follow the magneto-phonon resonance condition and are temperature-independent. Increasing the magnetic field and aluminum concentration induces a blue shift in the absorption spectra, whereas increasing the QW width leads to a red shift. Variations in magnetic field, aluminum concentration, and QW width also affect the peak intensities and full-width at half maximum (FWHM), with increasing values of the former two enhancing the FWHM, while expanding the QW width reduces it. Thermal excitations increase peak intensity without shifting their positions. Our study highlights the significance of nonlinear absorption processes (2PA, 3PA) in understanding optical absorption, despite their smaller FWHM compared to linear absorption (1PA). Overall, the Morse QW model demonstrates promising magneto-optical properties, making it a strong candidate for future optoelectronic device applications.

Abstract: Based on the quantum kinetic equation for electrons, we theoretically study the quantum multi-photon non-linear absorption of a strong electromagnetic wave (EMW) in two-dimensional graphene. Two cases of the electron scattering mechanism are considered: Electron-optical phonon scattering and electron-acoustic phonon scattering. The general multi-photon absorption coefficient is presented as a function of the temperature, the external magnetic field, the photon energy and the amplitude of external EMW. These analytical expressions for multi-photon non-linear absorption coefficient (MNAC) are numerically calculated and the results are discussed in both the absence and presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene sheet. The results show that there is no absorption peak in the absence of the magnetic field, which contrasts with previous results in 2D systems such as quantum wells or superlattices. However, when there is a strong magnetic field along the direction perpendicular to the 2D graphene, absorption spectral lines appear consistent with the magneto-phonon resonance conditions. Our calculations show that the MPA's effect is stronger than mono-photon absorption. Besides, the quantum multi-photon non-linear absorption phenomenon has been studied from low to high temperatures. This transcends the limits of the classical BKE which is studied in the high-temperature domain. The computational results show that the dependence of MNAC on the above quantities is consistent with the previous theoretical investigation. Another novel feature of this work is that the general analytic expression for MNAC shows the Half Width at Half Maximum dependence on the magnetic field which is in good agreement with the previous experimental observations. Thus, our estimation might give a critical prediction for future experimental observations in 2D graphene.

Abstract: The one-dimensional flat-band ferromagnetic Tasaki model exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking from ${\rm SU}(2)$ to ${\rm U}(1)$ with one type-B Goldstone mode, featuring that the highest weight state is entangled at quarter filling, but there is always a choice to keep the highest weight state unentangled away from quarter filling. It is found that the ground-state degeneracies under both periodic and open boundary conditions constitute essentially the Fibonacci sequences, behaving asymptotically as the golden spiral - a self-similar geometric object. A set of orthonormal basis states are generated from the repeated action of the lowering operator of the symmetry group ${\rm SU}(2)$ on the highest weight state at a specific filling. In particular, it is possible to construct the orthonormal basis states reflecting an abstract fractal underlying the ground-state subspace, which are permutation-invariant away from quarter filling, but not at quarter filling. As a consequence, there exists a singularity that accounts for the emergence of the saturated flat-band ferromagnetism at quarter filling. We perform a systematic finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy, thus confirming that it scales logarithmically with the block size in the thermodynamic limit, with the prefactor being half the number of type-B Goldstone modes, for the orthonormal basis states at and away from quarter filling.

Abstract: Atomically thin crystals hosting flat electronic bands have been recently identified as a rich playground for exploring and engineering strongly correlated phases. Yet, their variety remains limited, primarily to two-dimensional moir\'e superlattices. Here, we predict the formation of reversible, electrically-induced ultra-flat bands and $\pi$-electron magnetism in one-dimensional chevron graphene nanoribbons. Our $ab$ $initio$ calculations show that the application of a transverse electric field to these nanoribbons generates a pair of isolated, nearly perfectly flat bands with widths of approximately 1 meV around the Fermi level. Upon charge doping, these flat bands undergo a Stoner-like electronic instability, resulting in the spontaneous emergence of local magnetic moments at the edges of the otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbon, akin to a one-dimensional spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain. Our findings expand the class of carbon-based nanostructures exhibiting flat bands and establish a novel route for inducing correlated electronic phases in chevron graphene nanoribbons.

Abstract: Three-dimensional nanoarchitectures are widely used across various areas of physics, including spintronics, photonics, and superconductivity. In this regard, thin curved 3D membranes are especially interesting for applications in nano- and optoelectronics, sensorics, and information processing, making physics simulations in complex 3D geometries indispensable for unveiling new physical phenomena and the development of devices. Here, we present a general-purpose approach to physics simulations for thin curved 3D membranes, that allows for performing simulations using finite difference methods instead of meshless methods or methods with irregular meshes. The approach utilizes a numerical conformal mapping of the initial surface to a flat domain and is based on the uniformization theorem stating that any simply-connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to an open unit disk, a complex plane, or a Riemann sphere. We reveal that for many physical problems involving the Laplace operator and divergence, a flat-domain formulation of the initial problem only requires a modification of the equations of motion and the boundary conditions by including a conformal factor and the mean/Gaussian curvatures. We demonstrate the method's capabilities for case studies of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a charged particle in static electric and magnetic fields for 3D geometries, including C-shaped and ring-shaped structures, as well as for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation.

Abstract: The collective excitations of a multiferroic material are analyzed. We show that these excitations also exhibit magnetoelectric behavior, leading to the hybridization of magnons ,oscillations of the magnetization field, and ferrons, which are oscillations of the electric dipolar density field. We term these emergent entities 'magnetoferrons', study their main properties, and discuss their potential applications. Additionally, we provide a phenomenological framework for these systems, which will be invaluable for describing the dynamics of the multiferromagnetic state.

Abstract: We explore the Mott transition in orthorhombic diamond lattices relevant to (ET)Ag$_4$(CN)$_5$ molecular compounds. The non-interacting phases include nodal line, Dirac and/or Weyl semimetals depending on the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the degree of dimerization of the lattice. Based on an extension of slave-rotor mean-field theory which accounts for magnetic order, we find a transition from a semimetal to a paramagnetic Mott insulator at a critical $U_c$ which becomes N\'eel ordered at a larger Coulomb repulsion, $U_{cm}>U_{c}$. The resulting intermediate Mott phase is a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) consisting on spinon preserving the nodal structure of the nearby semimetallic phases. An analysis of the Green's function in this Mott phase shows how the zeros follow the spinon band dispersions carrying the topology while the poles describe the Hubbard bands. Our results are relevant to recent observations in (ET)Ag$_4$(CN)$_5$ molecular compounds in which the ambient pressure N\'eel ordered Mott insulator is gradually suppressed until semimetallic behavior arises at larger pressures.

Abstract: Many-body ground states of imbalanced Fermi gas have been studied both theoretically and experimentally for several decades because of their fundamental significance in condensed matter physics, cold atom physics and nuclear physics. The Sarma state, a gapless spin-polarized superfluid, is one of those long sought-after exotic ground states of spin imbalanced Fermi gas. Yet, an unambiguous experimental evidence of Sarma superfluid state has not been found. Here, we report the experimental discovery of the Sarma state in atomically thick FeSe films by a dilution-refrigerator scanning tunneling microscope under high magnetic fields. In the bilayer or trilayer FeSe films, we directly observe the key evidence of the entrance of the Sarma state: the inner Zeeman splitting coherence peaks cross the Fermi level under high in-plane magnetic fields. The angle dependent critical in-plane magnetic field of coherence peak crossing shows a two-fold symmetry due to the anisotropy of the in-plane g-factor of FeSe films. Moreover, in a superconducting FeSe monolayer of a lateral size of several hundred nanometers, the Sarma state can also be induced by strong out-of-plane magnetic fields. Our findings pave the way to explore the unusual physical properties and potential applications in superconducting spintronics of the spin-polarized Sarma superfluid state.

Abstract: Material disorders are one of the major sources of noise and loss in solid-state quantum devices, whose behaviors are often modeled as two-level systems (TLSs) formed by charge tunneling between neighboring sites. However, the role of their spins in tunneling and its impact on device performance remain highly unexplored. In this work, employing ultra-thin TiN superconducting resonators, we reveal anomalous TLS behaviors by demonstrating an unexpected increase in resonant frequency at low magnetic fields. Furthermore, a spin-flip TLS model is proposed, in which an effective spin-orbit coupling is generated by inhomogeneous local magnetic fields from defect spins. This mechanism mixes charge tunnelings and spin flips, quantitatively reproducing the observed frequency-field relationship and its temperature dependence. This work deepens the understanding of spin-dependent TLS behaviors, offering the possibility of magnetically engineering noise and loss in solid-state quantum devices.

Abstract: We report on various magnetic configurations including spirals and skyrmions at the surface of the magnetic insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ at low temperatures with a magnetic field applied along <100> using resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS). We observe a well-ordered surface state referred to as a distorted tilted conical spiral (TC) phase over a wide range of magnetic fields. The distorted TC phase shows characteristic higher harmonic magnetic satellites in the REXS reciprocal space maps. Skyrmions emerge following static magnetic field cycling and appear to coexist with the distorted TC phase. Our results indicate that this phase represents a distinct and stable surface state that does not disappear with field cycling and persists until the field strength is increased sufficiently to create the field-polarized state.

Abstract: The electrocaloric effect refers to the temperature change in a material when an electric field is applied or removed. Significant breakthroughs revealed its potential for solid-state cooling technologies in past decades. These devices offer a sustainable alternative to traditional vapor compression refrigeration, with advantages such as compactness, silent operation, and the absence of moving parts or refrigerants.
  Electrocaloric effects are typically studied using indirect methods using polarization data, and which suffer from inaccuracies related to assumptions about heat capacity. Direct methods, although more precise, require device fabrication and face challenges in studying meso- or nanoscale systems, like 2D materials, and materials with non-uniform polarization textures where high spatial resolution is required.
  In this study, a novel technique, Scanning Electrocaloric Thermometry, is introduced for characterizing the local electrocaloric effect in nanomaterials. This approach achieves high spatial resolution by locally applying electric fields and by simultaneously measuring the resulting temperature change. By employing AC excitation, the measurement sensitivity is further enhanced and the electrocaloric effect is disentangled from other heating mechanisms such as Joule heating and dielectric losses. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by examining electrocaloric and heat dissipation phenomena in two-dimensional In${}_2$Se${}_3$ micrometer-sized flakes.

Abstract: In the fabrication of superconducting devices, both in situ and ex situ processes are utilized, making the removal of unwanted oxide layers and impurities under vacuum conditions crucial. Oxygen descumming and argon milling are standard in situ cleaning methods employed for device preparation. We investigated the impact of these techniques on tantalum superconducting thin films using scanning tunneling microscopy at millikelvin temperatures. We demonstrate that these cleaning methods inadvertently introduce magnetic bound states within the superconducting gap of tantalum, likely by oxygen impurities. These bound states can be detrimental to superconducting qubit devices, as they add to dephasing and energy relaxation.

Abstract: Spin glasses are magnetic materials exhibiting numerous magnetization patterns, that randomly vary both in real space and in time. To date, it is still not well understood what the nature of these spatiotemporal dynamics is, namely if they are completely random or if there are links between given time and length scales. Here we show the ubiquitous behavior of dynamic heterogeneity in the self-induced spin glass state of elemental neodymium. We used spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with atomistic spin dynamics simulations to image the locally ordered magnetic patterns in the glass state, and tracked the induced spatiotemporal dynamics in response to external perturbations. We observed that the real space magnetization exhibited a coexistence of slow and fast dynamics reminiscent of dynamic heterogeneity in structural glasses. Furthermore, we found that zero-field cooling imprints a specific set of metastable periodicities into the spin glass, which evolved during aging and could be thermally reinitialized. These results demonstrate the importance of local length scales for the understanding of aging dynamics in spin glasses and provide a link to the more general picture of true glasses.

Abstract: We perform unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations on the 2D Hubbard model on a honeycomb and bilayer honeycomb lattice at both zero and finite temperatures. Finite size real space calculations are supplemented with RPA calculations in the thermodynamic limit. Our motivation comes from high doping levels achieved in graphene and Bernal bilayer graphene by interacalation. We present phase diagrams in doping and temperature for a moderate Hubbard interaction. The magnetic states we find are classified systematically based on the dominant Fourier components of their spin patterns, their average magnetization and spin incommensurabilities. The dominant spin patterns are N\'eel order and various types of stripes. Around Van Hove filling, we resolve the competition between stripe and chiral spin density waves in the symmetry-broken regime. We also investigate the effect of an applied external displacement field on the spin patterns of BBG.

Abstract: In this work, we employed Monte Carlo simulations to study the Ising, $XY$, and Heisenberg models on a simple cubic lattice, where the system models evolve toward the steady state under the influence of competition between one- and two-spin flip dynamics. With probability $q$, the system is in contact with a thermal reservoir at temperature $T$ and evolves toward the lower energy state through one-spin flip dynamics. On the other hand, with probability $1-q$, the system is subjected to an external energy flux that drives it toward the higher energy state through two-spin flip dynamics. As a result, we constructed the phase diagram of $T$ as a function of $q$. In this diagram, we identified the antiferromagnetic ($AF$) ordered phase, the ferromagnetic ($F$) ordered phase, and the disordered paramagnetic ($P$) phase for all the models studied. Through these phases, we observed self-organization phenomena in the systems. For low values of $q$, the system is in the $AF$ phase, and as $q$ increases the system continuously transitions to the $P$ phase. Now, for high values of $q$, the system through continuous phase transitions again reaches an ordered phase, the $F$ phase, at low values of $T$. Additionally, we also calculated the critical exponents of the system, showing that these are not affected by the non-equilibrium regime of the system.

arXiv:2412.15981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions can drive the formation of light (bi)polarons and several novel states of matter. It is, therefore, prudent to develop experimental protocols for identifying such couplings in real materials and quantifying their strength. Here, we investigate how resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) probes e-ph interactions in the one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard-SSH model with onsite phonons. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we compute the full RIXS response and find that the lattice excitations generated during the scattering process inevitably couple to the system's charge and magnetic sectors, resulting in combined multi-particle excitations that cannot be easily disentangled from one another. While this aspect complicates the interpretation of RIXS experiments, we outline how it can be leveraged to identify and quantify SSH-like interactions in quantum materials.

Abstract: Phase transitions are fundamental in nature. A small parameter change near a critical point leads to a qualitative change in system properties. Across a regular phase transition, the system remains in thermal equilibrium and, therefore, experiences a change of static properties, like the emergence of a magnetisation upon cooling a ferromagnet below the Curie temperature. When driving a system far from equilibrium, novel, otherwise inaccessible quantum states of matter may arise. Such states are typically non-Hermitian, that is, their dynamics break time-reversal symmetry, a basic law of equilibrium physics. Phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are of fundamentally new nature in that the dynamical behaviour rather than static properties may undergo a qualitative change at a critical, here called exceptional point. Here we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system. Optical excitation creates charge carriers in the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO. In a temperature-dependent interplay with the Hermitian transition to ferromagnetic order, a non-Hermitian change of the relaxation dynamics occurs, manifesting in our time-resolved reflection data as a transition from bi-exponential real to single-exponential complex decay. Our theory models this behavior and predicts non-Hermitian phase transitions for a large class of condensed-matter systems, where they may be exploited to sensitively control bulk-dynamic properties.

Abstract: Quantum computers require the systematic operation of qubits with high fidelity. For holes in germanium, the spin-orbit interaction allows for \textit{in situ} electric fast and high-fidelity qubit gates. However, the interaction also causes a large qubit variability due to strong g-tensor anisotropy and dependence on the environment. Here, we leverage advances in material growth, device fabrication, and qubit control to realise a two-dimensional 10-spin qubit array, with qubits coupled up to four neighbours that can be controlled with high fidelity. By exploring the large parameter space of gate voltages and quantum dot occupancies, we demonstrate that plunger gate driving in the three-hole occupation enhances electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR), creating a highly localised qubit drive. Our findings, confirmed with analytical and numerical models, highlight the crucial role of intradot Coulomb interaction and magnetic field direction. Furthermore, the ability to engineer qubits for robust control is a key asset for further scaling.

Abstract: Intercalation of two-dimensional (2D) iron chalcogenides with molecular species requires disentangling electronic and structural contributions to understand the puzzling limit to superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) at the frontier of long interlayer separations. Here, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Se K-edge sheds light on the impact of carrier-doping on the local structure of the high-$T_c$ (~39 K) $Li_{1.0}(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$ phase. This material is derived by annealing the structurally related as-made derivative ($T_c$~ 44 K), with layers being primed apart by [alkali-molecule] guests. Metrics, such as, a reduced filling of Se $4p$ orbitals and shorter Fe-Se bonds in the annealed phase, corroborate to a lower electron doping level with respect to the as-made one. Analysis of the metal-ligand thermal motion, based on the correlated Debye model, further relates the higher $T_c$ intercalates with the softening of the local Fe-Se bond. Beyond electronic effects, intercalation brings forth host-guest interactions that mediate the dynamics of the bulk crystal structure. For this, neutron time-of-flight spectroscopy on the annealed derivative, corroborates to the Se-Fe-Se layer being sensitive to chemical pressure effects imposed by the confined organic guests. This reflects in the phonon density of states, where harder low-energy transverse acoustic matrix phonons and molecular vibrations are witnessed, with respect to the pristine inorganic ($\beta$-FeSe) and organic ($C_5D_5N$) counterparts. On cooling through $T_c$, these excitations arrive without a collective magnetic-resonance mode - essential in unconventional, spin-mediated mechanisms - enquiring about deviations from optimal doping. The work highlights that when the Fe-square planes are tuned far apart, carrier-doping leveraged by intercalation plays a key role in the $T_c$ parametrization.

Abstract: Elemental rare-earth metals provide a playground for studying novel electron correlation effects and complex magnetism. However, ab initio simulations of these systems remain challenging. Here, we employ fully charge self-consistent density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) to investigate terbium (Tb) metal under pressure. We show that Tb exhibits a strong band renormalization due to correlation effects, with the calculated electron density of states in good agreement with the experiments. At higher pressures, the correlated electronic structures persist but with modulation in the Hubbard gap, highlighting the tunability of effective Coulomb interactions and kinetic energies. Our DFT+DMFT calculations further indicate a ferromagnetic ground state of Tb at low pressure and low temperature, as well as a transition from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. These ab initio results also align with the experiments. Our study paves the way for exploring heavy lanthanides via advanced first-principles simulations.

Abstract: We present a combined magnetometry, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR), and neutron scattering study of the insulating spin glass Zn$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Te, for which magnetic Mn$^{2+}$ and nonmagnetic Zn$^{2+}$ ions are randomly distributed on a face-centered cubic lattice. Using magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis and reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling of the diffuse magnetic scattering, we show that the spin-glass ground state exhibits short-range type-III antiferromagnetic order with a locally ordered moment of 3.4 $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ between nearest-neighbor spins, which decays as a function of spin separation distance with a correlation length of approximately 5 {\AA}. The diffuse magnetic scattering and corresponding mPDF show no significant changes across the spin-glass freezing temperature $T_f = 22$ K, indicating that the dynamically fluctuating short-range spin correlations in the paramagnetic state retain the same basic type-III configuration that characterizes the spin-glass state; the only change apparent from the neutron scattering data is a gradual reduction of the correlation length and locally ordered moment with increasing temperature. The $\mu$SR results demonstrate that fluctuation rate of the short-range spin correlations decreases gradually and somewhat inhomogeneously through the sample volume as the temperature decreases toward $T_f$. Taken together, these results provide a unique and detailed picture of the local magnetic structure and dynamics in a concentrated spin glass. In addition, this work showcases a new statistical method for extracting diffuse scattering signals from neutron powder diffraction data, which we developed to facilitate the mPDF and RMC analysis of the neutron data. This method has the potential to be broadly useful for neutron powder diffraction experiments on a variety of materials with short-range atomic or magnetic order.

Abstract: Antiferromagnets are promising candidates for ultrafast spintronic applications, leveraging current-induced spin-orbit torques. However, experimentally distinguishing between different switching mechanisms of the staggered magnetization (N\'eel vector) driven by current pulses remains a challenge. In an exemplary study of the collinear antiferromagnetic compound Mn$_2$Au, we demonstrate that slower thermomagnetoelastic effects predominantly govern switching over a wide parameter range. In the regime of short current pulses in the nanosecond range, however, we observe fully N\'eel spin-orbit torque driven switching. We show that this ultrafast mechanism enables the complete directional alignment of the N\'eel vector by current pulses in device structures.

Abstract: SQUID-embedded superconducting resonators are of great interest due to their potential for coupling highly scalable superconducting circuits with quantum memories based on solid-state spin ensembles. Such an application requires a high-$Q$, frequency-tuneable resonator which is both resilient to magnetic field, and able to operate at millikelvin temperatures. These requirements motivate the use of a higher $H_{c}$ metal such as niobium, however the challenge then becomes to sufficiently reduce the operating temperature. We address this by presenting a monolithic Nb nanoSQUID-embedded resonator, where neon focused-ion-beam fabrication of the nanoSQUID results in a device displaying frequency tuneability at $T = 16$ mK. In order to assess the applicability of the device for coupling to small spin clusters, we characterise the flux sensitivity as a function of microwave drive power and externally applied magnetic field, and find that the noise is dominated by dielectric noise in the resonator. Finally, we discuss improvements to the device design which can dramatically improve the flux sensitivity, which highlights the promise of Nb SQUID-embedded resonators for hybrid superconductor-spin applications.

Abstract: Skyrmions having topologically protected field configurations with particle-like properties play an important role in {\bl{various fields of science}}. Our present study focus on the generation of skyrmion from spin spiral in the magnetic multilayers of 4d/Fe/Ir(111) with 4d = Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh. Here we investigate the impact of 4d transition metals on the isotropic Heisenberg exchanges and anti-symmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions originating from the broken inversion symmetry at the interface of 4d/Fe/Ir(111) multilayers. We find a strong exchange frustration due to the hybridization of the Fe-3d layer with both 4d and Ir-5d layers which modifies due to band filling effects of the 4d transition metals. We strengthen the analysis of exchange frustration by shedding light on the orbital decomposition of isotropic exchange interactions of Fe-3d orbitals. Our spin dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the magnetic ground state of 4d/Fe/Ir(111) transition multilayers is a spin spiral in the $ab$-plane with a period of 1 to 2.5 nm generated by magnetic moments of Fe atoms and propagating along the $a$-direction. The spiral wavelengths in Y/Fe/Ir(111) are much larger compared to Rh/Fe/Ir(111). In order to manipulate the skyrmion phase in 4d/Fe/Ir(111), we investigate the magnetic ground state of 4d/Fe/Ir(111) transition multilayers with different external magnetic field. An increasing external magnetic field of $\sim$ 12 T is responsible for deforming the spin spiral into a isolated skyrmion which flips into skyrmion lattice phase around $\sim$ 18 T in Rh/Fe/Ir(111). Our study predict that the stability of magnetic skyrmion phase in Rh/Fe/Ir(111) against thermal fluctuations is upto temperature T $\leq 90$ K.

Abstract: In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect is used to realize topological superconductivity in the topological surface state (TSS) of a 3D topological insulator (TI). In a line Josephson junction made on the TI surface, the spin-momentum locking of the TSS guarantees the existence of a pair of spin-non-degenerate, perfectly transmitted Andreev modes. These modes lead to robust gap closing and parity alteration as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$ across the junction. Here, we report the observation of the predicted gap closing at $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$ in a TI Josephson junction ($n$ integer), where the local density of states is probed via tunnel contacts and $\varphi$ is controlled by a flux loop. This phenomenon is robust for a wide range of chemical potentials, supporting its TSS origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field, Josephson vortices form, making $\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the gap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$, which we also observe. Our results confirm the fundamental role of spin-momentum locking in the Andreev physics in the TSS, which implies that the observed gap closing and reopening has a topological nature.

Abstract: Quantum magnetic materials can provide explicit realizations of paradigm models in quantum many-body physics. In this context, SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ is a faithful realization of the Shastry-Sutherland model (SSM) for ideally frustrated spin dimers, even displaying several of its quantum magnetic phases as a function of pressure. We perform inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ at 5.5 GPa and 4.5 K, observing spin waves that characterize the high-pressure antiferromagnetic phase. The experimental spectra are well described by linear spin-wave calculations on a SSM with an inter-layer interaction, which is determined accurately as $J_c = 0.053(3)$ meV. The presence of $J_c$ indicates the need to account for the three-dimensional nature of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ in theoretical models, also at lower pressures. We find that the ratio between in-plane interactions, $J'/J = 1.8(2)$, undergoes a dramatic change compared to lower pressures that we deduce is driven by a sharp drop in the dimer coupling, $J$. Our results underline the wide horizons opened by high-pressure INS experiments on quantum magnetic materials.

Abstract: We study the electronic structure of Ta2NiSe5 in its low-temperature semiconducting phase, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ta L3 edge. We also investigate the electronic properties of Ta2NiSe5 within the density-functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. While ARPES, dc transport, and optical measurements indicate that Ta2NiSe5 is a small band-gap semiconductor, DFT gives a metallic nonmagnetic solution in Ta2NiSe5 . To obtain the semiconducting ground state in Ta2 NiSe5 we use a self-interaction correction (SIC) procedure by introducing an orbital-dependent potential Vl into the Hamiltonian. We investigate theoretically the x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and RIXS spectra at the Ni and Ta L3 edges and analyze the spectra in terms of interband transitions. We investigate the RIXS spectra as a function of momentum transfer vector Q and incident photon energy. Because Ta2 NiSe5 possesses only fully occupied (Ni 3d and Se 4p) and completely empty (Ta 5d) shells with the formal valencies Ta5+ (5d0), Ni0 (3d10 ), and Se2- (4p6 ), both the Ni and Ta L3 RIXS spectra belong to a charge transfer type with ligand-to-metal excitations.

Abstract: We present a bosonized effective field theory for a 2d Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field using the coadjoint orbit approach, which was recently developed as a nonlinear bosonization method in phase space for Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids. We show that by parametrizing the phase space with the guiding center and the mechanical momentum, and by using techniques in noncommutative field theory, the physics of Landau levels and Landau level degeneracy ($N_{\Phi}$) naturally arises. For a parabolic dispersion, the resulting theory describes $N_{\Phi}$ flavors of free chiral bosons propagating in \emph{momentum space}. In addition, the action contains a linear term in the bosonic field, which upon mode expansion becomes a topological $\theta$-term. By properly quantizing this theory, we reproduce the well-known thermal and magnetic responses of a Fermi surface, including linear-in-$T$ specific heat, Landau diamagnetism, and the de Haas-van Alphen effect. {In particular, the de Haas-van Alphen effect is shown to be a direct consequence of the topological $\theta$-term.} Our theory paves the way toward understanding correlated gapless fermionic systems in a magnetic field using the powerful approach of bosonization.

Abstract: The competition between the Kondo spin-screening effect and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in heavy-fermion systems drives the quantum phase transition between the magnetically ordered and the heavy-Fermi-liquid ground states. Despite intensive investigations of heavy quasiparticles on the Kondo-screened side of the quantum phase transition and of their breakdown at the quantum critical point, the magnetically ordering side has not systematically been studied. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we report a suppression of the Kondo quasiparticle weight in CeCu$_{6-x}$Au$_x$ samples on the antiferromagnetic side of the quantum phase transition at temperatures as much as two orders of magnitude above the N\'{e}el temperature $T_\text{N}$. With our systematic investigations into the high-temperature, paramagnetic region on the antiferromagnetic side of the phase diagram of CeCu$_{6-x}$Au$_x$, i.e., with $x =$ 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5, we show that the suppression results from a quantum frustration effect induced by the temperature-independent RKKY interaction. Hence, our results emphasize that besides critical fluctuations, the RKKY interaction may play an important role in the quantum-critical scenario.

Abstract: Disordered iron germanium (FeGe) has recently garnered interest as a testbed for a variety of magnetic phenomena as well as for use in magnetic memory and logic applications. This is partially owing to its ability to host skyrmions and antiskyrmions -- nanoscale whirlpools of magnetic moments that could serve as information carriers in spintronic devices. In particular, a tunable skyrmion-antiskyrmion system may be created through precise control of the defect landscape in B20-phase FeGe, motivating developing methods to systematically tune disorder in this material and understand the ensuing structural properties. To this end, we investigate a route for modifying magnetic properties in FeGe. Specifically, we irradiate epitaxial B20-phase FeGe films with 2.8 MeV Au$^{4+}$ ions, which creates a dispersion of amorphized regions that may preferentially host antiskyrmions at densities controlled by the irradiation fluence. To further tune the disorder landscape, we conduct a systematic electron diffraction study with in-situ annealing, demonstrating the ability to recrystallize controllable fractions of the material at temperatures ranging from approximately 150$^{\circ}$ C to 250$^{\circ}$C. Finally, we describe the crystallization kinetics using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model, finding that the growth of crystalline grains is consistent with diffusion-controlled one-to-two dimensional growth with a decreasing nucleation rate.

Abstract: Nuclear magnetism underpins areas such as medicine in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hyperpolarization of nuclei enhances the quantity and quality of information that can be determined from these techniques by increasing their signal to noise ratios by orders of magnitude. However, some of these hyperpolarization techniques rely on the use of low to ultralow magnetic fields (ULF) (nTs-mTs). The broadband character and ultrasensitive field sensitivity of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) allow for probing nuclear magnetism at these fields, where other magnetometers, such as Faraday coils and flux gates do not. To this end, we designed a reactor to hyperpolarize [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate with the technique, signal amplification by reversible exchange in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH). Hyperpolarized pyruvate has been shown to be very powerful for the diagnosis of tumours with MRI as its metabolism is associated with various pathologies. We were able to characterize the field sensitivity of our setup by simulating the filled reactor in relation to its placement in our ultralow noise, ULF MRI setup. Using the simulations, we determined that our hyperpolarization setup results in a $^{13}$C polarization of 0.4 %, a signal enhancement of $\sim$100~000~000 versus the predicted thermal equilibrium signal at earth field ($\sim$50 $\mu$T). This results in a $^{13}$C signal of 6.20$\pm$0.34~pT, which with our ultralow noise setup, opens the possibility for direct observation of the hyperpolarization and the subsequent spin-lattice relaxation without system perturbation.

Abstract: The construction of coarse-grained descriptions of a system's kinetics is well established in biophysics. One prominent example is Markov state models in protein folding dynamics. In this paper, we develop a coarse-grained, discrete state model of a self-aggregating colloidal particle system inspired by the concepts of Markov state modelling. The specific self-aggregating system studied here involves field-responsive colloidal particles in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. Starting from particle-resolved (Brownian dynamics) simulations, we define the discrete states by categorizing each particle according to it's local structure. We then describe the kinetics between these states as a series of stochastic, memoryless jumps. In contrast to other works on colloidal self-assembly, our coarse-grained approach describes the simultaneous formation and evolution of multiple aggregates from single particles. Our discrete model also takes into account the changes in transition dynamics between the discrete states as the size of the largest cluster grows. We validate the coarse-grained model by comparing the predicted population fraction in each of the discrete states with those calculated directly from the particle-resolved simulations as a function of the largest cluster size. We then predict population fractions in presence of noise-averaging and in a situation where a model parameter is changed instantaneously after a certain time. Finally, we explore the validity of the detailed balance condition in the various stages of aggregation.

Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits two prominent correlated phenomena in distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a two-dimensional spin helix phase emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity in the scaling dimensions of various operators, accessible by adjusting the interaction strength between electrons. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids.

Abstract: Magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators has been a field of much interest, while condensation in anti-ferromagnetic systems are yet to be explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: an easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type DMI interaction supports two condensate populations at finite wavevectors. The condensation state is stable only when the distribution of magnons between the two populations is symmetric. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without DMI interaction we predict that the magnons condensate will not be stabilized. The results indicate that the lack of stability is a general feature of single-component quasiparticle condensates.

Abstract: We show that ferromagnetic interactions can enhance the adiabatic performance of a quantum spin chain engine at low temperatures. The enhancement in work output is particular pronounced, increasing exponentially with interaction strength. The performance enhancement occurs in the paramagnetic phase and is qualitatively explained by considering just the ground and first excited state, in which case the system exhibits bipartite entanglement. As the temperature is increased, thermal occupation of higher energy states diminishes performance. We find that these thermal fluctuations are smallest for long-range interactions, resulting in the highest efficiency. Diabatic work extraction degrades performance due to quantum friction. We identify an approximate, experimentally realisable counterdiabatic drive that can mitigate friction for weak interactions.

Abstract: An analytical study of second harmonic generation due to the interaction of radially polarized laser beam with homogeneous and unmagnetized plasma is presented. The analytical study is based on Lorentz force, continuity and electromagnetic wave equations. Amplitude of second harmonic radiation is derived with the help of current density and dispersion relation obtained at twice the fundamental frequency of the laser field. Perturbation technique is used for evaluation of current density. The variation of amplitude and efficiency of radially polarized second harmonic radiation with propagation distance is graphically depicted. It is seen that radially polarized laser propagating in plasma gives efficient second harmonic radiation generation.

Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport characteristics of boron-doped diamond (BDD) across frequencies ranging from direct current to 3 GHz to explore the potential of BDD circuits as microwave waveguides. Three homoepitaxial BDD films with varying boron concentrations, exhibiting insulating to metallic properties, are fabricated on a single-crystalline diamond substrate containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. The $\Omega$-shaped BDD circuit demonstrates an approximately 30 $\Omega$ impedance at the resonance frequency of the NV center, facilitating the propagation of microwaves over the circuit, even with a standard 50 $\Omega$ reference impedance. We successfully perform optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on NV centers within diamonds using BDD circuits and observed continuous-wave ODMR spectra across all circuits. Additionally, we record Rabi oscillations in pulsed ODMR measurements using the metallic BDD circuit. The integration of NV centers with BDDs presents a compact, robust, and adaptable platform for quantum sensing in challenging environments and for quantum information processing.

Abstract: A low pressure discharge sustained in molecular hydrogen with help of the electron cyclotron resonance heating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz is simulated using a fully electromagnetic implicit charge- and energy-conserving particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo code. The simulations show a number of kinetic effects, and the results are in good agreement with various experimentally measured data such as electron density, electron temperature and degree of dissociation. The electron energy distribution shows a tri-Maxwellian form due to a number of different electron heating mechanisms, agreeing with the experimental data in the measured electron energy interval. The simulation results are also verified against a drift-diffusion model and proximity is observed between the computational results for the plasma density at the location of experimental measurement. However, the fluid approximation fails to accurately predict radical density and electron temperature because of the assumption of a single electron temperature. Special attention is paid to the characteristics of hydrogen radicals, whose production is strongly underestimated by the fluid model, whereas it is well predicted by the model considered here. The energy distribution of such radicals demonstrates the presence of a relatively large number of energetic hydrogen atoms produced by the dissociation of molecular hydrogen. The new insights are of significance for practical applications of hydrogen plasmas.

Abstract: We detail here a semi-analytical model for the pellet rocket effect, which describes the acceleration of pellets in a fusion plasma due to asymmetries in the heat flux reaching the pellet surface and the corresponding ablation rate. This effect was shown in experiments to significantly modify the pellet trajectory, and projections for reactor scale devices indicate that it may severely limit the effectiveness of pellet injection methods. We account for asymmetries stemming both from plasma parameter gradients and an asymmetric plasmoid shielding caused by the drift of the ionized pellet cloud. For high temperature, reactor relevant scenarios, we find a wide range of initial pellet sizes and speeds where the rocket effect severely limits the penetration depth of the pellet. In these cases, the plasma parameter profile variations dominate the rocket effect. We find that for small and fast pellets, where the rocket effect is less pronounced, plasmoid shielding induced asymmetries dominate.

Abstract: Antiferromagnets are promising candidates for ultrafast spintronic applications, leveraging current-induced spin-orbit torques. However, experimentally distinguishing between different switching mechanisms of the staggered magnetization (N\'eel vector) driven by current pulses remains a challenge. In an exemplary study of the collinear antiferromagnetic compound Mn$_2$Au, we demonstrate that slower thermomagnetoelastic effects predominantly govern switching over a wide parameter range. In the regime of short current pulses in the nanosecond range, however, we observe fully N\'eel spin-orbit torque driven switching. We show that this ultrafast mechanism enables the complete directional alignment of the N\'eel vector by current pulses in device structures.

Abstract: For magnonics and spintronics applications, the spin polarization ($P$) of a transport current and the magnetic damping ($\alpha$) play a crucial role, e.g. for magnetization dynamics and magnetization switching applications. In particular, $P$ in a glassy (amorphous) 3d transition ferromagnet such as CoFeB and $\alpha$ are both strongly affected by $s-d$ scattering mechanisms. Hence, a correlation can be expected which is a priori difficult to predict. In this work, $P$ and $\alpha$ are measured using current-induced Doppler shifts using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy and broadband ferromagnetic resonance techniques in blanket films and current-carrying $Co_{\rm x}Fe_{\rm {80-x}}B_{\rm 20}$ alloy microstrips. The measured $P$ ranges from 0.18 $\pm$ 0.05 to 0.39 $\pm$ 0.05 and $\alpha$ ranges from $(4.0\pm 0.2)\cdot10^{-3}$ to $(9.7\pm 0.6)\cdot10^{-3}$. We find that for increasing $P$ a systematic drop in $\alpha$ is observed, indicating an interplay between magnetic damping and the spin polarization of the transport current which suggests that interband scattering dominates in $Co_{\rm x}Fe_{\rm {80-x}}B_{\rm 20}$. Our results may guide future experiments, theory, and applications in advancing spintronics and metal magnonics.

Abstract: Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are discrete electromagnetic emissions separated by multiple ion gyrofrequencies. Harmonic EMIC waves are defined as waves with a strong electric or magnetic field (or both) at the harmonics of the fundamental EMIC mode. In this paper, for the first time, we present a statistical study on harmonic EMIC waves by the Van Allen Probes. The EMIC waves are categorized into three types based on their harmonics: (1) fundamental mode only (without higher harmonics), (2) electrostatic (ES) harmonics, and (3) electromagnetic (EM) harmonics. Our statistical study shows that ES and EM harmonic EMIC waves predominantly occur on the dayside, outside the plasmasphere with $L >5$ and are associated with a low $f_{pe}/f_{ce}$, a high proton $\beta_H$, and a strong fundamental EMIC mode. The results will advance our understanding of harmonic EMIC waves and their generation mechanisms.

Abstract: Three-dimensional nanoarchitectures are widely used across various areas of physics, including spintronics, photonics, and superconductivity. In this regard, thin curved 3D membranes are especially interesting for applications in nano- and optoelectronics, sensorics, and information processing, making physics simulations in complex 3D geometries indispensable for unveiling new physical phenomena and the development of devices. Here, we present a general-purpose approach to physics simulations for thin curved 3D membranes, that allows for performing simulations using finite difference methods instead of meshless methods or methods with irregular meshes. The approach utilizes a numerical conformal mapping of the initial surface to a flat domain and is based on the uniformization theorem stating that any simply-connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to an open unit disk, a complex plane, or a Riemann sphere. We reveal that for many physical problems involving the Laplace operator and divergence, a flat-domain formulation of the initial problem only requires a modification of the equations of motion and the boundary conditions by including a conformal factor and the mean/Gaussian curvatures. We demonstrate the method's capabilities for case studies of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a charged particle in static electric and magnetic fields for 3D geometries, including C-shaped and ring-shaped structures, as well as for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation.

Abstract: Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) discovery of the prevalence of switchbacks (SBs), localised magnetic deflections in the nascent solar wind, has sparked interest in uncovering their origins. A prominent theory suggests these SBs originate in the lower corona through magnetic reconnection processes, closely linked to solar jet phenomena. Jets are impulsive events, observed across scales and solar atmosphere layers, associated with the release of magnetic twist and helicity. This study examines whether self-consistent jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfv\'enic wind, assesses the impact of distinct Parker solar wind profiles on jet dynamics, and determines if jet-induced magnetic untwisting waves display signatures typical of SBs. We employed parametric 3D numerical MHD simulations using the ARMS code to model the self-consistent generation of solar jets. Our study focuses on the propagation of solar jets in distinct atmospheric plasma $\beta$ and Alfv\'en velocity profiles, including a Parker solar wind. Our findings show that self-consistent coronal jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfv\'enic wind. Notable structures such as the leading Alfv\'enic wave and trailing dense-jet region were consistently observed across diverse plasma $\beta$ atmospheres. The jet propagation dynamics are significantly influenced by atmospheric variations, with changes in Alfv\'en velocity profiles affecting the group velocity and propagation ratio of the leading and trailing structures. U-loops, prevalent at jet onset, do not persist in the low-$\beta$ corona, but magnetic untwisting waves associated with jets show SB-like signatures. However, full-reversal SBs were not observed. These findings may explain the absence of full reversal SBs in the sub-Alfv\'enic wind and illustrate the propagation of magnetic deflections through jet-like events, shedding light on possible SB formation processes.

Abstract: The generation of robust entanglement in quantum system arrays is a crucial aspect of the realization of efficient quantum information processing. Recently, the field of quantum magnonics has garnered significant attention as a promising platform for advancing in this direction. In our proposed scheme, we utilize a one-dimensional array of coupled cavities, with each cavity housing a single yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to the cavity mode through magnetic dipole interaction. To induce entanglement between YIGs, we employ a local squeezed reservoir, which provides the necessary nonlinearity for entanglement generation. Our results demonstrate the successful generation of bipartite and tripartite entanglement between distant magnon modes, all achieved through a single quantum reservoir. Furthermore, the steady-state entanglement between magnon modes is robust against magnon dissipation rates and environment temperature. Our results may lead to applications of cavity-magnon arrays in quantum information processing and quantum communication systems.

Abstract: Manipulating external stimuli is crucial for enhancing and controlling the optical response in chiral structures. This study introduces chiral structures composed of single, dimer, or trimer arrays of plasmonic and magneto-plasmonic trapezoidal and triangular nanoantennas. Through modeling, we demonstrate how these systems can (i) function as chiral metasurfaces, (ii) modulate chiral light absorption via an external magnetic field, (iii) magnetically enhance the chiro-optical response, and (iv) improve the chiro-optical and magneto-chiral response through structural engineering. By optimizing the nanoantenna geometry, we achieve enhancements larger than 100 in the chiro-optical signal of a magnetized Ni monomer compared to a non-magnetized system. Additionally, we model bimetallic systems, showing a ~2-fold increase in chiro-optical response for hybrid Au and Ni magneto-plasmonic systems compared to purely plasmonic Au systems, while simultaneously enabling magnetic tuning of the optical response. Our results highlight the potential of structurally engineered magneto-plasmonic nanoantennas for advanced applications in chiro-optical sensing and tunable photonic devices.

Abstract: Using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Magnetometer observations, we report the first statistical study of ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves at the Martian foreshock. The analyzed foreshock ULF wave events are observed in the 0.008-0.086 Hz frequency range, with nearly circular and elliptical left-handed polarization in the spacecraft reference frame. These waves are propagated quasi-parallel to the ambient magnetic field, with a moderate wave amplitude. All these properties are consistent with fast magnetosonic waves, most likely generated through the ion-ion right-hand resonant instability. In addition, our results suggest that the associated resonant backstreaming protons' velocities parallel to the mean magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame is $1.33 \pm 0.40$ times the solar wind velocity. The similarity between our results and previous reports at other foreshocks may indicate the presence of a common acceleration process acting in planetary bow shocks and that is responsible for this particular backstreaming population.

Abstract: The design of divertor targets and baffles for optimal heat and particle exhaust from magnetically confined fusion plasmas requires a combination of fast, low-fidelity models (such as EMC3-lite [1]) for scoping studies and high-fidelity ones (such as EMC3-EIRENE [2]) for verification. Both of those approaches benefit from a magnetic flux tube mesh for fast interpolation and mapping of field line segments [3]. A new mesh generator for unstructured quadrilateral flux tubes with adaptive refinement is presented and integrated into FLARE [4]. For HSX with an extended first wall, it is found that several layers of flux tubes can span the entire half field period before splitting is required. This is an advantage over the traditional setup of the EMC3-EIRENE mesh where careful construction of several sub-domains is required already for the much tighter present first wall. The divide and conquer paradigm with unstructured mesh layout offers a powerful alternative for integration into optimization workflows. Further examples for W7-X and CTH are presented.

Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfv\'en pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. The electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfv\'en wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e., accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined on the basis of the perturbation theory and specified to the case of a magnetic flux tube homogeneous over its cross section. For the chromospheric tubes, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decrease, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.

# Programmable Metal Arrangements in Metal-Organic Polyhedra and Frameworks

**Authors:** Nils, Nöthling

The preparation of regioisomers of small molecules is routine, but an analogous concept of positional isomerism is absent for extended materials. Crystalline frameworks such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can furnish well-defined active sites for heterogeneous catalysis, but their arrangement cannot be tuned in isolation. Here we show that a mobility-tuned synthesis approach permits selective synthesis of multiple different “structomers”, which are isostructural and compositionally identical but which feature different metal arrangements. High-fidelity access to each targeted metal arrangement was confirmed by operationally facile electron paramagnetic resonance analysis and validated by mass spectrometry. The performance of Rh centers in propene hydrogenation catalysis differs substantially for different metal arrangements within the framework, even though all Rh centers have identical primary coordination environments. For properties that depend on metal distances, structomer-selective synthesis thus presents a new paradigm for fundamental study and performance optimization.

# Heteronuclear Parahydrogen-Induced Hyperpolarization via Side Arm Hydrogenation

## 异核对氢通过侧臂氢化引起的超极化

**Authors:** Igor V., Koptyug

Nuclear spin hyperpolarization dramatically enhances the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. Hyperpolarization of biomolecules (e.g., pyruvate) is of particular interest as it allows one to follow their metabolism, providing a diagnostic tool for various pathologies, including cancer. In this regard, the hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei is especially beneficial due to its relatively long hyperpolarization lifetime and the absence of a background signal. Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) is arguably the most affordable hyperpolarization technique. PHIP exploits the pairwise addition of parahydrogen to an unsaturated substrate. This sets limitations on the range of compounds amenable to direct PHIP hyperpolarization. The range of molecules that can be hyperpolarized with PHIP significantly expanded in 2015 when PHIP by means of side arm hydrogenation (PHIP-SAH) was introduced. Here, parahydrogen is added to an unsaturated alcoholic moiety of an ester followed by polarization transfer to carboxylate 13C nuclei with a subsequent cleavage of the side arm. In this review, the recent advances in PHIP-SAH are discussed, including the synthetic methodology to produce isotopically labeled precursors, peculiarities of pairwise addition of parahydrogen to PHIP-SAH precursors, polarization transfer, cleavage of the side arm, purification of hyperpolarized solution, and, finally, in vitro and in vivo applications.

# Nanocellulose Chiral Synergistic Effect Enhances Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Lanthanide Electric Dipole Transition Bands

## 纳米纤维素手性协同效应增强镧系电偶极过渡带的圆偏振发光

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5157822/latest

The circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of Eu(III) ion has been highly valued due to their high asymmetry factor and characteristic luminescence. However, the most reported CPL of Eu3+ ion is contributed from the magnetic dipole transitions but very less from the electric dipole transitions due to the influence of coordination fields. Until now, the amplification of the asymmetry factor (glum) of CPL is mainly due to magnetic dipole transition glum (glum&amp;minus;mag), while electric dipole transition glum (glum&amp;minus;ele) has almost no amplification. In this study, nanocellulose chiral films were synergistically induced with chiral &beta;-diketones Eu-TFC (D/L) and hybrid photonic crystal films CNC@Eu-TFC (D/L) targeted methods for achieving electric dipole transition CPL and glum&amp;minus;ele of Eu3+ ions. The glum&amp;minus;ele was higher than glum&amp;minus;mag, achieving a reversal of glum&amp;minus;ele and glum&amp;minus;mag sizes. The glum of CNC@Eu-TFC (L) was relatively higher than that of CNC@Eu-TFC (D), the main reason for which was that the macroscopic chirality of the nanocellulose film, with a left-handed spiral structure, had a stronger synergistic induction effect with left-handed Eu-TFC (L). Therefore, utilizing the macroscopic chirality of CNC films could effectively amplify the difficulty to activate glum&amp;minus;ele of Eu3+ ions, providing a new approach for its preparation in high-performance CPL materials.

# Development and Evaluation of a Training Program for Implementation of Velopharyngeal MRI in the Clinical Setting

## 开发和评估在临床环境中实施腭咽MRI的培训计划

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5039983/latest

Background: Many craniofacial teams are interested in using velopharyngeal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clinically for surgical planning for management of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). However, many teams report training and resources are barriers that prevent them from implementing MRI.
Objective: (1) To describe a training program for implementation of velopharyngeal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the clinical setting, (2) to assess the effectiveness of the training program, and (3) to identify factors associated with successful implementation of velopharyngeal MRI.
Materials and methods: Eleven metropolitan-based hospitals with craniofacial clinics participated in a prospective observational study. From these 11 hospitals, 53 patients with VPI completed a velopharyngeal MRI. A training program was created and modified while launching velopharyngeal MRI at each hospital. The main outcome measures were: (1) Overall success rate of velopharyngeal MRI, (2) number of MRIs to achieve competence, and (3) success rate with velopharyngeal MRI after achieving competence.
Results: Key components of the training program included: delivery of MRI scan parameters; roundtable discussion of process for patient preparation and scan execution; test MRI scans; feedback from velopharyngeal MRI experts; and availability of brief references to review immediately before the MRI. 10 of the 11 hospitals achieved competence. The overall success rate was 81%, which improved to 89% after hospitals achieved competence. It took hospitals an average of 1.5 MRI scans to achieve competence (range: 1-3 MRI scans). Factors associated with successful implementation of velopharyngeal MRI were having a speech-language pathologist present for the MRI, having consistent MRI staff, and having previous experience with velopharyngeal MRI.
Conclusions: The training program led to successful implementation of velopharyngeal MRI. Hospitals benefited from having resources that were friendly to use during real-time data collection. The use of consistent MRI staff and/or a speech-language pathologist present during the MRI may improve velopharyngeal MRI scan success.

# An Optimization Protocol for MRI Examination Resource Allocation Based on Demand Forecasting and Linear Programming

## 基于需求预测和线性规划的MRI检查资源配置优化方案

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5598439/latest

Objective: The accessibility of medical services in Mainland China had been on the rise, leading to a surge in the number of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. This increase had caused substantial delays in MRI examination queues at large hospitals. With MRI equipment and exams being costly, over-purchasing machines could lead to underutilization of resources. It was, therefore, crucial to devise a comprehensive method that could shorten patient wait times and optimize the use of medical resources within hospitals.
Method: The research had utilized daily MRI examination application data from a hospital covering the period from July 1, 2017, to November 30, 2022. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous (ARIMAX) model were developed using SAS (version 9.3) software. Moreover, Non-AutoRegressive (NAR) and Non-AutoRegressive with exogenous (NARX) models were built using MATLAB (version R2015b) to forecast future MRI examination demands. The predictive accuracy of these models was then assessed and compared. Based on the prediction outcomes, an Integer Linear Programming model was employed to calculate the optimal number of MRI examinations per machine per day, targeting cost reduction. An optimization flowchart for MRI examination resource allocation was developed by integrating critical process components, thus streamlining and systematizing the optimization process to improve efficiency.
Results: Analysis of the data revealed a weekly cyclical trend in MRI examination applications. Among the ARIMA, ARIMAX, NAR, and NARX models evaluated for their predictive skills, the NARX model emerged as the most accurate for forecasting. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model was utilized to plan the number of examinations for each MRI machine, effectively reducing costs. An optimization flowchart was developed to integrate key factors in MRI examination resource allocation, streamlining and systematizing the optimization process to enhance work efficiency.
Conclusion: This study offers a comprehensive protocol for optimizing MRI examination resource allocation, combining the predictive power of the NARX model, the planning capabilities of the Integer Linear Programming model, and the integration of other relevant factors via an optimization flowchart.
Clinical trial number: &amp;nbsp;not applicable.
