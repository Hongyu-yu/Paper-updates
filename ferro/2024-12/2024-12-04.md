Author(s): Cecile A. Skoryna-Kline, Jorge Monroy-Ruz, and Krishna C. Balram<br /><p>Piezoelectric devices are traditionally analyzed in the quasistatic regime with the magnetic fields ignored. However, the surface magnetic fields can be significant at GHz frequencies and provide a natural interface to nanoscale spin systems. The authors show via scaling arguments that the surface magnetic field scales with the square of the operation frequency, and demonstrate its existence in a proof-of-concept experiment by showing excess absorption of a focused surface acoustic wave induced by magnon mode. This approach leads to enhanced spin detection sensitivity of piezoelectric devices, and also indicates the feasibility of single-spin electrical readout at cryogenic temperatures.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRAPPLIED/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.22.064019.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

# Paired autoencoders for likelihood-free estimation in inverse problems

## 用于反问题中无似然估计的成对自动编码器

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad95dd

We consider the solution of nonlinear inverse problems where the forward problem is a discretization of a partial differential equation. Such problems are notoriously difficult to solve in practice and require minimizing a combination of a data-fit term and a regularization term. The main computational bottleneck of typical algorithms is the direct estimation of the data misfit. Therefore, likelihood-free approaches have become appealing alternatives. Nonetheless, difficulties in generalization and limitations in accuracy have hindered their broader utility and applicability. In this work, we use a paired autoencoder framework as a likelihood-free estimator (LFE) for inverse problems. We show that the use of such an architecture allows us to construct a solution efficiently and to overcome some known open problems when using LFEs. In particular, our framework can assess the quality of the solution and improve on it if needed. We demonstrate the viability of our approach using examples from full waveform inversion and inverse electromagnetic imaging.

# Terahertz stimulated parametric downconversion of a magnon mode in an antiferromagnet

arXiv:2412.01989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In condensed matter systems, interactions between collective modes offer avenues for nonlinear coherent manipulation of coupled excitations and quantum phases. Antiferromagnets, with their inherently coupled magnon modes, provide a promising platform for nonlinear control of microscopic spin waves and macroscopic magnetization. However, nonlinear magnon-magnon interactions have been only partially elaborated, leaving key gaps in the prospects for potential ultrahigh-bandwidth magnonic signal processing. Here, we use a pair of intense terahertz pulses to sequentially excite two distinct coherent magnon modes in an antiferromagnet and find that the magnon mode with a lower frequency undergoes amplification when the higher-frequency mode is driven. We unveil the nonlinear excitation pathways of this stimulated parametric downconversion process by using polarization-selective two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy. Our work provides fundamental insights into nonlinear magnonics in antiferromagnets, laying the groundwork for forthcoming spintronic and magnonic devices based on nonlinear magnon-magnon interactions.

# Energy level structure of diamond silicon vacancy centers in an off-axis magnetic field

## 离轴磁场中金刚石硅空位中心的能级结构

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02005

arXiv:2412.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of an experimental approach that can characterize the energy level structure of an individual silicon vacancy (SiV) center in a magnetic field and extract the key parameters for the energy level structure. This approach builds upon a theoretical model that includes effects of the static strain, dynamic Jahn-Teller coupling, and magnetic field and introduces two coupling rates, one each for the ground and the excited states, to characterize the combined effects of strain and Jahn-Teller coupling. With the use of an analytical expression for the energy level structure of the SiV center under a transverse magnetic field, these two coupling rates can be directly derived from the measurement of the frequency separation between two spin-conserved transitions in a photoluminescence excitation spectrum and the measurement of the coherent population trapping resonance related to the SiV ground spin states. Additional experimental studies on the dependence of the energy level structure on the magnetic field amplitude and direction further verify the theoretical model and reveal contributions from unequal orbital magnetic coupling for the ground and excited states.

arXiv:2412.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a topological metal where ferromagnetic Tb ions with strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy interact with V kagome layers. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements show that the Tb ions adopt an Ising doublet ground state. Here, we consider whether a transverse magnetic field can drive TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ towards a quantum critical point, providing a rare example of transverse-field Ising criticality in a metallic compound. High-field magnetization measurements suggest that this quantum criticality is avoided and reveal a first-order-like spin-reorientation transition at 25.6 T due to an excited-state level crossing. Theoretical analysis shows that small changes in the local Hamiltonian can restore the quantum criticality for some in-plane field directions, suggesting that TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is close to a novel quantum tricritical point induced by in-plane magnetic anisotropy.

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02067

arXiv:2412.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) have strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and could be used to build spin filters by utilising transverse magnetic focusing (TMF). However, with an increase in the spin degree of freedom, holes demonstrate significantly different behaviour to electrons in TMF experiments, making it difficult to interpret the results of these experiments. In this paper, we numerically model TMF in a 2DHG within a GaAs/Al$_{\mathrm{x}}$Ga$_{\mathrm{1-x}}$As heterostructure. Our band structure calculations show that the heavy $(\langle J_{z} \rangle = \pm\frac{3}{2})$ and light $(\langle J_{z} \rangle = \pm\frac{1}{2})$ hole states in the valence band mix at finite $k$, and the heavy hole subbands which are spin-split due to the Rashba effect are not spin-polarised. This lack of spin polarisation casts doubt on the viability of spin filtering using TMF in 2DHGs within conventional GaAs/Al$_{\mathrm{x}}$Ga$_{\mathrm{1-x}}$As heterostructures. We then calculate transport properties of the 2DHG with spin projection and offer a new perspective on interpreting and designing TMF experiments in 2DHGs.

# Sublayers Editing of Covalent MAX Phase for Nanolaminated Early Transition Metal Compounds

## 纳米层状早期过渡金属化合物共价MAX相的子层编辑

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02157

arXiv:2412.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have gained popularity in fields such as energy storage, catalysis, and electromagnetic interference due to their diverse elemental compositions and variable surface terminations (T). Generally, the synthesis of MXene materials involves etching the weak M-A metallic bonds in the ternary layered transition metal carbides and nitrides (MAX phase) using HF acid or Lewis acid molten salts, while the strong M-X covalent bonds preserve the two-dimensional framework structure of MXenes. On the other hand, the MAX phase material family also includes a significant class of members where the A site is occupied by non-metal main group elements (such as sulfur and phosphorus), in which both M-A and M-X are covalent bond-type sublayers. The aforementioned etching methods cannot be used to synthesize MXene materials from these parent phases. In this work, we discovered that the covalent bond-type M-A and M-X sublayers exhibit different reactivity with some inorganic materials in a high-temperature molten state. By utilizing this difference in reactivity, we can structurally modify these covalent sublayers, allowing for the substitution of elements at the X site (from B to Se, S, P, C) and converting non-metal A site atoms in non-van der Waals (non-vdW) MAX phases into surface atoms in vdW layered materials. This results in a family of early transition metal Xide chalcogenides (TMXCs) that exhibit lattice characteristics of both MXenes and transition metal chalcogenides. Using electron-donor chemical scissors, these TMXC layered materials can be further exfoliated into monolayer nanosheets. The atomic configurations of each atom in these monolayer TMXCs are the same as those of conventional MXenes, but the oxidation states of the M-site atoms can be regulated by both X-site atoms and intercalated cations.

Abstract: We report Ni-doping effect on the magnetic and electronic properties of thiospinel Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$[Co$_{0.3}$Ir$_{1.7}$]S$_4$ (0 $\leq x \leq$ 1). The parent compound Co[Co$_{0.3}$Ir$_{1.7}$]S$_4$ exhibits antiferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{N} \sim$ 292 K within the $A$-site diamond sublattice, along with a narrow charge-transfer gap. Upon Ni doping, an insulator-to-metal crossover occurs at $x \sim$ 0.35, and the antiferromagnetism is gradually suppressed, with $T_\mathrm{N}$ decreasing to 23 K at $x =$ 0.7. In the metallic state, a spin-glass-like transition emerges at low temperatures. The antiferromagnetic transition is completely suppressed at $x_\mathrm{c} \sim$ 0.95, around which a non-Fermi-liquid behavior emerges, evident from the $T^\alpha$ temperature dependence with $\alpha \approx$ 1.2-1.3 in resistivity and divergent behavior of $C/T$ in specific heat at low temperatures. Meanwhile, the electronic specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ increases substantially, signifying an enhancement of the quasiparticle effective mass. The magnetic phase diagram has been established, in which an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point is avoided at $x_\mathrm{c}$. Conversely, the observed glass-like tail above the critical concentration aligns more closely with theoretical predictions for an extended region of quantum Griffiths phase in the presence of strong disorder.

arXiv:2412.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral magnets under broken time-reversal symmetry can give rise to rectification of moving electrons, called nonreciprocal transport. Several mechanisms, such as the spin-fluctuation-induced chiral scattering and asymmetry in the electronic band dispersion with and without the relativistic spin-orbit interaction, have been proposed, but clear identification as well as theoretical description of these different contributions are desired for full understanding of nonreciprocal transport phenomena. Here, we investigate a chiral magnet Co8Zn9Mn3 and find the nonreciprocal transport phenomena consisting of different contributions with distinct field- and temperature-dependence across the magnetic phase diagram over a wide temperature range including above room-temperature. We successfully separate the nonreciprocal resistivity into different components and identify their mechanisms as spin-fluctuation-induced chiral scattering and band asymmetry in a single material with the help of theoretical calculations.

Abstract: Broken inversion symmetry of magnetic lattice is normally described by Lifshitz invariants in micromagnetic energy functional. Three exceptions are the lattices with T$_\textrm{d}$, C$_\textrm{3h}$ and D$_\textrm{3h}$ point group symmetries. The inversion symmetry breaking of the corresponding magnets is described by more complex 4-spin chiral invariants that cannot be related to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Experimental detection of 4-spin chiral interactions is an important task that has yet to be performed. We propose that the 4-spin chiral interaction can be probed by energy selective magnon relaxation in two-dimensional ferromagnet Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ that possess D$_\textrm{3h}$ point group symmetry.

Abstract: The Kohn-Sham density functional method for the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect has recently been developed by mapping the strongly interacting electrons into an auxiliary system of weakly interacting composite fermions (CFs) that experience a density-dependent effective magnetic field. This approach has been successfully applied to explore the edge rescontruction, fractional charge and fractional braiding statistics of quasiparticle excitations. In this work, we investigate composite fermion excitons in the bulk of the disk geometry. By varying the separation of the quasiparticle-quasihole pairs and calculating their energy, we compare the dispersion of the magnetoroton mode with results from other numerical methods, such as exact diagonalization (ED) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Furthermore, through an evaluation of the spectral function, we identify chiral ``graviton'' excitations: a spin $-2$ mode for the particle-like Laughlin state and a spin $2$ mode for the hole-like Laughlin state. This method can be extended to construct neutral collective excitations for other fractional quantum Hall states in disk geometry.

Abstract: The intricate interplay between magnetism and the topology of electronic structures provides a rich avenue for tailoring materials with unique and potent anomalous transport properties. In this paper, we present a strategy for inducing robust Berry curvature and anomalous transverse conductivity in noncollinear antiferromagnets through an unconventional approach termed ``small \textit{staggered rotation} of spin". Considering noncollinear Mn$_3$Sn, we demonstrate that the positive vector chirality antiferromagnetic configuration, typically associated with a vanishing anomalous Hall effect and Nernst effect, can be manipulated to exhibit finite anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) through \textit{staggered rotation}. Furthermore, we illustrate that the value and sign of both the AHC and ANC can be tuned through \textit{staggered rotation}. This tuning is intricately influenced by the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced gapped nodal line, revealing the critical role of electronic structure modifications in achieving precise control over transport properties.

Abstract: We uncover a high-field magnetic phase in i-MAX compounds exhibiting a canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) order with unprecedented properties, revealed through NMR and AC susceptibility. Intriguingly, as the atomic number of Rare Earth increases, the transition field of this canted AFM phase grows at the expense of the lower-field AFM state. Our findings point to the complexity of the magnetic structure in i-MAX compounds, demonstrating a non-trivial evolution of their phase diagram while increasing both the atomic number of the Rare Earth element and the external field.

By means of photoluminescence, spin-flip Raman scattering, time-resolved Faraday ellipticity, and time-resolved differential transmission performed at temperatures in the range of $1.6 - 120$ K at magnetic fields up to 8 T, comprehensive information on the Land\'e $g$-factors as well as the population and spin dynamics is received. The spin signals are contributed by confined electrons with a $g$-factor close to 2, which shows a weak increase with decreasing NC size, i.e. increasing electron confinement energy. We revisit the theory of exciton confinement as a whole in spherical NCs within the six-band valence band model in order to describe the size dependence of the $Z_3$ and $Z_{1,2}$ exciton energies in CuCl NCs. We demonstrate theoretically that the stronger increase of the $Z_{1,2}$ energy transitions with decreasing radius can be explained by the strong absorption from the excited exciton state caused by strong heavy hole-light hole mixing in the exciton. The parameters of the six-band Hamiltonian describing both the exciton and hole kinetic energies are estimated from the comparison of the calculated and experimental size dependences of the exciton transitions. A theoretical model of the size-dependent Land\'e $g$-factors for electron and hole confined in spherical NCs of semiconductors with negative spin-orbit splitting of the valence band is developed.

Abstract: We investigate the resistive anisotropy in CsV3Sb5 thin films within the charge density wave phase. Using a device structure with twelve electrodes symmetrically distributed in a circular shape, we measure the resistivity anisotropy by varying the current direction. A twofold resistivity anisotropy modulated by temperature is found, which is fully consistent with the electronic nematicity in CsV3Sb5, that is, the spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking by electronic degree of freedom. Additionally, the resistivity anisotropy also shows modest changes by applying magnetic fields, implying the possible chiral charge orders with time-reversal symmetry breaking. These findings provide deep insights into the correlated electronic states in Kagome materials and highlight the unique properties of CsV3Sb5 in the two-dimensional regime.

arXiv:2412.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a distinct class of antiferromagnets with electronic structures resembling those of d-wave superconductors, exhibit intriguing properties that have gained significant attention in recent research. In this article, we propose synthetic altermagnets, composed of two anisotropic ferromagnetic layers arranged such that the total net magnetization is zero. We investigate the properties of these synthetic altermagnets, focusing on their electronic band structures, spin current, Berry curvature, and anomalous Hall conductivity. By developing a minimal model for our synthetic altermagnets, we examine the influence of factors such as anisotropic coupling strengths and spin-orbit coupling on the physical phenomena altermagnets manifest. Our findings open a new path for the realization of altermagnetic materials experimentally and highlight their potential applications in magneto-electronics, magneto-optics, and spintronics devices.

Abstract: Current-induced out of plane magnetization has been utilized for field-free switching of ferromagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Identifying systems capable of energy-efficiently converting charge currents into out of plane orbit- or spin-polarized currents is crucial for advancing magnetic memory technologies. Here we introduce the Berry curvature dipole as a key evaluation factor, directly measurable through nonlinear Hall effects. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 used in our experiments, applying a current parallel to the Berry curvature dipole results in out of plane orbital magnetization, which governs the field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in TaIrTe4/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructures. Notably, all-electric control of van der Waals magnetoresistive memory at room temperature has been achieved with a low critical current density 2x10^6A/cm2 for data writing. Our findings reveal the connection between nonlinear Hall effects and field-free magnetization switching, highlighting the potential of the Berry curvature dipole in advancing orbitronics.

arXiv:2412.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy fermion compound CeRh2As2 exhibits unconventional superconductivity accompanied by other broken symmetry phases that have been identified as presumably small moment intrinsic antiferromagnetism at low magnetic fields and induced quadrupolar order at higher in-plane fields. The latter may extend to very large pulsed-field range. The phase boundaries can be investigated by following thermodynamic anomalies like specific heat, magnetocaloric coefficient, thermal expansion and magnetostriction. We calculate their discontinuities and identify the influence of the field induced quadrupole on them. Furthermore we investigate the elastic constant anomalies which are determined by the static homogeneous quadrupolar RPA response functions. We present a calculation of these anomalies for the appropriate symmetry mode both in the disordered and ordered regime and investigate their change with applied field. In addition we consider the dynamical momentum dependent magnetic susceptibility and the associated dispersion of low energy magnetic modes and how their characteristics change across the phase boundary.

# Frictional Adhesive Contact of Multiferroic Coatings Based on the Hybrid Element Method

## 基于混合元素方法的多铁性涂层的摩擦粘合接触

arXiv:2412.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the frictional adhesive contact of a rigid insulating sphere sliding past a multiferroic coating deposed onto a rigid substrate, based on the hybrid element method (HEM). The adhesion behavior is described based on the Maugis-Dugdale (MD) model. The adhesion-driven conjugate gradient method (AD-CGM) is employed to calculate the distribution of unknown pressures, while the discrete convolution-fast Fourier transform (DC-FFT) is utilized to compute the deformations, surface electric and magnetic potentials as well as the subsurface stresses, electric displacements, and magnetic inductions. We found that the coating thickness affect the contact stiffness and the interplay between friction and adhesion. More importantly, friction and gap-dependent MD adhesion affects elastic, electric, and magnetic behavior of the interface, breaking the symmetry between leading and trailing edges behaviors in all the investigated fields. Indeed, increasing the friction coefficient, the contact shape is no longer circular, the pressure distribution shifts towards the leading edge, the electric/magnetic surface potentials distributions sharpen at the leading edge, and the subsurface stress fields concentrates at the trailing edges.

arXiv:2412.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Below the structural transition occurring at $T_s=90$\,K, FeSe exhibits positive transverse magnetoresistance when the current is applied parallel to the $ab$-plane. In this study, we show that, in contrast, when both the magnetic field and the current are aligned along the $c$-axis, the magnetotransport changes significantly. In this configuration, FeSe develops a sizable negative longitudinal magnetoresistance ($\sim$15\% at $T$=10\,K and $\mu_0H$=16\,T) in the nematic phase. We attribute this finding to the effect of the applied magnetic field on the scattering from spin fluctuations. Our observations reflect the intricate interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the nematic phase of FeSe.

Abstract: Fictitious magnetic fields can be introduced in quantum magnets by the strain engineering and the Aharonov-Casher effect. Here, we study impacts of a uniform fictitious magnetic field and corresponding Landau quantization on the Neel order in the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice as a prototypical system of quantum magnets. We first analyze the system by using the spin-wave approximation. It is found that the staggered magnetization is enhanced by the fictitious magnetic field and it shows a simple scaling behavior with respect to the magnetic length, in contrast to a naive expectation based on the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also perform density matrix renormalization group calculations to fully take quantum effects into account and obtain quantitatively more accurate results. The enhancement is found to be anomalously strong and it shows a non-trivial scaling behavior or a fluctuation induced discontinuity. These results are beyond the well known understanding of correlated systems under magnetic fields called the magnetic catalysis.

arXiv:2412.02133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems consisting of a collection of N spin-1/2 particles uniformly interacting with an electromagnetic field, such as one confined in a cavity, are important for the development of quantum information processors and will be useful for metrology, as well as tests of collective behavior. Such systems are often modeled by the Tavis-Cummings model and having an accurate understanding of the thermal behaviors of this system is needed to understand the behavior of them in realistic environments. We quantitatively show in this work that the Dicke subspace approximation is at times invoked too readily, in specific we show that there is a temperature above which the degeneracies in the system become dominant and the Dicke subspace is minimally populated. This transition occurs at a lower temperature than priorly considered. When in such a temperature regime, the key constants of the motion are the total excitation count between the spin system and cavity and the collective angular momentum of the spin system. These enable perturbative expansions for thermal properties in terms of the energy shifts of dressed states, called Lamb shifts herein. These enable efficient numeric methods for obtaining certain parameters that scale as $O(\sqrt{N})$, and is thus highly efficient. These provide methods for approximating, and bounding, properties of these systems as well as characterizing the dominant population regions, including under perturbative noise. In the regime of stronger spin-spin coupling the perturbations outweigh the expansion series terms and inefficient methods likely are needed to be employed, removing the computational efficiency of simulating such systems. The results in this work can also be used for related systems such as coupled-cavity arrays, cavity mediated coupling of collective spin ensembles, and collective spin systems.

Abstract: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.

Abstract: Previous symmetry-based database searches have already revealed ubiquitous band topology in nature, while the destiny of band topology under symmetry-breaking is yet to be studied comprehensively. Here we first develop a framework allowing systematically ascertaining topological state evolution as expressed via a tree-like graph for magnetic/non-magnetic crystalline material belonging to any of the 1651 magnetic space groups. Interestingly, we find that specifying different ways of realizing symmetry-breaking leads to various contractions of the tree-like graph, as a new angle of comprehensively characterizing the correlation between a spontaneous symmetry-breaking and any symmetry-group-indicated physics consequence. We also perform a high-throughput investigation on the 1267 stoichiometric magnetic materials ever-experimentally synthesized to reveal a hierarchy of topological states along all continuous paths of symmetry-breaking (preserving the translation symmetry) from the parent magnetic space group to P1. The results in this work are expected to aid experimentalists in selecting feasible and appropriate means to tune band topology towards realistic applications and promote further studies on using tree-like graph to explore the interconnection between topology and other intriguing orderings.

arXiv:2404.03889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NF) is a long-predicted example of itinerant ferromagnetism (IF) in the Hubbard model that has been studied theoretically for many years. The condition for NF, an infinite on-site Coulomb repulsion and a single hole in a half-filled band, does not arise naturally in materials. NF was only realized recently for the first time in experiments on a $2\times 2$ array of gated quantum dots. Dopant arrays and gated quantum dots in Si allow for engineering controllable systems with complex geometries. This makes quantum dot arrays good candidates to study NF in different geometries through analog quantum simulation. Here we present theoretical simulations done for $3\times 3$ arrays and larger $N\times N$ arrays, and predict the emergence of different forms of ferromagnetism in different geometries. We find NF in perfect $3\times 3$ arrays, and in $N\times N$ arrays for one hole doping of a half-filled band. The ratio of the hopping $t$ to Hubbard on-site repulsion $U$ that defines the onset of NF scales as $1/N^{4}$ as $N$ increases, approaching the bulk limit of infinite $U$ for large $N$. Additional simulations are done for geometries made by removing sites from $N\times N$ arrays. Different forms of ferromagnetism are found for different geometries. Loops show ferromagnetism, but only for three electrons. For loops, the critical $t/U$ for the onset of ferromagnetism scales as $N$ as the loop length increases. We show that the different dependences on size for loops and $N\times N$ arrays can be understood by scaling arguments that highlight the different energy contributions to each form of ferromagnetism. Our results show how analog quantum simulation with small arrays can elucidate the role of effects including wavefunction connectivity; system geometry, size and symmetry; bulk and edge sites; and kinetic energy in determining quantum magnetism of small systems.

Abstract: Topological flat bands formed in two-dimensional lattice systems offer unique opportunity to study the fractional phases of matter in the absence of an external magnetic field. Celebrated examples include fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects and fractional topological insulators. Recently, FQAH effects have been experimentally realized in both the twisted bilayer MoTe2 (tMoTe2) system and the rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene/hBN moir\'e systems. To date, experimental studies mainly focus on the first moir\'e flat band, except a very recent work that studied novel transport properties in higher moir\'e bands of a 2.1{\deg} tMoTe2 device. Here, we present the systematical transport study of approximately 3{\deg} tMoTe2 devices, especially for the second moir\'e band. At {\nu} = -2 and -4, time-reversal-symmetric single and double quantum spin Hall states formed, consistent with the previous observation in 2.1{\deg} tMoTe2 device. On the other hand, we observed ferromagnetism in the second moir\'e band, and a Chern insulator state driven by out-of-plane magnetic fields at {\nu} = -3. At {\nu} = -2.2 to -2.7, finite temperature resistivity minimum with 1/T scaling at low temperatures, and large out-of-plane negative magnetoresistance have been observed. Applying out-of-plane electric field can induce quantum phase transitions at both integer and fractional filling factors. Our studies pave the way for realizing tunable topological states and other unexpected magnetic phases beyond the first moir\'e flat band based on twisted MoTe2 platform.

Abstract: Altermagnet is an exotic class of magnetic materials wherein the Fermi surface exhibits a momentum-dependent spin-splitting while maintaining a net zero magnetization. Previous studies have shown that this distinctive spin-splitting can induce chiral p-wave superconductors or Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting states carrying finite momentum. However, the underlying mechanisms of such unconventional superconductivities remain elusive. Here, we propose that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) through the exchange field can play a significant role in such phenomena. Through a systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with the d-wave spin-splitting induced by the exchange field, as observed in RuO2, we demonstrate that the formation of the BFS suppresses conventional spin-singlet superconducting states with s-wave characteristics. In contrast, the chiral p-wave state maintains a fully gapped spectrum without the Fermi surface, thereby becoming the ground state in the strong field regime. In the intermediate regime, we find that the FF state becomes the predominant state through the optimization of available channels for Cooper pairing. Moreover, we illustrate how the prevalence of the chiral p-wave and FF states over the s-wave state changes under the variation of the field strength or chemical potential. Our findings provide valuable insights into potential pathways for realizing sought-after topological p-wave superconductivity and finite momentum pairing facilitated by altermagnetism.

Abstract: Alternative magnetic materials or ``altermagnets", characterized by their non-relativistic, momentum-dependent spin-split states, represent a cutting-edge advancement in the field of magnetism, offering promising avenues for spintronic applications. Among these materials, hexagonal MnTe has emerged as a standout material candidate for its substantial spin-splitting. In this study, employing first-principles electronic structure calculations and spin group symmetry analysis, we delve into the interplay of altermagnetism and pressure in two main phases of MnTe. Our relativistic calculations demonstrate the presence of tunable anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in hexagonal MnTe. In addition, our results underscore the pivotal role of pressure as a tuning parameter for the alternative magnetic traits in the system. Furthermore, we identify another phase of MnTe with orthorhombic structure, namely $\gamma$-MnTe, hosting altermagnetic characteristics. We study, in detail, its response in AHE and spin-spliting due to magnetization and pressure variations, respectively. Our study highlights the substantial impact of pressure on the properties of alternative magnetic materials, particularly emphasizing the pronounced tuning effect observed in the hexagonal and orthorhombic MnTe.

Abstract: Under the widely accepted but unproven assumption that the one-dimensional S=1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model has a unique gapped ground state, we prove that the model belongs to a nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index. This further implies the presence of a gapless edge excitation in the model on the half-infinite chain and the existence of a topological phase transition in the model that interpolates between the Heisenberg chain and the trivial model.

Abstract: We investigate the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall setups, where we subject a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field $\mathbf B $. For computing the in-plane transport components, we have added an elastic deformation which gives rise to a chirality-dependent effective magnetic field $ \mathbf B^{\text{tot}} = \mathbf B + \chi \, \mathbf B_5 $, where $\chi $ is the chirality of an RSW node. We have included the effects of orbital magnetic moment (OMM), in conjunction with the Berry curvature (BC), both of which appear as a consequence of nontrivial topology of the bandstructure. Due to the presence of four bands, RSW semimetals provide a richer structure for obtaining the linear-response coefficients, compared to the Weyl semimetals. In particular, we have found that the OMM-contributed terms may oppose or add up to the BC-only parts, depending on which band we are considering. Last, but not the least, we have determined the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, whose nature corroborates the findings of some recent experimental results.

Abstract: Noncollinear ferroic materials are sought after as testbeds to explore the intimate connections between topology and symmetry, which result in electronic, optical and magnetic functionalities not observed in collinear ferroic materials. For example, ferroaxial materials have ordered rotational structural distortions that break mirror symmetry and induce chirality. When ferroaxial order is coupled with ferroelectricity arising from a broken inversion symmetry, it offers the prospect of electric-field-control of the ferroaxial distortions and opens up new tunable functionalities. However, chiral multiferroics, especially ones stable at room temperature, are rare. We report the discovery of a strain-stabilized, room-temperature chiral multiferroic phase in single crystals of BaTiS$_3$, a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) hexagonal chalcogenide. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the stabilization of this multiferroic phase having $P6_3$ space group for biaxial tensile strains exceeding 1.5% applied on the basal ab-plane of the room temperature $P6_3cm$ phase of BaTiS$_3$. The chiral multiferroic phase is characterized by rotational distortions of select TiS$_6$ octahedra around the long $c$-axis and polar displacement of Ti atoms along the $c$-axis. We used an innovative approach using focused ion beam milling to make appropriately strained samples of BaTiS$_3$. The ferroaxial and ferroelectric distortions, and their domains in $P6_3$-BaTiS$_3$ were directly resolved using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Landau-based phenomenological modeling predicts a strong coupling between the ferroelectric and the ferroaxial order making $P6_3$-BaTiS$_3$ an attractive test bed for achieving electric-field control of chirality-related phenomena such as circular photo-galvanic current and the Rashba effect.

Abstract: The existence of exceptional points (EPs) ${-}$ where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors converge ${-}$ is a key characteristic of non-Hermitian physics. A newly-discovered class of magnets ${-}$ termed as altermagnets (AMs) ${-}$ are characterized by a net zero magnetization as well as spin-split bands. In this study, we propose the emergence of non-Hermitian physics at AM-ferromagnet (FM) junctions. We discover that such a junction hosts tunable EPs. We demonstrate that the positions of these emergent EPs can be tuned using an external applied magnetic field and show that for a critical value of the applied magnetic field the EPs can annihilate. Notably, the number and position of the EPs crucially depends on the type of AM and its orientation with respect to the FM. Our work puts forth a promising platform of exploration of non-Hermitian physics in an emerging class of magnetic materials.

Abstract: We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z<1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.

Abstract: Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heatmaps show a structural transition at 50 K, which could possibly be the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.

Abstract: Unraveling the microscopic mechanisms governing the physics of doped quantum magnets is key to advancing our understanding of strongly correlated quantum matter. Quantum simulation platforms, e.g., ultracold atoms in optical lattices or tweezer arrays, provide a powerful tool to investigate the interplay between spin and charge motion in microscopic detail. Here, in a new twist, we disentangle the role of particle statistics from the physics of strong correlations by exploring the strong coupling limit of doped \emph{bosonic} quantum magnets, specifically the antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t-J$ model. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we map out the phase diagram on the 2D square lattice at finite doping. In the low-doping regime, bosonic holes form partially-filled stripes, akin to those observed in high-$T_c$ cuprates. As doping increases, a transition occurs to a partially-polarized ferromagnetic (FM) phase, driven by the motion of mobile bosonic charge carriers forming Nagaoka polarons. At high doping or large $t/J$, the system evolves into a fully-polarized ferromagnet. These findings shed new light on the role of particle statistics in strongly correlated many-body systems, revealing connections to stripe formation and the physics of kinetic (i.e., Nagaoka-type) ferromagnetism. Our results may be realized in state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms with bosonic quantum gas microscopes and Rydberg atom tweezer arrays, paving the way for future experimental studies of doped bosonic quantum magnets.

Abstract: Several heavy fermion materials, including UPt$_3$, exhibit a rapid but gradual rise in the magnetization at a critical field, without an apparent phase transition at any temperature $T>0$, with the possibility of a first order transition at $T \equiv0$. To model such a quantum phase transition it is most appropriate to develop approaches considering the quantum nature of the spins. Within a fully classical framework, we show that it is sufficient to start from a Landau-type free energy with an added Bragg-Williams entropy term to arrive at a number of key experimental features as seen in UPt$_3$. In particular, we show that correctly arriving at the measured (low-field) higher order susceptibilities necessarily invokes an isobestic (crossing) point at a high field in the magnetization isotherms. We also present a full analysis of the angular dependence of the (low-field) linear and nonlinear susceptibilities which when extended also capture the anisotropic high field response of the magnetization. Key to this success is the proper conversion of the evaluated magnetization from constant volume to a constant pressure situation relevant at high fields in heavy fermion materials.

Abstract: The rare-earth chalcogenide $ARECh_{2}$ family ($A =$ alkali metal or monovalent ions, $RE =$ rare earth, $Ch =$ chalcogen) has emerged as a paradigmatic platform for studying frustrated magnetism on a triangular lattice. The family members exhibit a variety of ground states, from quantum spin liquid to exotic ordered phases, providing fascinating insight into quantum magnetism. Their simple crystal structure and chemical tunability enable systematic exploration of competing interactions in quantum magnets. Recent neutron scattering and thermodynamic studies have revealed rich phase diagrams and unusual excitations, refining theoretical models of frustrated systems. This review provides a succinct introduction to $ARECh_{2}$ research. It summarizes key findings on crystal structures, single-ion physics, magnetic Hamiltonians, ground states, and low-energy excitations. By highlighting current developments and open questions, we aim to catalyze further exploration and deeper physical understanding on this frontier of quantum magnetism.

# Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings

Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.

# Continuous Collapse of the Spin Cycloid in BiFeO3 Thin Films under an Applied Magnetic Field probed by Neutron Scattering

Abstract: Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is one of the rare materials that exhibits multiferroic properties already at room-temperature. Therefore, it offers tremendous potential for future technological applications, such as memory and logic. However, a weak magnetoelectric coupling together with the presence of a noncollinear cycloidal spin order restricts various practical applications of BiFeO3. Therefore, there is a large interest in the search for suitable methods for the modulation of the spin cycloid in BiFeO3. By performing neutron diffraction experiments using a triple-axis instrument we have determined that the spin cycloid can be systematically suppressed by applying a high magnetic field of 10 T in a BiFeO3 thin film of about 100 nm grown on a (110)-oriented SrTiO3 substrate. As predicted by previous theoretical calculations, we observed that the required critical magnetic field to suppress the spin cycloid in a BiFeO3 thin film was lower as compared to the previously reported critical magnetic field for bulk BiFeO3 single crystals. Our experiment reveals that the spin cycloid continuously expands with increasing magnetic field before the complete transformation into a G-type antiferromagnetic spin order. Such tuning of the length of the spin cycloid up to a complete suppression offers new functionalities for future technological applications as in spintronics or magnonics.

# Photon Frequency Conversion in High-$Q$ Superconducting Resonators: Axion Electrodynamics, QED & Nonlinear Meissner Radiation

## 高 $ Q $ 超导谐振器中的光子频率转换: 轴子电动力学，QED和非线性迈斯纳辐射

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08275

arXiv:2408.08275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-Q superconducting resonators have been proposed and developed as detectors of light-by-light scattering mediated by the hypothesized axion or virtual electron-positron pairs in quantum electrodynamics - the Euler-Heisenberg (EH) interaction. Photon frequency and mode conversion is central to the scheme for detecting such rare events. Superconducting resonators are nonlinear devices. The Meissner screening currents that confine the electromagnetic fields to the vacuum region of a superconducting RF cavity are nonlinear functions of the EM field at the vacuum-superconducting interface, and as a result can generate source currents and frequency conversion of microwave photons in the cavity. In this report we consider photon frequency and mode conversion in superconducting resonators with high quality factors from Meissner currents in single and dual cavity setups proposed for axion and QED searches based on light-by-light scattering. In a single cavity with two pump modes photon frequency conversion by the Meissner screening current dominates photon generation by the EH interaction for cavities with $Q \lesssim 10^{12}$. The Meissner currents also generate background photons that limits the operation of the resonator for axion detection in three-mode, single cavity setups. We also consider the leakage of photons from pump modes into the signal mode for both axion and EH mediated light-by-light scattering. Photon frequency conversion by the EH interaction can compete with Meissner and leakage radiation in \emph{ultra-high-Q} cavities that are beyond current state of the art. Meissner radiation and leakage backgrounds can be suppressed in dual cavity setups with appropriate choices for pump and spectator modes, as well as the single-cavity setup proposed for heterodyne detection of galactic axion dark matter.

# Exact linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems

arXiv:2411.06967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states (NEASS) approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_H$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance.
  A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of ion-scale turbulence-generated currents on the local safety factor profile under conditions of low magnetic shear and proximity to rational surfaces, relevant to Internal Transport Barrier (ITB) formation. Our results show that turbulent currents can generate stationary zonal magnetic potential corrugations, producing a stepped safety factor profile with extended regions of zero magnetic shear. This change significantly affects turbulence self-interaction, resulting in a substantial decrease in turbulent transport, indicating a potential triggering mechanism for transport barrier formation.

# Parallel diffusion operator for magnetized plasmas with improved spectral fidelity

## 具有改进的光谱保真度的磁化等离子体的平行扩散算子

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01927

arXiv:2412.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive transport processes in magnetized plasmas are highly anisotropic, with fast parallel transport along the magnetic field lines sometimes faster than perpendicular transport by orders of magnitude. This constitutes a major challenge for describing non-grid-aligned magnetic structures in Eulerian (grid-based) simulations. The present paper describes and validates a new method for parallel diffusion in magnetized plasmas based on the anti-symmetry representation [Halpern and Waltz, Phys. Plasmas 25, 060703 (2018)]. In the anti-symmetry formalism, diffusion manifests as a flow operator involving the logarithmic derivative of the transported quantity. Qualitative plane wave analysis shows that the new operator naturally yields better discrete spectral resolution compared to its conventional counterpart. Numerical simulations comparing the new method against existing finite difference methods are carried out, showing significant improvement. In particular, we find that combining anti-symmetry with finite differences in diagonally staggered grids essentially eliminates the so-called "artificial numerical diffusion" that affects conventional finite difference and finite volume methods.

# Universal energy cascade in critically balanced homogeneous ferrofluid turbulence

arXiv:2412.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ferrofluids, the vorticity is balanced by the rate of particle rotation, which is known here as critical balance. The universal energy cascade is investigated for a stationary and non-stationary incompressible ferrofluid turbulent system using exact relations. The findings reveal that under moderate magnetic fields, kinetic and total energy cascades occur at identical rates. As the external magnetic field strength increases, the total energy cascade becomes non-stationary and differs from the kinetic one. However, the cascade's universal, scale-independent nature remains unaffected. The suppression of turbulence in ferrofluids is observable at strong magnetic fields.

Abstract: Centrifugal confinement fusion, a promising alternative to toroidal confinement devices like tokamaks and stellarators, leverages supersonic plasma rotation within a magnetic mirror configuration to achieve simplified coil design, compactness, and enhanced stability. This brief article explores the potential of centrifugal confinement fusion for propulsion applications. A previous concern regarding the escape of energetic ions, essential for propulsion, is addressed through test-particle simulations. The results indicate that the earlier estimate based on adiabatic invariance was overly pessimistic, and the underlying physics is clarified.

# Band structure reconstruction in the topological semimetal PrAlSi

## 拓扑半金属PrAlSi中的能带结构重建

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02203

arXiv:2412.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between nontrivial topology, magnetism and strong correlation has generated considerable research interest in condensed matter physics. The topological RAlX (R = rare earth ; X = Si and Ge) family has provided an excellent platform for exploring these complex interactions. Here, we performed infrared spectroscopy measurements on the ferromagnetic (FM) topological semimetal PrAlSi, in oder to investigate the impact of FM orderings on the topological band structure. We find that the optical conductivity associated with the Dirac/Weyl cones exhibits two segments of linearly increasing parts in the normal state, connected by a kink feature at around 1 960 cm-1. By entering the FM state, however, an additional linear-growing segment shows up in between the original ones, suggesting that the band structure is reconstructed. We propose that these observations can be effectively explained by a scenario where the Dirac/Weyl nodes are split into pairs of Weyl nodes with lower degeneracy, due to the time reversal symmetry breaking induced by the FM ordering. This band structure reconstruction also leads to a sudden enhancement of the itinerant carrier density. In addition, the effective mass of the itinerant carriers are estimated to be two orders of magnitude smaller than the free electron mass, providing a rare case where nearly all the free carriers exhibit behaviors characteristic of relativistic Dirac or Weyl fermions. Our results demonstrate an compelling example of the strong interaction between magnetic order and topological band structures, which opens up new avenues for exploring novel topological materials and their potential applications.

# Enhancing Vector Network Analysis With a Photonic Frequency Extender Setup

## 使用光子频率扩展器设置增强矢量网络分析

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02532

arXiv:2412.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a photonic ultra-wideband frequency extension for a commercial Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to perform free-space measurements in a frequency range from 70 GHz up to 520 GHz with a Hz level resolution. The concept is based on the synchronization of continuous-wave (CW) lasers with highly frequency-stable electronic emitter sources as a reference. The use of CW photomixers with bandwidths up to several terahertz allows for the straightforward expansion of the covered frequency range to 1 THz or even beyond. This can be achieved, for instance, by cascading additional lasers within the synchronization scheme. Consequently, the necessity for additional frequency extender modules, as seen in current state-of-the-art VNAs, is eliminated, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of the system significantly. To showcase the capabilities of the Photonic Vector Network Analyzer (PVNA) extender concept, we conducted S21 transmission measurements of various cross-shaped bandpass filters and waveguide-coupled high-frequency (HF) components. Additionally, the analyzed magnitude and phase data were either compared to electro-magnetic (EM) simulations or referenced against data obtained from commercial electronic frequency extender modules.

# Quadrupolar Density Structures in Driven Magnetic Reconnection Experiments with a Guide Field

## 具有引导场的驱动磁重联实验中的四极密度结构

arXiv:2412.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous process in plasma physics, driving rapid and energetic events such as coronal mass ejections. Reconnection between magnetic fields with arbitrary shear can be decomposed into an anti-parallel, reconnecting component, and a non-reconnecting guide-field component which is parallel to the reconnecting electric field. This guide field modifies the structure of the reconnection layer and the reconnection rate. We present results from experiments on the MAIZE pulsed-power generator (500 kA peak current, 200 ns rise-time) which use two exploding wire arrays, tilted in opposite directions, to embed a guide field in the plasma flows with a relative strength $b\equiv B_g/B_{rec}=\text{0, 0.4, or 1}$. The reconnection layers in these experiments have widths which are less than the ion skin depth, $d_i=c/\omega_{pi}$, indicating the importance of the Hall term, which generates a distinctive quadrupolar magnetic field structure along the separatrices of the reconnection layer. Using laser imaging interferometry, we observe quadrupolar structures in the line-integrated electron density, consistent with the interaction of the embedded guide field with the quadrupolar Hall field. Our measurements extend over much larger length scales ($40 d_i$) at higher $\beta$ ($\sim 1$) than previous experiments, providing an insight into the global structure of the reconnection layer.

Abstract: Solar filaments are spectacular objects in the solar atmosphere, consisting of accumulations of cool, dense, and partially ionized plasma suspended in the hot solar corona against gravity. The magnetic structures that support the filament material remain elusive, partly due to the lack of high resolution magnetic field measurements in the chromosphere and corona. In this study, we reconstruct the magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament using EUV observations and two different methods, to follow the injection of hot material from a B-class solar flare. Our analysis reveals the fine-scale magnetic structures of the filament, including a compact set of mutually wrapped magnetic fields encasing the cool filament material, two groups of helical magnetic structures intertwining with the main filament, and a series of arched magnetic loops positioned along the filament. Additionally, we also find that the northern footpoints of the helical structures are rooted in the same location, while their southern footpoints are rooted in different areas. The results obtained in this study offer new insights into the formation and eruption mechanisms of solar filaments.

Abstract: The paper presents solution of quantum problem of neutron propagation in the magnetic field with multipole field expansion. Rigorous solution of the Pauli equation for neutron reveals existence of two solutions, finite and infinite, for any miltipole configuration. As an example, we present detailed study of neutron motion in quadrupole and sextupole. Our predictions agree with the results of Stern-Gerlach experiment for neutrons. To verify existence of finite and infinite motion, we discuss an experiment which could be performed in the Budker Insitute of Nuclear Physics using existing equipment. We conclude with the proposal of neutron-electron intersecting ring (neutron-electron ``collider''), which, if realized, would allow to accomplish a number of important experiments devoting to study neutron internal structure.

# Thermal state structure in the Tavis--Cummings model and rapid simulations in mesoscopic quantum ensembles

arXiv:2412.02133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems consisting of a collection of N spin-1/2 particles uniformly interacting with an electromagnetic field, such as one confined in a cavity, are important for the development of quantum information processors and will be useful for metrology, as well as tests of collective behavior. Such systems are often modeled by the Tavis-Cummings model and having an accurate understanding of the thermal behaviors of this system is needed to understand the behavior of them in realistic environments. We quantitatively show in this work that the Dicke subspace approximation is at times invoked too readily, in specific we show that there is a temperature above which the degeneracies in the system become dominant and the Dicke subspace is minimally populated. This transition occurs at a lower temperature than priorly considered. When in such a temperature regime, the key constants of the motion are the total excitation count between the spin system and cavity and the collective angular momentum of the spin system. These enable perturbative expansions for thermal properties in terms of the energy shifts of dressed states, called Lamb shifts herein. These enable efficient numeric methods for obtaining certain parameters that scale as $O(\sqrt{N})$, and is thus highly efficient. These provide methods for approximating, and bounding, properties of these systems as well as characterizing the dominant population regions, including under perturbative noise. In the regime of stronger spin-spin coupling the perturbations outweigh the expansion series terms and inefficient methods likely are needed to be employed, removing the computational efficiency of simulating such systems. The results in this work can also be used for related systems such as coupled-cavity arrays, cavity mediated coupling of collective spin ensembles, and collective spin systems.

# Sublayers Editing of Covalent MAX Phase for Nanolaminated Early Transition Metal Compounds

arXiv:2412.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have gained popularity in fields such as energy storage, catalysis, and electromagnetic interference due to their diverse elemental compositions and variable surface terminations (T). Generally, the synthesis of MXene materials involves etching the weak M-A metallic bonds in the ternary layered transition metal carbides and nitrides (MAX phase) using HF acid or Lewis acid molten salts, while the strong M-X covalent bonds preserve the two-dimensional framework structure of MXenes. On the other hand, the MAX phase material family also includes a significant class of members where the A site is occupied by non-metal main group elements (such as sulfur and phosphorus), in which both M-A and M-X are covalent bond-type sublayers. The aforementioned etching methods cannot be used to synthesize MXene materials from these parent phases. In this work, we discovered that the covalent bond-type M-A and M-X sublayers exhibit different reactivity with some inorganic materials in a high-temperature molten state. By utilizing this difference in reactivity, we can structurally modify these covalent sublayers, allowing for the substitution of elements at the X site (from B to Se, S, P, C) and converting non-metal A site atoms in non-van der Waals (non-vdW) MAX phases into surface atoms in vdW layered materials. This results in a family of early transition metal Xide chalcogenides (TMXCs) that exhibit lattice characteristics of both MXenes and transition metal chalcogenides. Using electron-donor chemical scissors, these TMXC layered materials can be further exfoliated into monolayer nanosheets. The atomic configurations of each atom in these monolayer TMXCs are the same as those of conventional MXenes, but the oxidation states of the M-site atoms can be regulated by both X-site atoms and intercalated cations.

Abstract: We present a quantum optics-based detection method for determining the position and current of an electron beam. As electrons pass through a dilute vapor of rubidium atoms, their magnetic field perturb the atomic spin's quantum state and causes polarization rotation of a laser resonant with an optical transition of the atoms. By measuring the polarization rotation angle across the laser beam, we recreate a 2D projection of the magnetic field and use it to determine the e-beam position, size and total current. We tested this method for an e-beam with currents ranging from 30 to 110 {\mu}A. Our approach is insensitive to electron kinetic energy, and we confirmed that experimentally between 10 to 20 keV. This technique offers a unique platform for non-invasive characterization of charged particle beams used in accelerators for particle and nuclear physics research.

Abstract: This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of photonic time crystals - artificial materials whose electromagnetic properties are periodically modulated in time at scales comparable to the oscillation period of light while remaining spatially uniform. Being the temporal analogs to traditional photonic crystals, photonic time crystals differ in that they exhibit momentum bandgaps instead of energy bandgaps. The energy is not conserved within momentum bandgaps, and eigenmodes with exponentially growing amplitudes exist in the momentum bandgap. Such properties make photonic time crystals a fascinating novel class of artificial materials from a basic science and applied perspective. This tutorial overviews the fundamental electromagnetic equations governing photonic time crystals and explores the groundbreaking physical phenomena they support. Based on these properties, we also oversee a diverse range of applications they unlock. Different material platforms suitable for creating photonic time crystals are discussed and compared. Furthermore, we elaborate on the connections between wave amplification in photonic time crystals and parametric amplification mechanisms in electrical circuits and nonlinear optics. The tutorial will be helpful for readers with physics or engineering backgrounds. It is designed to serve as an introductory guide for beginners and to establish a reference baseline reflecting the current understanding for researchers in the field.

Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamic-kinetic (MHD-kinetic) hybrid model [Park et. al., 1992] has been widely applied in studying energetic particles (EPs) problems in fusion plasmas for past decades. The pressure-coupling scheme or the current-coupling scheme is adopted in this model. However, two noteworthy issues arise in the model application: firstly, the coupled term introduced in the pressure-coupling scheme, $\left( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{h}} \right)_{\bot}$, is often simplified by $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{h}}$, which is equivalent to neglecting the parallel inertial term of EPs; secondly, besides the $\delta f $ contribution caused by changing in the EP distribution function, the magnetic field perturbation (the $\delta \mathbf{B} $ contribution) generated during development of the instabilities should also be considered, but it is often ignored in existing hybrid simulations. In this paper, we derive the analytical formulations under these two coupling schemes and then numerically study the representative case of the linear stability of the m/n=1/1 internal kink mode (IKM) [Fu et. al., 2006] by using the CLT-K code. It is found that the approximated models can still yield reasonable results when EPs are isotopically distributed. But it fails completely in cases with anisotropic EP distributions. In addition, we further investigate the influence of EP's orbit width on the stability of IKM and verify the equivalence between pressure-coupling scheme and the current-coupling scheme.

Second, a simplified 2D transverse magnetic example was simulated in carbon disulfide, with its strong molecular re-orientation induced polarization anisotropy.

Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.

The molecular symmetry in rare earth (RE) coordination chemistry is critically important for controlling the electronic structure of the RE ion and resulting magnetic and photophysical properties. Here we report a family with unusual C3 point symmetry, [REIII(Br4catH)3(tpa)] (Br4catH− = tetrabromocatecholate, tpa = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine). The synthesis and solid-state characterisation of eleven analogues (RE = Y, Sm to Lu) were performed, enabling a systematic investigation of the effect of symmetry on various physical properties across the RE series. The crystal structures reveal a unique cooperative coordination motif, featuring a cyclic hydrogen-bonding network between the atypical monodentate monoprotonated Br4catH− ligands. Electrochemistry reveals a single oxidation process that suggests a concerted three-electron oxidation of all tetrabromocatecholate ligands to semiquinonate. Furthermore, single-molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour was investigated, revealing unexpected in-field slow magnetic relaxation for both Dy and Yb analogues, which can be rationalised by the effect of C3-symmetry. Finally, luminescence measurements were performed to probe the CF splitting of the Yb analogue and quantify the error in the overall CF splitting suggested by ab initio calculations.  The governing effects of C3-symmetry are consistent observations in all RE3+ metals studied in this work, manifesting in the concerted three-electron oxidation, SMM behaviour, ground state composition, and luminescence properties.

Ferrites can be considered as special cases of magnetite where Fe2+ cations are replaced with other divalent metal cations. The synthetic protocols for the production of ferrite nanoparticles also bear striking similarities to the preparation of magnetite. Synthetic methods followed for the preparation of the ferrite nanoparticles are known to alter magnetic, catalytic, and optoelectronic properties drastically. Thus, optimizing the synthetic protocol for the fine-tuning of dimension and morphology-dependent properties is of primary importance. In this work, the use of simple metal nitrate salts as precursor materials for the preparation of ferrite nanoparticles is described. The alcoholic hydrolysis of the metal nitrates in isopropanol produces corresponding hydroxides, which, in addition to oleic acid, result in metal-oleate complexes. Thermal decomposition of the precursor oleate complex produces highly monodispersed ferrite nanoparticles.

# CATATOnia treatment with transcranial direct current ElectroStimulation: protocol of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled bicentric superiority study (CATATOES)

## 经颅直流电刺激治疗紧张症: 一项随机，双盲，安慰剂对照的双中心优势研究 (CATATOES) 的方案

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5355181/latest

Background
Catatonia is a severe psychomotor syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. Lorazepam and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are the main recommended treatments. Lorazepam-resistant catatonia accounts for about 30% of cases, particularly in neurodevelopmental disorders. ECT is crucial in these situations but faces challenges of tolerability and accessibility. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a promising intervention, is emerging as a non-invasive, cost-effective neurostimulation tool and has demonstrated efficacy and safety in case reports and small series of catatonic patients (N &amp;lt; 10). The CATATOES study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of tDCS using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, bicentric superiority trial involving 70 patients with catatonia. Secondary objectives aim to highlight the mechanism of action of tDCS and to explore the pathophysiology of catatonia.
Methods
Seventy participants with lorazepam-resistant catatonia will undergo 20 sessions of active or sham tDCS, administered twice daily at two mA for 20 minutes, with anodal stimulation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathodal stimulation in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). In addition to daily clinical assessment, patients will undergo (i) structural, functional and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (ii) 64-channel resting state electroencephalogram (EEG), and (iii) blood test with inflammatory, neurogenesis and genetic markers, before, during and after the treatment course.
Discussion
Catatonia is in critical need of therapeutic improvement. We anticipate that this study will pave the way for the routine use of tDCS in the treatment of lorazepam-resistant catatonia, ultimately contributing to a reduction of morbidity, mortality, and associated costs of catatonia.

# Glutathione Effects on Liver Enzymes and Serum Electrolyte in Mice Exposed to 850&ndash;1900 MHz Mobile Phone Radiation

## 谷胱甘肽对850-1900 MHz手机辐射小鼠肝酶和血清电解质的影响

Background
The widespread presence of electromagnetic fields (EMF) produced by modern technologies may pose a significant threat to animal health. Ionizing radiation, a byproduct of EMF exposure, has the potential to contribute to serious diseases, including cancer. This study examines the impact of chronic exposure to 900-1800 MHz GSM-EMF-induced electromagnetic radiation on liver enzymes and serum electrolytes in mice, and the potential mitigating effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) administration. Thirty-five adult male mice were randomly divided into seven groups and exposed to various modes of mobile phone radiation for five weeks, with or without GSH administration. Liver enzymes, Alkaline phosphates (ALP), Alanine transaminase (ALT) , Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and, serum electrolytes, sodium, potassium and bicarbonate were analyzed.
Result
Results showed significant increases in ALP levels in the Silent, Ringtone + GSH, and Silent + GSH groups compared to control group, while ALT and AST levels remained largely unchanged with the exception of some groups across the experimental cohorts. Serum electrolyte concentrations did not significantly differ across the control group. Our study found that chronic mobile phone radiation exposure in mice generally does not significantly affect liver enzyme levels or serum electrolyte concentrations. However, certain combinations with GSH administration notably increased some biochemical markers like ALP, ALT, and AST levels.&amp;nbsp;
Conclusions
Our study concluded that chronic mobile phone radiation had no significant impact on liver enzymes or serum electrolytes in mice. However, glutathione administration in combination with radiation increased liver enzyme levels, suggesting a potential role in oxidative stress mitigation. Further research is needed to explore these findings.

# Liquid-matter relaxor ferroelectrics: from double-well to flatten energy landscapes in polar nematic fluids

## 液态弛豫铁电体: 从极性向列流体中的双阱到平坦的能量景观

Knowing that the traditional relaxor ferroelectrics stem in crystalline matters, one may ask whether one would stabilize the liquid-matter analogy. The perspective is challenging and may enable a generic design of fluidic and flexible relaxor ferroelectrics. In this report, we unveil a novel polar matter state, dubbed the nematic relaxor ferroelectrics, by artificially introducing random-field polar nanoregions with nematicity into a dielectric nematic environment. We observe clear signatures of relaxors with strong field-induced polarizations, up to 1.1 &mu;C&middot;cm-2 at an ultralow electric field at 5 V&middot;&mu;m-1, and ultrahigh dielectric permittivity over a broad temperature range. Based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, we reconstruct free-energy landscapes from electricity-field vs polarization curves. We discover a continuous modification of energy landscapes from a double-well shape to a single-well shape with a broadening energy bottom, corresponding to a shift from nematic ferroelectrics to nematic relaxors with significant polarization fluctuations.

# Evaluation of response to Targeted therapy and immunotherapy for advanced HCCs: A retrospective, controlled study

## 晚期肝癌靶向治疗和免疫治疗反应的评价: 一项回顾性对照研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5389481/latest

Background: To validate the correlation between radiomics extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathologic alterations in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with targeted therapy and immunotherapy, and to compare the accuracy of necrosis evaluation by radiologists and subtraction technology.
Methods: Thirty-five patients diagnosed unresectable HCCs (n = 39) who underwent curative resection at two centers after receiving combined treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and programmed death ligand-1 antibodies were included. Using linear regression model to verify the consistency between investigator-based imaging evaluation and three-dimensional (3D) subtraction-based imaging analysis and their capability to distinguish major pathological response (MPR) and pathological complete remission (PCR) were compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with pathological outcome as the gold standard.The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were compared.
Results: 3D subtraction-based imaging analysis suggested a strong correlation with histopathologic alteration (R2 = 0.81) and was superior in classifying MPR or PCR comparing to the use of investigator-based imaging evaluation (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve: MRP, 0.80 vs. 0.52; PCR, 0.69 vs. 0.54).
Conclusion: 3D subtraction-based imaging analysis based on tumor characteristics showed a stronger correlation with pathology, and 3D subtraction-based imaging analysis was significantly superior to investigator-based imaging evaluation in classifying MPR or PCR.
