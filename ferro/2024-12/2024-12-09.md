# Modulation of heat flow by means of electric fields enables the creation of thermal circuits

## 通过电场调节热流可以创建热回路

Overheating in electronic devices affects how it works and how long it lasts. One of the major challenges is efficiently managing the heat generated by these systems during operation, which involves controlling the thermal conductivity of the materials they comprise. While electric current can be easily manipulated in conventional electronic materials, heat presents a different challenge: phonons, the particles that transport heat in crystalline solids, lack both charge and magnetic moment, making them much harder to control.

# Spin dynamics of an easy-plane Dirac spin liquid in a frustrated XY model: Application to honeycomb cobaltates

## 在受挫的XY模型中易平面Dirac自旋液体的自旋动力学: 在蜂窝状钴酸盐中的应用

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04544

arXiv:2412.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the honeycomb lattice spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_3$ XY model, with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic exchange $J_1$ and frustration induced by third-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange $J_3$, may be relevant to a wide range of cobaltate materials. We explore a variational Monte Carlo study of Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions for this model and show that an easy-plane Dirac spin liquid (DSL) is a viable `parent' state for the competing magnetic orders observed in these materials, including ferromagnetic, zig-zag, spiral, and double zig-zag orders at intermediate frustration, and show that such broken symmetry states can be easily polarized by a weak in-plane magnetic field consistent with experiments. We formulate a modified parton theory for such frustrated spin models, and explore the potential instabilities of the DSL due to residual parton interactions within a random phase approximation (RPA), both at zero magnetic field and in a nonzero in-plane field. The broken symmetry states which emerge in the vicinity of this Dirac spin liquid include ferromagnetic, zig-zag, and incommensurate spiral orders, with a phase diagram which is consistent with VMC and density matrix renormalization group studies. We calculate the dynamical spin response of the easy-plane DSL, including RPA corrections, near the boundary of the ordered states, and present results for THz spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering, at zero field as well as in an in-plane magnetic field, and discuss experimental implications.

# Spin Chern number in altermagnets

## 地磁中的自旋Chern数

arXiv:2412.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the topological properties of altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials. We employ equivariant K-theory of magnetic groups and Hamiltonian models to formulate a robust $C^z_4 \mathbb{T}$ topological invariant to classify 2D and 3D altermagnetic systems. Our findings demonstrate that the spin Chern number serves as a robust topological index, corresponding to the half-quantized Chern number of the divided Brillouin zone. This indicator enables the prediction of a topologically protected 2D altermagnetic insulators and 3D Weyl altermagnetic semimetals, highlighting the relationship between altermagnetism and topological phases. Furthermore, our results provide a pathway to the exploration of topological applications in $d$-wave altermagnetic materials.

# Semiclassical Model of Magnons in Double-Layered Antiferromagnets

## 双层反铁磁体中磁振子的半经典模型

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04685

arXiv:2412.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of the double-layered antiferromagnets and their magnonic properties are investigated by considering two model systems, the linear chain (LC) and more complex chain of railroad trestle (RT) geometry, and a real example of chromium nitride CrN. The spin-paired order ($\cdots{+}{+}{-}{-}\cdots$) in LC requires an alternation of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions, while analogous spin-paired order in RT can be stable even for all magnetic exchange interactions being AFM. The rock-salt structure of CrN evokes clear magnetic frustration since Cr atoms in face-centered cubic lattice form links to twelve nearest neighbors all equivalent and AFM. Nonetheless, the magnetostructural transition to an orthorhombically distorted phase below $T_\text{N} = 287~\text{K}$ leads to a diversification of Cr-Cr links, which suppresses the frustration and allows for stable double-layered AFM order of CrN. Based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculated exchange parameters, the magnon spectra and temperature evolution of ordered magnetic moments are derived.

# A simple model for longitudinal electron transport during and after laser excitation: Emergence of electron resistive transport

## 激光激发期间和之后纵向电子传输的简单模型: 电子电阻传输的出现

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04691

arXiv:2412.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-driven electron transport across a sample has garnered enormous attentions over several decades, as it provides a much faster way to control electron dynamics. Light is an electromagnetic wave, so how and why an electron can acquire a longitudinal velocity remains unanswered. Here we show that it is the magnetic field that steers the electron to the light propagation direction. But, quantitatively, our free-electron model is still unable to reproduce the experimental velocities. Going beyond the free electron mode and assuming the system absorbs all the photon energy, the theoretical velocity matches the experimental observation. We introduce a concept of the resistive transport, where electrons deaccelerate under a constant resistance after laser excitation. This theory finally explains why the experimental distance-versus-time forms a down-concave curve, and unifies ballistic and superdiffusive transports into a single resistive transport. We expect that our finding will motivate further investigations.

# Weyl Geometry in Weyl Semimetals

## Weyl半金属中的Weyl几何

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04743

arXiv:2412.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel oscillatory behaviour of the DC conductivity in Weyl semimetals with vacancies has recently been identified, occurring in the absence of external magnetic fields. Here, we argue that this effect has a geometric interpretation in terms of a magnetic-like field induced by an emergent Weyl connection. This geometric gauge field is related to the non-metricity of the underlying effective geometry, which is physically induced by vacancies in the lattice system. Finally, we postulate that the chiral magnetic effect in Weyl semimetals can be affected by the presence of dynamical vacancies.

# Origin of Increased Curie Temperature in Lithium-Substituted Ferroelectric Niobate Perovskite: Enhancement of the Soft Polar Mode

## 锂取代的铁电铌酸盐钙钛矿中居里温度升高的起源: 软极性模式的增强

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04810

arXiv:2412.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functionality of ferroelectrics is often constrained by their Curie temperature, above which depolarization occurs. Lithium (Li) is the only experimentally known substitute that can increase the Curie temperature in ferroelectric niobate-based perovskites, yet the mechanism remains unresolved. Here, the unique phenomenon in Li-substituted KNbO3 is investigated using first-principles density functional theory. Theoretical calculations show that Li substitution at the A-site of perovskite introduces compressive chemical pressure, reducing Nb-O hybridization and associated ferroelectric instability. However, the large off-center displacement of the Li cation compensates for this reduction and further enhances the soft polar mode, thereby raising the Curie temperature. In addition, the stability of the tetragonal phase over the orthorhombic phase is predicted upon Li substitution, which reasonably explains the experimental observation of a decreased orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition temperature. Finally, a metastable anti-phase polar state in which the Li cation displaces oppositely to the Nb cation is revealed, which could also contribute to the variation of phase transition temperatures. These findings provide critical insights into the atomic-scale mechanisms governing Curie temperature enhancement in ferroelectrics and pave the way for designing advanced ferroelectric materials with improved thermal stability and functional performance.

Abstract: Atomically thin materials with coupled magnetic and electric polarization are critical for developing energy-efficient and high-density spintronic devices, yet they remain scarce due to often conflicting requirements of stabilizing both magnetic and electric orders. The recent discovery of the magnetoelectric effect in the 2D stripy antiferromagnet CrOCl highlights this semiconductor as a promising platform to explore electric field effects on magnetoresistance. In this study, we systematically investigate the magnetoresistance in tunneling junctions of bilayer and monolayer CrOCl. We observe that the transition from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic phases in both cases induces a positive magnetoresistance at low bias voltages, which reverses to a negative value at higher bias voltages. This polarity reversal is attributed to the additional electric dipoles present in the antiferromagnetic state, as supported by our theoretical calculations. These findings suggest a pathway for the electric control of spintronic devices and underscore the potential of 2D magnets like CrOCl in advancing energy-efficient spintronic applications.

Abstract: Efficiently manipulating the magnetization of van der Waals ferromagnets has attracted considerable interest in developing room-temperature two-dimensional material-based memory and logic devices. Here, taking advantage of the unique properties of the van der Waals ferromagnet as well as promising characteristics of the orbital Hall effect, we demonstrate the room-temperature magnetization switching of van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 through the orbital torque generated by the orbital Hall material, Titanium (Ti). The switching current density is estimated to be around 1.6 x 10^6 A/cm^2, comparable to that achieved in Fe3GaTe2 using spin-orbit torque from spin Hall materials. The efficient magnetization switching arises from the combined effects of the large orbital Hall conductivity of Ti and the strong spin-orbit correlation of the Fe3GaTe2, as confirmed through theoretical calculations. Our findings advance the understanding of orbital torque switching and pave the way for exploring material-based orbitronic devices.

Abstract: The simultaneous application of high magnetic fields and high pressures for controlling magnetic ground states is important for testing our understanding of many-body quantum theory. However, the implementation for neutron scattering experiments presents a technical challenge. To overcome this challenge we present an optimized pressure-cell design with a novel bullet shape, which is compatible with horizontal-field magnets, in particular the high-field magnet operating at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. The cell enabled neutron diffraction and spectroscopy measurements with the combination of three extreme conditions: high pressures, high magnetic fields, and dilution temperatures, simultaneously reaching 0.7 GPa, 25.9 T, and 200 mK. Our results demonstrate the utility of informed material choices and the efficiency of finite-element analysis for future pressure-cell designs to be used in combination with magnetic fields and dilution temperatures for neutron scattering purposes.

# Near- and mid-infrared excitation of ultrafast demagnetization in a cobalt multilayer system

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04892

arXiv:2412.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few decades, ultrafast demagnetization elicited by ultrashort laser pulses has been the subject of a large body of work that aims to better understand and control this phenomenon. Although specific magnetic materials' properties play a key role in defining ultrafast demagnetization dynamics, features of the driving laser pulse such as its duration and photon energy might also contribute. Here, we report ultrafast demagnetization of a cobalt/platinum multilayer in a broad spectral range spanning from the near-infrared (near-IR) to the mid-infrared (mid-IR), with wavelengths between 0.8 and 8.7 $\mu$m. The ultrafast dynamics of the macroscopic magnetization is tracked via the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. We show that the ultrafast demagnetization of the sample can be efficiently induced over that entire excitation spectrum with minimal dependence on the excitation wavelength. Instead, we confirm that the temporal profile of the pump excitation pulse is an important factor influencing ultrafast demagnetization dynamics.

# Dynamics of Aggregation Processes and Electrophysical Properties of Transformer Oil-Based Magnetic Fluids

arXiv:2412.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fluids exhibit tunable structures and electrophysical properties, making them promising for adaptive optical systems, biomedical sensors, and microelectromechanical devices. However, the dynamic evolution of their microstructure under varying magnetic fields remains insufficiently explored.
  This study investigates the structural and dielectric properties of transformer oil-based magnetic fluids containing 0.2-10 vol% magnetite nanoparticles, across a frequency range of 20 Hz to 10 MHz. Particular attention is given to the dynamics of aggregate reorientation in response to alternating magnetic fields. Experimental results demonstrate that low nanoparticle concentrations lead to a linear increase in dielectric permittivity and conductivity, consistent with the Maxwell-Wagner model. In contrast, higher concentrations exhibit conductivity saturation and dispersion effects due to the formation of elongated aggregates.
  An analysis based on the Boyle polarization model describes the relaxation and structural changes associated with aggregation dynamics. Changes in the magnetic field orientation induce aggregate reconfiguration and significant structural transformations. At early stages, elongated chains form, subsequently thickening until an equilibrium state is reached. Elevated temperatures accelerate these processes by reducing medium viscosity and aggregate order.
  The findings highlight the critical role of reorientation dynamics in designing high-speed magnetic sensors, vibration isolation systems, and adaptive devices operating in dynamic magnetic environments.

Abstract: When exploring new magnetic materials, the effect of alloying plays a crucial role for numerous properties. By altering the alloy composition, it is possible to tailor, e.g., the Curie temperature ($T_\text{C}$). In this work, $T_\text{C}$ of various alloys is investigated using a previously developed technique [Br\"{a}nnvall et al. Phys. Rev. Mat. (2024)] designed for robust predictions of $T_\text{C}$ across diverse chemistries and structures. The technique is based on density functional theory calculations and utilizes the energy difference between the magnetic ground state and the magnetically disordered paramagnetic state. It also accounts for the magnetic entropy in the paramagnetic state and the number of nearest magnetic neighbors. The experimentally known systems, Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$V$_x$, NiMnSb-based Heusler alloys, Ti$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$N, and Co$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ are investigated. The experimentally unexplored system Fe$_{1-x}$Tc$_x$ is also tested to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed method in guiding future experimental efforts. This work demonstrates the broad applicability of the developed method across various systems, requiring less hands-on adjustments compared to other theoretical approaches.

# Spin and Orbital Rashba effects at the Ni/HfO$_2$ interface

arXiv:2412.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the giant ferroelectric control of interfacial properties of Ni/HfO2, namely, (i) the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and (ii) the inverse spin and orbital Rashba effects. The reversible control of magnetic properties using electric gating is a promising route to low-energy consumption magnetic devices, including memories and logic gates. Synthetic multiferroics, composed of a ferroelectric in proximity to a magnet, stand out as a promising platform for such devices. Using a combination of $ab$ $initio$ simulations and transport calculations, we demonstrate that reversing the electric polarization modulates the interface magnetocrystalline anisotropy from in-plane to out-of-plane. This modulation compares favorably with recent reports obtained upon electromigration induced by ionic gating. In addition, we find that the current-driven spin and orbital densities at the interface can be modulated by about 50% and 30%, respectively. This giant modulation of the spin-charge and orbit-charge conversion efficiencies opens appealing avenues for voltage-controlled spin- and orbitronics devices.

arXiv:2412.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically the ability to control non-relativistic magnonic and electronic spin splitting by manipulating phonon modes. Using MnF$_2$ as a representative material, exhibiting non-relativistic spin splitting in its electronic bands, we identify an equivalent $d$-wave splitting in magnon modes of specific handedness. Our study reveals a direct correlation between magnonic and electronic splittings, showing that the energy splitting in both magnon and electronic bands can be tuned by jointly modulating the A$_{2u}$ and A$_{1g}$ phonon modes with frequencies of 8.52 and 9.74 THz, respectively. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in spin-split antiferromagnets, offering new pathways for phonon-driven control in magnonic applications.

Abstract: Ferromagnetism and electrical insulation are often at odds, signifying an inherent trade off. The simultaneous optimization of both in one material, essential for advancing spintronics and topological electronics, necessitates the individual manipulation over various degrees of freedom of strongly correlated electrons. Here, by selective control of the spin exchange and Coulomb interactions, we report the achievement of SrFeO2 thin films with resistivity above 106 Ohm.cm and strong magnetization with Curie temperature extrapolated to be 1200 K. Robust ferromagnetism is obtained down to 1.0 nm thickness on substrate and 2.0 nm for freestanding films. Featuring an out of plane oriented ripple infinite layer structure, this ferromagnetic insulating phase is obtained through extensive reduction of as grown brownmillerite SrFeO2.5 films at high compressive strains. Pronounced spin Hall magnetoresistance signals up to 0.0026 is further demonstrated with a Pt Hall bar device. Our findings promise emerging spintronic and topological electronic functionalities harnessing spin dynamics with minimized power dissipations.

Abstract: We consider a coupling element based on a symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and show that it mediates a two-photon interaction. This and other inductive interactions can be switched off in situ. We derive the system Hamiltonian for coupled resonator and rf SQUID. The rf SQUID dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of energy states and acts as an artificial atom. We discuss how the Josephson symmetry breaks owing to magnetic fields in the superconducting loops. We assess that the two-photon coupling strength reaches 18 MHz which can exceed the single-photon capacitive interaction in the coupler.

## 超净II型超导体的振荡磁场相关临界温度

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05111

arXiv:2412.05111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of the Zeeman energy and the Landau levels (LLs) arising from an applied magnetic field ${\bf B}$ upon the critical temperature $T_c$ is studied using a fully quantum mechanical method within the framework of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity that forms from an ultraclean metal. As in semiclassical treatments, we found that two electrons can form Cooper pairs with opposite spins and momenta in the ${\bf B}$ direction while either in the same or in neighboring LLs. However, the fully quantum mechanical treatment of the LLs causes $T_c({\bf B})$ for electrons paired on the same LL to oscillate about the critical temperature of the BCS theory, similar to that of the de Haas-van Alphen effect. The Zeeman energy causes $T_c({\bf B})$ to decrease in an oscillatory fashion with increasing ${\bf B}$ for electrons paired either on the same or on neighboring LLs. For the Zeeman $g > 1$, pairing on neighboring LLs results in the highest $T_c({\bf B})$. For $g < 1$, pairing on the same LLs gives the highest $T_c({\bf B})$. In addition, $T_c({\bf B})$ for electrons paired on neighboring LLs exhibits an apparent symmetry around $g=2$, as the oscillatory critical temperature behaviors are nearly identical for $g=2\pm\delta$.

arXiv:2412.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a non-centrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its non-centrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirms that its structure is non-centrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.

We restrict the magnetic group to its subgroup of elements that act complex linearly, and we show that this restriction induces a rational isomorphism with the conjugation invariant part of the complex equivariant K-theory of the restricted group. This isomorphism allows to calculate the torsion free part of the magnetic equivariant K-theory groups reducing it to known calculations in complex equivariant K-theory

Abstract: Surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic waves that propagate along metal-dielectric interfaces, with important applications in sensing, energy, and nanotechnology. While the behavior of SPPs in single metal slabs is well understood, the coupling between plasmon modes in multilayer systems has received less attention. In this paper, we explore the response functions of SPPs in single-slab, double-slab, and two-different-slab systems using the jellium model. Thanks to a comparison with classical models, our study reveals how quantum effects influence the resonance frequencies of these modes. It also details the spatial description of the different SPP modes and unveils how their coupling occurs in two-different-slab systems. These findings provide new insights into the behavior of SPPs, especially in complex nanostructures.

Abstract: We demonstrate that two independent spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg trimer chains provide an effective platform for the quantum teleportation of any entangled two-qubit state through the quantum communication channel formed by two Heisenberg dimers. The reliability of this quantum channel is assessed by comparing the concurrences, which quantify a strength of the bipartite entanglement of the initial input state and the readout output state. Additionally, we rigorously calculate quantities fidelity and average fidelity to evaluate the quality of the teleportation protocol depending on temperature and magnetic field. It is evidenced that the efficiency of quantum teleportation of arbitrary entangled two-qubit state through this quantum communication channel can be significantly enhanced by moderate magnetic fields. This enhancement can be attributed to the magnetic-field-driven transition from a quantum antiferromagnetic phase to a quantum ferrimagnetic phase, which supports realization of a fully entangled quantum channel suitable for efficient quantum teleportation. The polymeric trimer chains Cu3(P2O6OH)2 are proposed as an experimental resource of this quantum communication channel, which provides an efficient platform for realization of the quantum teleportation up to moderate temperatures 40 K and extremely high magnetic fields 80 T.

Abstract: Kagome metals show rich competing quantum phases due to geometry frustration, flat bands, many-body effects, and non-trivial topology. Recently, a novel charge density wave (CDW) was discovered deep inside the antiferromagnetic phase of FeGe, attracting intense attention due to close relation with magnetism. Here, via a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), we find the 2*2 CDW in FeGe is very fragile and can be readily disrupted into the initial 1*1 phase; Small sqrt3*sqrt3 CDW puddles are found to coexist with the 2*2 CDW in as-grown samples, and can also be induced in the intermediate process of CDW disruption, which will eventually transform into the initial 1*1 phase. Moreover, an exotic intermediate CDW state and standalone CDW nuclei appear unexpectedly during the disruption process. Our first-principle calculations find equal softening of a flat optical phonon mode in a large momentum region around the CDW wave vector, corresponding to numerous competing CDWs with close energies. This might lead to strong instability of the CDW ground state, responsible for STM observations. Our findings provide more novel experimental aspects to understand the CDW in FeGe and suggest FeGe-like Kagome metals are ideal platforms for studying the physics of competing CDW instabilities.

Furthermore, we report spin Hall magnetoresistance in a vdW AFM-based device and study the field and temperature dependence. These findings highlight the transformative potential of vdW AFMs in advancing the field of spin-based technologies.

Abstract: Supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we propose that a {\it nonlinear} superconducting magnetoelectric (NSM) effect can naturally manifest in magnet/superconductor heterostructures. In such platforms, NSM manifests as the spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM survives centrosymmetry and is the leading order magnetic response in a variety of magnetic materials that include both collinear magnets [e.g., $d$-wave planar altermagnet thin film/superconductor (ALM/SC)] as well as noncollinear magnets (e.g., Kagome/SC systems). This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in magnet/superconductor heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.

arXiv:2410.00820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions and antiferromagnetic bimerons that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity. Skyrmionic textures serve as generators of orbital currents that can transport information and give rise to considerable orbital torques.

A compact double-species Zeeman slower consisting of four interleaving helical coils allows for a fast-switching between two optimized configurations for either Li or Cs and provides an efficient sequential loading into their respective MOTs.

Highly stable magnetic fields allow high-resolution atom-loss spectroscopy and enable to resolve splitting in the loss feature of a few tens of milligauss. These features allowed for a detailed study of the Efimov effect.

Abstract: In this work we established the relationship between the crystalline structure symmetry, point defects and possible appearance of the ferroelectric-like polarization in HfO2-y nanoparticles. Notably, that XRD and EPR analysis revealed the formation of the ferroelectric-like orthorhombic phase in the oxygen-deficient HfO2-y nanoparticles (pure and doped with rare-earth element yttrium). DFT calculations showed that small HfO2 nanoparticles may become polar, especially in the presence of impurity atoms and/or oxygen vacancies. To explain the experimental results, we have modified the effective LGD model through the parameterization approach, focusing on the Landau expansion coefficients associated with the polar (FE) and antipolar (AFE) orderings, which agrees with the performed DFT calculations. The effective LGD model can be useful for the development of the novel generation of silicon-compatible ferroelectric nanomaterials based on the HfxZr1-xO2-y.

Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths leading to higher TMR effects and better MTJ devices.

# Magnetically-controlled Vortex Dynamics in a Ferromagnetic Superconductor

arXiv:2412.04098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of $\sim$25 K, is a unique material that exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{FM} \approx 19$ K. The interplay between the two leads to a narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and the spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure directly controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ we observe a pronounced temperature-dependent peak in both the coercivity and the creep activation energy, the latter becoming rapidly suppressed in large applied magnetic fields. We attribute this behaviour to the formation of vortex polarons arising from the unique interaction between free vortices and magnetic stripe domains. We present a theoretical description of the properties of vortex polarons that explains our main observations, showing how they lead to vortex trapping and an attractive vortex-vortex interaction at short distances. In stark contrast, strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures is linked to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work reveals unexplored new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with particularly important applications in high-current conductors for operation at high magnetic fields.

Abstract: Dense lattices of photonic crystals can serve as artificial materials, with light propagation in these structures described by effective material parameters that surpass the capabilities of natural materials. In this study, we introduce a metamaterial that supports quadrupole magnetization, a characteristic rarely observed in existing structures. We experimentally demonstrate a magnetic quadrupole metamaterial associated with Mie-resonance-excited stop bands below the Bragg band. Additionally, we develop a theoretical model that addresses both dispersion and boundary conditions within this framework. Using a Fabry-Perot resonator as a case study, we validate our model and reveal that the quadrupole metamaterial can exhibit a markedly different reflection/transmission spectrum, including zero reflection at normal incidence. Our findings underscore the practical potential for both experimental and theoretical investigations of metamaterials that extend beyond the dipole approximation.

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful diagnostic tool for assessing cardiac structure and function. Traditional breath-held imaging protocols, however, pose challenges for patients with arrhythmias or limited breath-holding capacity. We introduce Motion-Guided Deep Image prior (M-DIP), a novel unsupervised reconstruction framework for accelerated real-time cardiac MRI. M-DIP employs a spatial dictionary to synthesize a time-dependent template image, which is further refined using time-dependent deformation fields that model cardiac and respiratory motion. Unlike prior DIP-based methods, M-DIP simultaneously captures physiological motion and frame-to-frame content variations, making it applicable to a wide range of dynamic applications. We validate M-DIP using simulated MRXCAT cine phantom data as well as free-breathing real-time cine and single-shot late gadolinium enhancement data from clinical patients. Comparative analyses against state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches demonstrate M-DIP's performance and versatility. M-DIP achieved better image quality metrics on phantom data, as well as higher reader scores for in-vivo patient data.

Abstract: The kinetic stability of collisionless, sloshing beam-ion (45{\deg} pitch angle) plasma is studied in a 3D simple magnetic mirror, mimicking the Wisconsin High-temperature superconductor Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM) experiment. The collisional Fokker-Planck code CQL3D-m provides a slowing-down beam-ion distribution to initialize the kinetic-ion/fluid-electron code Hybrid-VPIC, which then simulates free plasma decay without external heating or fueling. Over 1-10 $\mu$s, drift-cyclotron loss-cone (DCLC) modes grow and saturate in amplitude. DCLC scatters ions to a marginally-stable distribution with gas-dynamic rather than classical-mirror confinement. Sloshing ions can trap cool (low-energy) ions in an electrostatic potential well to stabilize DCLC, but DCLC itself does not scatter sloshing beam-ions into said well. Instead, cool ions must come from external sources such as charge-exchange collisions with a low-density neutral population. Manually adding cool ~1 keV ions improves beam-ion confinement ~2-5x in Hybrid-VPIC simulations, which qualitatively corroborates measurements from real mirror devices with sloshing ions.

arXiv:2412.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have carried out a two-dimensional (2D) simulation of thermal instability (TI) in interstellar matter (ISM), considering it to be a weakly ionized inviscid plasma with radiation loss. We carry out the simulation with the help of our multi-fluid flux-corrected transport (mFCT) code which incorporates a background magnetic field and anisotropic pressure. The anisotropic pressure is modeled with a polybaric pressure model (Stasiewicz 2004). We find that the resultant turbulent state of the interstellar matter (ISM), driven purely by time-dependent heating and cooling with polybaric pressure is similar in nature to the one driven by external forcing such as by supernova feedback. This demonstrates the universal nature of the turbulence in ISM, which is largely isobaric and incompressible. The findings of our analysis is consistent with the contemporary status of knowledge about the multiphase nature of the ISM with volume and mass fractions of the various components of the ISM that is warm, cold, and unstable neutral matter (UNM) in the ranges reported by various numerical and observational analysis.Though the strength of the background magnetic field only marginally affects the overall evolution, the ratio of the parallel and perpendicular pressures can considerably alter the mass and volume fractions of the three phases, which can affect the overall evolution of the TI in the long run.

# Light-induced magnetic trapping for cold alkali atoms using a combined optical tweezers and nanofibre platform

arXiv:2412.04809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.

# Stochastic modeling of blob-like plasma filaments in the scrape-off layer: Time-dependent velocities and pulse stagnation

## 刮离层中斑点状等离子体细丝的随机建模: 时间相关的速度和脉冲停滞

arXiv:2412.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic model for a super-position of uncorrelated pulses with a random distribution of and correlations between amplitudes and velocities is analyzed. The pulses are assumed to move radially with fixed shape and amplitudes decreasing exponentially in time due to linear damping. The pulse velocities are taken to be time-dependent with a power law dependence on the instantaneous amplitudes, as suggested by blob velocity scaling theories. In accordance with experimental measurements, the pulse function is assumed to be exponential and the amplitudes are taken to be exponentially distributed. As a consequence of linear damping and time-dependent velocities, it is demonstrated that the pulses stagnate during their radial motion. This makes the average pulse waiting time increase radially outwards in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined plasmas. In the case that pulse velocities are proportional to their amplitudes, the mean value of the process decreases exponentially with radial coordinate, similar to the case when all pulses have the same, time-independent velocity. The profile e-folding length is then given by the product of the average pulse velocity and the parallel transit time. Moreover, both the average pulse amplitude and the average velocity are the same at all radial positions due to stagnation of slow and small-amplitude pulses. In general, an increasing average pulse velocity results in a flattened radial profile of the mean value of the process as well as a higher relative fluctuation level, strongly enhancing plasma-surface interactions.

Abstract: The propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas in a state where a global mode has been established or is in turbulence, are of theoretical and experimental interest in thermonuclear fusion research. Interpreting experimental results, as well as predicting plasma behavior requires the numerical solutions of the underlying physics, that is, the numerical solution of Maxwell equations under various initial conditions and, under the circumstances, complex boundary conditions. Casting, the underlying equations in a coordinate free form that exploits the symmetries and the conserved quantities in a form that can easily encompass a variety of initial and boundary conditions is of tantamount importance. Pursuing this task we utilize the advantages the Clifford Algebras can possibly provide. For simplicity we deal with a cold multi-species lossless magnetized plasma. The formulation renders a Dirac type evolution equation for am augmented state that consists of the electric and magnetic field bivectors as well as the polarizations and their associated currents for each species. This evolution equation can be dealt with a general spatial lattice disretization scheme. The evolution operator that dictates the temporal advancement of the state is Hermitian. This formulation is computationally simpler whatever the application could be. However, small wavelength capabilities (on the Debye length scale) for spatially large systems (magnetic confinement devices) is questionable even for conventional super-computers. However, the formulation provided in this work it is entirely suitable and it can be directly transferred in a quantum computer. It is shown that the simplified problem in the present work could be suitable for contemporary rudimentary quantum computers.

arXiv:2412.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic waves that propagate along metal-dielectric interfaces, with important applications in sensing, energy, and nanotechnology. While the behavior of SPPs in single metal slabs is well understood, the coupling between plasmon modes in multilayer systems has received less attention. In this paper, we explore the response functions of SPPs in single-slab, double-slab, and two-different-slab systems using the jellium model. Thanks to a comparison with classical models, our study reveals how quantum effects influence the resonance frequencies of these modes. It also details the spatial description of the different SPP modes and unveils how their coupling occurs in two-different-slab systems. These findings provide new insights into the behavior of SPPs, especially in complex nanostructures.

# Penetrative rotating magnetoconvection subject to lateral variations in temperature gradients

arXiv:2412.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection-driven flows in planetary interiors exhibit rich dynamics owing to multiple spatio-temporally varying forcing conditions and physical constraints. In particular, the churning of liquid metals in the Earth's outer core, responsible for the dynamic geomagnetic field, is subjected to lower mantle thermal heterogeneity. Besides, the plausible existence of a stable stratification layer below the mantle influences the columnar convection. These additional symmetry-breaking constraints, motivated from geophysical scenario of the Earth's thermal core--mantle interaction, modulate the otherwise periodic and axially invariant convection flow patterns. Thus, the present study focuses on qualitative characterization and parametric quantification of rotating penetrative convection in the presence of magnetic induction effects with an aim to understand the role of the lower mantle on core convection thermally. Using complementing computational and theoretical calculations, the present study estimates the depth of penetration in bounded and unbounded fluid domains. Apart from qualitative differences in convective flow patterns from the reference homogeneous configurations, the additional constraints spatially modulate the extent of penetration into stable regions. Confinement effects, adding to the damping of penetrative convection, arising out of boundary constraints are quantified for bounded geometry. Appropriate normalizations, implemented to eliminate such effects, result in amended penetration depth estimates that align with the qualitative characteristics obtained for unbounded domains. Exact closed-form expressions for the depth of penetration are obtained, providing insights into the role of individual contributions of multiple physical constraints. Implications are speculated for realistic, yet unreachable, regimes of geophysical conditions of planetary cores.

# A simple model for longitudinal electron transport during and after laser excitation: Emergence of electron resistive transport

arXiv:2412.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-driven electron transport across a sample has garnered enormous attentions over several decades, as it provides a much faster way to control electron dynamics. Light is an electromagnetic wave, so how and why an electron can acquire a longitudinal velocity remains unanswered. Here we show that it is the magnetic field that steers the electron to the light propagation direction. But, quantitatively, our free-electron model is still unable to reproduce the experimental velocities. Going beyond the free electron mode and assuming the system absorbs all the photon energy, the theoretical velocity matches the experimental observation. We introduce a concept of the resistive transport, where electrons deaccelerate under a constant resistance after laser excitation. This theory finally explains why the experimental distance-versus-time forms a down-concave curve, and unifies ballistic and superdiffusive transports into a single resistive transport. We expect that our finding will motivate further investigations.

# Impact of Two-Population $\alpha$-particle Distributions on Plasma Stability

## 两种群 $ \ alpha $ 粒子分布对血浆稳定性的影响

arXiv:2412.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of weakly collisional plasmas is well represented by linear theory, and the generated waves play an essential role in the thermodynamics of these systems. The velocity distribution functions (VDF) characterizing kinetic particle behavior are commonly represented as a sum of anisotropic bi-Maxwellians. For the majority of in situ observations of solar wind plasmas enabled by heliospheric missions, a three bi-Maxwellian model is commonly applied for the ions, assuming that the VDF consists of a proton core, proton beam, and a single He ($\alpha$) particle population, each with their own density, bulk velocity, and anisotropic temperature. Resolving an $\alpha$-beam component was generally not possible due to instrumental limitations. The Solar Orbiter Solar Wind Analyser Proton and Alpha Sensor (SWA PAS) resolves velocity space with sufficient coverage and accuracy to routinely characterize secondary $\alpha$ populations consistently. This design makes the SWA PAS dataset ideal for examining effects of the $\alpha$-particle beam on the plasma's kinetic stability. We test the wave signatures observed in the magnetic field power spectrum at ion scales and compare them to the predictions from linear plasma theory, Doppler-shifted into the spacecraft reference frame. We find that taking into account the $\alpha$-particle beam component is necessary to predict the coherent wave signatures in the observed power spectra, emphasizing the importance of separating the $\alpha$-particle populations as is traditionally done for protons. Moreover, we demonstrate that the drifts of beam components are responsible for the majority of the modes that propagate in oblique direction to the magnetic field, while their temperature anisotropies are the primary source of parallel Fast Magnetosonic Modes in the solar wind.

arXiv:2112.01193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic helicity, and more broadly magnetic field line topology, impose constraints on the plasma dynamics. Helically interlocked magnetic rings are in a non-trivial topological state. It is harder to bring them into a topologically trivial state than two rings that are not linked. This particular restriction has the consequence that helical plasmas exhibit increased stability in laboratory devices, in the Sun and in the intergalactic medium. Here we discuss how a magnetic field is stabilizing the plasma and preventing it from disruption by the presence of magnetic helicity. We present observational results, numerical experiments and analytical results that illustrate how helical magnetic fields strongly contribute to the long-term stability of some plasmas. We discuss several cases, such as that of solar corona, toroidal fusion devices, the galactic and extragalactic medium, with a special emphasis on extragalactic bubbles.

arXiv:2412.02812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths leading to higher TMR effects and better MTJ devices.

arXiv:2412.03288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous theories have postulated the existence of exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Spin-based quantum sensors, which utilize the quantum properties of spins to enhance measurement precision, emerge as powerful tools for probing these exotic interactions. These sensors encompass a wide range of technologies, such as optically pumped magnetometers, atomic comagnetometers, spin masers, nuclear magnetic resonance, spin amplifiers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These technologies stand out for their ultrahigh sensitivity, compact tabletop design, and cost-effectiveness, offering complementary approaches to the large-scale particle colliders and astrophysical observations. This article reviews the underlying physical principles of various spin sensors and highlights the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with these quantum sensors. Investigations covered include the exotic interactions of spins with ultralight dark matter, exotic spin-dependent forces, electric dipole moment, spin-gravity interactions, and among others. Ongoing and forthcoming experiments using advanced spin-based sensors to investigate exotic spin-dependent interactions are discussed.

# Capturing and labeling CO2 in a jar: Mechanochemical 17O-Enrichment and ssNMR study of Sodium and Potassium (bi)carbonate Salts

With the rapid increase in temperatures around the planet, the need to develop efficient means to reduce CO2 emissions has become one of the greatest challenges of the scientific community. Many different strategies are being studied worldwide, one of which consists in trapping the gas into porous materials, either for its short- or long-term capture and storage, or its re-use for the production of value-added compounds. Yet, to further the development of such systems, there is a real need to fully understand their structure and properties, including at the molecular-level following the physisorption and/or chemisorption of CO2 (which can lead to various species, including carbonate and bicarbonate ions). In this context, 17O NMR naturally appears as the analytical tool of choice, because of its exquisite sensitivity to probe subtle differences in oxygen bonding environments. To date, it has scarcely been used, due to the very low natural abundance of 17O (0.04%), and the absence of commercially available 17O-labeled compounds adapted to such investigations (e.g., 17O-CO2(g), or 17O-enriched Na- and K- (bi)carbonate salts, which can be readily transformed into CO2). Herein, we demonstrate how, using mechanochemistry, it is possible to enrich with 17O a variety of Na- and K- (bi)carbonate salts in a fast, economical, scalable, and user-friendly way. The high enrichment levels enabled recording the first high-resolution 17O ssNMR spectra of these phases at different temperatures and magnetic fields. From these, the typical spectral signatures of (bi)carbonate ions could be obtained, showing their strong sensitivity to local dynamics. Lastly, we show how thanks to the selective 17O-labeling, singular aspects of the reactivity of carbonates in materials can be unveiled using in-situ 17O ssNMR. In the long run, it is expected that this work will open the way to more profound investigations of the structure and properties of carbon capture and storage systems, and, more generally speaking, of functional materials containing carbonates.

# Heterometallic CuCd and Cu2Zn complexes with o-vanillin and its Schiff base derivative: slow magnetic relaxation and catalytic activity associated with Cu(II) centers

In this work, two novel heterometallic mixed-ligand mixed-anion complexes [CuIICdIIClL(o-Van)(OAc)]·3H2O (1) and [CuII2ZnIICl2L2(o-Van)(OAc)] (2) were prepared by reacting a fine copper powder and Cd(II) or Zn(II) acetate with ethanol solution of the Schiff base ligand HL formed in situ in the condensation reaction of 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde (o-VanH) and CH3NH2·HCl. The compounds were thoroughly characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV/Vis and EPR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry as well as single crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing the neutral molecular nature of both compounds. Catalytic properties of 1 and 2 were studied in the oxidation of hydrocarbons with H2O2 under mild conditions, showing the maximum reaction rate of 4 × 10–5 M s–1 and TOF up to 640 h–1. Both compounds undergo complex transformations in solution as evidenced by kinetic analysis and time-dependent UV/Vis spectroscopy, indicating that the reduced Cu(I) form of 1 is unexpectedly unfavorable. Complex 1 demonstrates slow magnetic relaxation dominated by the direct relaxation process between T = 1.8 and 7 K under an external DC field of 0.2 and 0.4 T, a very rarely observable effect in the coordination compounds of Cu(II). Complex 2 possesses weak ferromagnetism (J = 4.50 cm–1, zJ’ = –0.201 cm–1 for H = –JS1S2 formalism) occurring through the Cu–O–Cu pathways. The theoretical CASSCF, DFT and TDDFT calculations were applied to investigate the electronic structures of 1 and 2 and rationalize their behavior in solution.

# Faceted 3D Supercrystals for Plasmonic Photocatalysis: Design, Reactivity and Operando Studies

## 用于等离子体光催化的刻面3D超晶: 设计，反应性和操作研究

Solar-driven plasmonic photocatalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance chemical reactivity, improving the efficiency and selectivity in a large number of transformations. Plasmonic nanoparticles are often implemented in photocatalysis as colloidal dispersions but they face issues related to the reduced photoactivation of the metallic surface in concentrated solutions and poor long-term colloidal stability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce 3D plasmonic supercrystals created through the depletion- and evaporation-induced self-assembly of metal nanoparticles as novel heterogeneous plasmonic photocatalysts. They present large electromagnetic field enhancements associated to the formation of regular arrays of plasmonic hot spots, leading to improved chemical reactivities through the generation of hot charge carriers. To demonstrate this, we chose two challenging organic transformations, an oxidative polymerization and different C‒C cross-coupling reactions, that can be activated by modifying the chemical composition of the assemblies. Interestingly, the anisotropic shapes of the building blocks lead to the formation of 3D supercrystals exposing different crystalline facets. Importantly, by performing operando Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy at the single supercrystal level, we unveil the face-dependent reactivity of each individual plasmonic superstructure. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach provides with key insights into structure-function correlations and offers guidelines for the rational design of versatile supercrystal photocatalysts.

Magnetic and gravity surveys are frequently used by earth scientists, given their ease of use and ability to provide rapid results. Various data platforms have integrated these data obtained from ground, sea, and airborne measurements on a global scale. The combining process reduces data resolution in some cases. In this study, aero and ground magnetic data in the Eastern Pontides were analysed to test this situation. The two magnetic data normalized for comparison show great similarities. It has also been suggested that carrying out ground magnetic survey at intervals of at most 10 km is sufficient for modelling large-scale deep structures. They were also used together with global gravity data to model the crustal structure of the Eastern Pontides. The results were compared with crustal models using gravity and seismological data in the literature. Contrary to the monotonic crustal thickness increase from north to south suggested in the literature, a gravity increase of approximately 50 mGal was determined in the south of the Eastern Pontides (axial zone) and it was suggested that the crust became thinner in this region. In addition, the crustal thickness variation was determined more clearly with the contribution of the two magnetic data sources.

# Identification of the central artery using three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography-magnetic resonance fusion image

## 三维数字减影血管造影-磁共振融合图像识别中央动脉

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5400338/latest

Purpose: Conventionally, identification of the central artery involves invasive techniques. This study aimed to evaluate the identification of the central artery on three-dimensional (3D)- and two-dimensional (2D)- digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images based on fusion images created using 3D-DSA and magnetic resonance image (MRI) as a less invasive technique.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 65 cases in which the central sulcus could be detected among the cases that underwent 3D-DSA and high-resolution MRI. We fused 3D-DSA and MRI to identify the central artery on 3D- and 2D-DSA images. To devise an index to identify the central artery using only the 2D-DSA lateral view, we traced each central artery and calculated the distance from several anatomical landmarks. Using the created index, we evaluated the identification rate using or not using the index for three neurosurgical fellows.
Results: We succeeded in fusing 3D-DSA and MRI for all 65 cases. We were able to detect the central artery in 64 (98%) cases in 3D- and 2D-DSA. We created the index of the central artery in the 2D-DSA lateral view in the range of 12 to 60 mm dorsally from the intersection of the straight line connecting the anterior skull base and the internal occipital prominence with the vertical line drawn down from the coronal suture. Comparing using and not using this index, the identification rate of the central artery improved using the index.
Conclusion: 3DDSA-MR fusion images are useful for identifying the central artery with less invasiveness compared to conventional methods.

Purpose: This study evaluated inter-/intra-reader agreement with PI-RADS version 2.1 to improve the detection rate of prostate cancer.
Methods: We enrolled 210 patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for clinically suspected or diagnosed prostate cancer. Four readers, including two urologists, viewed patients&rsquo; mpMRI and scored PI-RADS between two sessions. Inter-and intra-reader agreements were evaluated using Fleiss's Kappa coefficient (&kappa;), agreement coefficient 1 (AC1), and percentage of agreement(PA).
Results: The overall inter-reader agreement between all readers was moderate (&kappa;=0.466, AC1=0.522, and PA=0.610). The overall inter-reader agreement improved in the second session. The agreement for peripheral zone (PZ) lesions was higher than that for transitional zone (TZ) lesions. At a PI-RADS cut-off of 4, the agreement for PZ lesions was almost perfect (PA=0.888) and higher than that for TZ lesions. The inter-reader agreement for lesions with a PI-RADS &ge; 4 and Gleason score &ge; 7 was almost perfect (AC1=0.960 and PA=0.964). The intra-reader agreement for lesions overall and PI-RADS &ge; 4 lesions were substantial(AC1=0.601) and almost perfect (PA=0.876), respectively.
Conclusion: Readers achieved moderate agreement for PI-RADS version 2.1 and benefitted from training sessions. Feedback, training, and multidisciplinary discussions also improved inter-reader agreement. Our study can provide guidance, updates, and further steps for the standardization and improvement of PI-RADS scoring.

Gas therapy represents a promising strategy for cancer treatment, with nitric oxide (NO) therapy showing particular potential in tumor therapy. However, ensuring sufficient production of NO remains a significant challenge. In this study, we successfully constructed ultrasound-responsive nanoparticles, which consisted of poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, natural L-arginine (LA), and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO, Fe3O4 NPs), denote as Fe3O4-LA-PLGA NPs. The Fe3O4-LA-PLGA NPs exhibited effective therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, particularly in NO-assisted antitumor gas therapy and dual-modality imaging properties. Upon exposure to ultrasound irradiation, LA and Fe3O4 NPs were rapidly released from the PLGA NPs. It was demonstrated that LA could spontaneously react with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) present in the tumor microenvironment to generate NO for gas therapy. Concurrently, Fe3O4 NPs could rapidly react with H2O2 to produce a substantial quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can oxidize LA to further facilitate the release of NO. In conclusion, the proposed ultrasound-responsive NO delivery platform exhibits significant potential in effectively inhibiting the growth of breast cancer.

# The Utility of Endoscopic Ultrasound in Detecting Missed CBD stones

## 超声内镜在检测漏诊的CBD结石中的应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5152065/latest

Background: Precise techniques for identifying common bile duct (CBD) and pancreatic disorders are crucial to strategize appropriate interventions. This study aimed to assess the utility of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in detecting CBD stones compared to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
Methods: This prospective &amp;nbsp;multicenter research included 200 patients over 18 years old with dilated CBD measuring 6-10 mm, unexplained elevated liver enzymes, and unexplained acute pancreatitis. The patients were evaluated using abdominal ultrasonography, MRCP, and EUS.
MRCP is performed just before the EUS and the ERCP being performed at a subsequent stage whenever indicated.
Results: Stones were detected in 39.5% of the patients using ERCP compared to 47% using MRCP and 43.5% using EUS. There was a strong agreement between ERCP findings and EUS findings (Kappa=0.837). EUS can significantly detect stones with a sensitivity of 94.9%, specificity of 90.1%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 86.2%, Negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.5%, and accuracy of 92%. There was a moderate agreement between ERCP findings and MRCP findings (Kappa=0.402). MRCP can significantly detect stones with a sensitivity of 72.2%, specificity of 69.4%, PPV of 60.6%, NPV of 79.2%, and accuracy of 70.5%. The accuracy of EUS was significantly higher than accuracy of MRCP.
Conclusions: EUS is a more accurate diagnostic tool for detecting stones compared to MRCP, and it has a strong agreement with ERCP findings, which is considered the gold standard??

Background The impact of septal myectomy on the progression of ascending aortic (AAo) dilation in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM) remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between septal myectomy and AAo dilation in HOCM patients.
Methods A total of 69 patients with HOCM were enrolled. All the participants underwent sequential cardiac magnetic resonance scans at a mean interval of 5.13 &plusmn; 2.04 years, with each scan being more than 3 years apart.
Results At baseline, 17 patients with HOCM (25%) exhibited AAo dilation (Indexed AAo dimension&amp;gt; 19 mm/m&sup2;). Age (OR 1.10, 95%CI: 1.01-1.019, P = 0.026) and female (OR 4.80, 95%CI: 1.05-21.93, P = 0.043) were identified as independent risk factors for AAo dilation. In patients who underwent myectomy, the AAo dimension at follow-up was similar to that at baseline (32.47 &plusmn; 4.70mm vs. 32.81 &plusmn; 5.06mm, P=0.197). Furthermore, the rate of AAo dilation was lowere in patients with myectomy compared to those without myectomy (-0.06 &plusmn; 0.38mm/year vs. 0.18 &plusmn; 0.43mm/year, P=0.016). Additionally, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was significantly associated with AAo dilation rate (B=0.273, P=0.032).
Conclusions These findings suggest that surgical myectomy may help prevent AAo dilation in patients with HOCM.

# Comparing  the Performance of IRI-2020 and AfriTEC Ionospheric Models Over East Africa In Case Of Ethiopia During Disturbed Time

## 在埃塞俄比亚的情况下，东非IRI-2020和aferitec电离层模型在受干扰时间内的性能比较

This study evaluates the performance of IRI-2020 and AfriTEC ionospheric models in predicting Total Electron Content (TEC) variations during geomagnetically disturbed time over East Africa in the case of Ethiopia. In equatorial places like Ethiopia, the geomagnetic disturbance of the ionosphere can cause significant changes during disturbed time, which could lead to inaccurate position and timing data in satellite navigation and communication systems. For Ethiopian sectoral radio long-distance transmission, it is significant that the electron density can fluctuate diurnally, monthly and seasonally due to variations in the height and peak density of the F-region. To minimize this problem, we use the IRI-2020 model, the AfriTEC model, and GPS-TEC data. The IRI-2020 model data predicted from the instant run version, the AfriTEC model data predicated MatLab toolbox, and GPS-derived TEC data were obtained from the IGS network of ground-based dual-frequency GPS receivers from five Ethiopian sectors. By using geomagnetic parameters from Omniweb data sources, particularly the DST index ranging from -70 to 20 nT for 2016. The results show a consistent daily and monthly correlation between the estimated TEC from both models and the GPS-TEC, with notable seasonal variations. While the models demonstrated good agreement across all seasons, discrepancies were observed in December and June. Seasonal equinox and solstice periods were particularly analyzed, with AfriTEC showing an overestimation of TEC by 3 to 50 TECU in April, yet having a lower root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.36 compared to IRI-2020. Finally, the diurnal, monthly, seasonal statistical RMSE values indicate that the IRI-2020 RMSE is a maximum error and the AfriTEC RMSE is the minimum error value. Therefore, the evidence shows that the AfriTEC ionospheric model gives a better prediction of the TEC at Ethiopian sectors and shows its superior performance in capturing ionospheric behavior during disturbed periods.

# Comprehensive characterization of solar wind interaction with lunar crustal magnetic fields: Kaguya low-altitude observations

## 太阳风与月球地壳磁场相互作用的综合表征: Kaguya低空观测

Although the Moon does not have a global intrinsic magnetic field, lunar crustal magnetic anomalies (LMAs) are nonuniformly distributed over the lunar surface. The interaction between the solar wind and LMAs leads to the formation of mini-magnetospheres. Since the spatial scales of LMAs are very small, below several tens of kilometers, solar wind ions are demagnetized while electrons are still magnetized, forming Hall electric fields typically at low altitudes (~30 km). Since direct observations of these interaction regions are challenging from typical nominal altitudes of lunar orbiters (~100 km), the solar wind-LMA interaction has not been fully understood. In this study, we analyze low-altitude data obtained by Kaguya over various LMAs to comprehensively characterize the plasma environment and electromagnetic fields in the solar wind-LMA interaction region. We observe strong solar wind ion reflection and whistler mode waves at 1&ndash;10 Hz under high solar wind dynamic pressure and strong interplanetary magnetic field conditions, respectively. These trends are particularly clear over spatially extended LMAs. Over both spatially isolated and extended LMAs, strong Broadband Electrostatic Noise at 1&ndash;10 kHz tends to be observed when the spacecraft is magnetically connected to the lunar surface. In addition, our results suggest that anti-moonward electrostatic fields at low altitudes contribute to the acceleration, deceleration, and reflection of incident solar wind particles, and the resulting modification of particle velocity distribution functions can strongly influence the nature of the solar wind-LMA interaction including plasma wave excitation. Based on Kaguya data, we also develop a predictable indicator of the central interaction region where solar wind ions and electrons are decoupled. We propose that this indicator can be utilized to define regions of interest for future low-altitude or lander missions to LMA.

# Highly Shape-Morphable Origami Electromagnetic Waveguides

## 高度可变形的折纸电磁波导

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5530039/latest

Electromagnetic waveguides are used extensively in spacecraft, naval, electrical, and communication systems for transferring microwave energy from one point to another. Current electromagnetic waveguides are typically rigid, bulky structures with no or minimal shape adaptability. This construction poses challenges in using electromagnetic waveguides in highly confined spaces or systems requiring small storage volumes and high shape adaptability. This work reports a novel concept of highly shape-morphable origami electromagnetic waveguides that can fold, deploy, and change shapes. This research explores multiple designs inspired by origami folding techniques, including shopping bags and bellows designs. The numerical and experimental studies indicate that the origami waveguides exhibit low-loss, robust microwave energy transmission. These results demonstrate that the highly shape-morphable electromagnetic waveguides may effectively replace their rigid counterparts including straight, twisted, and bent waveguides. This research also employs a combined analytical and experimental approach to investigate the kinematics and mechanics of the origami electromagnetic waveguides with a focus on rectangular straight and twist bellows designs. This knowledge provides rigorous guidance for the structural design of origami electromagnetic waveguides. The engineering advancements and fundamental studies in this work lay the foundation for future adaptive microwave energy delivery waveguides.
