Author(s): Paolo G. Radaelli<br /><p>Seventy years after the first experimental observation of antiferromagnetism [Shull et al., Phys. Rev. 83, 333 (1951)], it was generally believed that all fundamental aspects of magnetism had been discovered. Much to everyone’s surprise, a new class of magnets emerged (named “altermagnets”), having antiferromagnetic spin arrangements but also strongly spin-polarized electronic bands – a property usually associated with ferromagnets. This paper analyses the symmetry conditions for the existence of momentum-space spin textures in antiferromagnets, and demonstrates that such textures generally contain a strong “altermagnetic” component, which can exist in the absence of spin-orbit coupling.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRB/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214428.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

Heating plasma to the ultra-high temperatures needed for fusion reactions requires more than turning the dial on a thermostat. Scientists consider multiple methods, one of which involves injecting electromagnetic waves into the plasma, the same process that heats food in microwave ovens. But when they produce one type of heating wave, they can sometimes simultaneously create another type of wave that does not heat the plasma, in effect wasting energy.

Abstract: Elucidating the factors limiting quantum coherence in real materials is essential to the development of quantum technologies. Here we report a strategic approach to determine the effect of lattice dynamics on spin coherence lifetimes using oxygen deficient double perovskites as host materials. In addition to obtaining millisecond $T_1$ spin-lattice lifetimes at T ~ 10 K, measurable quantum superpositions were observed up to room temperature. We determine that $T_2$ enhancement in $Sr_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ over previously studied $Ba_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ is caused by a dynamically-driven increase in effective site symmetry around the dominant paramagnetic site, assigned as $W^{5+}$ via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Further, a combination of experimental and computational techniques enabled quantification of the relative strength of spin-phonon coupling of each phonon mode. This analysis demonstrates the effect of thermodynamics and site symmetry on the spin lifetimes of $W^{5+}$ paramagnetic defects, an important step in the process of reducing decoherence to produce longer-lived qubits.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological features in the charge excitations of Mott insulators in the Chern-Hubbard model. In the strong correlation regime, treating electrons as the sum of holons and doublons excitations, we compute the topological phase diagram of Mott insulators at half-filling using composite operator formalism. The Green function zeros manifest as the tightly bound pairs of such elementary excitations of the Mott insulators. Our analysis examines the winding number associated with the occupied Hubbard bands and the band of Green's function zeros. We show that both the poles and zeros show gapless states and zeros, respectively, in line with bulk-boundary correspondence. The gapless edge states emerge in a junction geometry connecting a topological Mott band insulator and a topological Mott zeros phase. These include an edge electronic state that carries a charge and a charge-neutral gapless zero mode. Our study is relevant to several twisted materials with flat bands where interactions play a dominant role.

Abstract: The nonreciprocity created by dipolar coupling, electric currents, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions is discussed in cases where the magnon propagation direction has a component parallel to the toroidal moment of the magnetization. A criterion for calculating the toroidal moments is established, addressing the issue of correct origin selection based on compensated and uncompensated magnetizations. This criterion is then applied to various nonreciprocal magnetic systems, with the calculations consistent with those reported in the literature and predicting the existence of nonreciprocity in a more general manner. These results broaden the physical significance of the toroidal moment and facilitate the identification and estimation of nonreciprocity in magnonic systems. This work also clarifies the interrelations between different definitions of the toroidal moment for confined structures, where a surface term arising from surface-bound currents connects these definitions without the need for time-averaging. Comparing these definitions of the toroidal moment applied to different magnetic textures demonstrates that they are always parallel but may differ in magnitude and sign. The discrepancy in the different definitions is deemed irrelevant since its direction, rather than its magnitude, primarily predicts the existence of magnon nonreciprocity.

arXiv:2412.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports of colossal negative magnetoresistance (CMR) in a few magnetic semimetals and semiconductors have attracted attention, because these materials are devoid of the conventional mechanisms of CMR such as mixed valence, double exchange interaction, and Jahn-Teller distortion. New mechanisms have thus been proposed, including topological band structure, ferromagnetic clusters, orbital currents, and charge ordering. The CMR in these compounds has been reported in two forms: either a resistivity peak or a resistivity upturn suppressed by a magnetic field. Here we reveal both types of CMR in a single antiferromagnetic semiconductor Eu5In2As6. Using the transport and thermodynamic measurements, we demonstrate that the peak-type CMR is likely due to the percolation of magnetic polarons with increasing magnetic field, while the upturn-type CMR is proposed to result from the melting of a charge order under the magnetic field. We argue that similar mechanisms operate in other compounds, offering a unifying framework to understand CMR in seemingly different materials.

Abstract: On the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass/ferromagnet (FM/SG/FM) structure, the tunneling current is dominated by resistance switch (RS) instead of the local density of states according to the conventional tunneling theory. Here we show lattice-site dependent RS behaviors in one-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3 deposited on single MnBi2Te4 septuple layer, which comes from the difference in the efficiency of tunneling electrons to induce focused current or phonons at different sites, switching remotely the spin valve by spin-transfer torque or spin-phonon interactions. These lead to the observation of the dynamic 2-state lattice when the tip scans across the surface as well as the ability of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to reveal atomic-scale features of electron-phonon (EP) interactions. Our work demonstrates the possibility of the spin-switch STM to image lattice-site dependent EP interactions of any materials deposited on the FM/SG/FM structure.

Abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAWs), coherent vibrational modes localized at solid surfaces, have been employed to manipulate and detect electronic and magnetic states in condensed-matter systems via strain. SAWs are commonly excited in a piezoelectric material, often the substrate. In such systems, SAWs not only generate strain but also electric field at the surface. Conventional analysis of the electric field accompanying the SAW invokes the electrostatic approximation, which may fall short in fully capturing its essential characteristics by neglecting the effect of the magnetic field. Here we study the electric and magnetic fields associated with SAWs without introducing the electrostatic approximation. The plane wave solution takes the form of an evanescent field that decays along the surface normal with a phase velocity equal to the speed of sound. If a metallic film is placed on the piezoelectric substrate, a time- and space-varying electric field permeates into the film with a decay length along the film normal defined by the skin depth and the SAW wavelength. For films with high conductivity, the phase of the electric field varies along the film normal. The emergence of the evanescent field is a direct consequence of dropping the electrostatic approximation, providing a simple but critical physical interpretation of the SAW-induced electromagnetic field.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands (FBs) in breathing Kagome lattices (BKLs), we present a detailed first-principles study of the optical response of single-layer (SL) Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ using the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) method, incorporating self-energy corrections and excitonic effects. Our findings reveal a rich spectrum of strongly bound excitons. The key results are fourfold: (i) SL Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ exhibits a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton ground state with binding energy substantially larger than the GW-renormalized band gap, giving rise to a negative exciton energy peak at $-0.14$ eV and indicating an excitonic Mott insulator phase potentially stable at room temperature ($k_B T = 0.025$ eV); (ii) the brightest exciton peak appears at 1.2 eV, in excellent agreement with experimental optical absorption spectra. (iii) We map the low-energy Frenkel exciton system onto a Hubbard model with spin-1 particles on a triangular lattice, resulting in frustrated spin configurations due to antiferromagnetic spin-spin exchange interaction. (iv) As the spin-triplet Frenkel excitons have electric dipoles that interact with each other via electric dipole-dipole interaction, we obtain antiferroelectric ordering, possibly stable at room temperature. Thus, we propose that Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ is a multiferroic dark spin-triplet excitonic Mott insulator.

Abstract: We consider a half-filled system of spin-1/2 fermions with spin-dependent hopping on a triangular ladder in the presence of spin-dependent flux penetrating the lattice. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an effective spin (pseudospin i.e.\ charge) Hamiltonian describing the infrared properties of the system in the limit of strong on-site repulsion (attraction). The expansion is performed up to the third order in the hopping amplitude over on-site energy. It is shown that the low-energy spin (charge) excitations are described by an anisotropic ${\gamma \geqslant 1}$ $XXZ$ Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and an unconventional three-spin (correlated exchange) term in the presence of an extended magnetic field. The magnetic field couples not only to $z$-projection of the total spin on a triangular plaquette but also to the product of $z$-components of three spins located on vertices of the triangle. In the limiting case of spin-symmetric flux, the magnetic field and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term are absent and the three-spin term reduces to the standard scalar spin chirality term $\sim \mathbf{S}_i \cdot\left[\mathbf{S}_j \times \mathbf{S}_k\right]$. In the case of strong attractive interaction, the corresponding effective model is derived from the repulsive one using the one-spin-component particle-hole transformation. The effective Hamiltonian is given by the same $XXZ$ Heisenberg model, as in the repulsive case, but in terms of pseudospin ($\eta$-charge) operators. The magnetic field and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term vanish in the limit of anti-symmetric flux (modulo $\pi$) configuration. In the latter case the three-spin coupling term is given by the scalar pseudospin chirality operator $\sim \mathbf{\eta}_i \cdot \left[\mathbf{\eta}_j \times \mathbf{\eta}_k\right]$.

# Underscreened Kondo Compensation in a Superconductor

Abstract: A magnetic impurity with a larger $S=1$ spin remains partially screened by the Kondo effect when embedded in a metal. However, when placed within an $s$-wave superconductor, the interplay between the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$ and the Kondo temperature $T_K$ induces a quantum phase transition from an underscreened doublet Kondo to an unscreened triplet phase, typically occurring when $\Delta/T_K\approx 1$. We investigate the Kondo compensation of the impurity spin resulting from this partial screening across the quantum phase transition, which together with the spin-spin correlation function serves as a measure of the Kondo cloud's integrity. Deep within the unscreened triplet phase, $\Delta/T_K\gg 1$, the compensation vanishes, signifying complete decoupling of the impurity spin from the environment, while in the partially screened doublet phase, $\Delta/T_K\ll 1$, it asymptotically approaches $1/2$, indicating that half of the spin is screened. Notably, there is a universal jump in the compensation precisely at the phase transition, which we accurately calculate. The spin-spin correlation function exhibits an oscillatory pattern with an envelope function decaying as $\sim 1/x$ at short distances. At larger distances, the superconducting gap induces an exponentially decaying behavior $\sim \exp(-x/\xi_\Delta)$ governed by the superconducting correlation length $\xi_\Delta$, irrespective of the phase, without any distinctive features across the transition. Furthermore, the spectral functions of some relevant operators are evaluated and discussed. In terms of the methods used, a consistent description is provided through the application of multiplicative, numerical and density matrix renormalization group techniques.

Abstract: We develop a mesoscale transport theory for the charge and spin degrees of freedom of itinerant carriers in a $d$-wave altermagnet. Our effective Lagrangian description is built upon the slave-boson formulation of the microscopic $t-J$ model. We obtain a spin-polarized diffusive contribution to the effective Hamiltonian, with no counterpart in conventional antiferromagnetism and parametrized by the spin splitting, that is responsible for the so-called spin-splitter effect in $d$-wave altermagnets. We also elucidate the spin-transfer response of the itinerant fluid as well as the spin pumping into the altermagnet, which show previously unidentified combinations of the charge current and spatial partial derivatives (namely, {$j_{x}^{e}$,$\partial_{y}$} and {$j_{y}^{e}$,$\partial_{x}$}). The emergent spin-transfer physics in $d$-wave altermagnets opens up new possibilities for the dynamics of spin textures, such as the domain-wall motion driven by transverse charge currents. We also consider the effect of elastic distortions in the aforementioned transport properties.

Abstract: Frequency multiplication involves generating harmonics from an input frequency, a technique particularly useful for integrating spin-wave devices operating at different frequencies. While topological magnetic textures offer distinct advantages in spin-wave applications, frequency multiplication has not yet been observed in these structures. Here, we study the magnetization dynamics of magnetic vortices formed in micron-sized disks and squares via wide-field magnetic imaging. We found the occurrence of coherent spin-wave harmonics arising from the gyration of vortex cores driven by microwave fields. This phenomenon reveals a universal mechanism where the periodical motion of delta function-like objects such as vortex cores gives rise to a frequency comb. Our results pave the way for creating nanoscale, tunable spin-based frequency multipliers and open new possibilities for frequency comb generation in a variety of systems.

Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that the conditions for ferromagnetic order in, e.g., magnetite, can be modified by adsorption of chiral molecules. Especially, the coercivity of magnetite was increased by nearly 100 \%, or 20 times the earth magnetic flux density, at room temperature. The coercivity was, moreover, demonstrated to increase linearly with temperature in a finite range around room temperature. Based on these results, a mechanism is proposed for providing the necessary enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy. It is shown that nuclear vibrations (phonons) coupled to ferromagnetic spin excitations (magnons) absorb the thermal energy in the system, thereby diverting the excess energy that otherwise would excite magnons in the ferromagnet. This energy diversion, not only restores the ferromagnetic order but also enhances its stability by increasing the anisotropy energy for magnon excitations. The coupling between phonons with magnons is enabled by chirality due to the lack of inversion symmetry.

Abstract: Femtosecond laser excitation of nanometer thin heterostructures comprising a heavy metal and a magnetically ordered material is known to result in the emission of terahertz radiation. However, the nature of the emitted radiation from heavy metal~/~antiferromagnet heterostructures has sparked debates and controversies in the literature. Here, we unambiguously separate spin and charge contributions from Pt~/~NiO heterostructures by introducing an unprecedented methodology combining high external magnetic fields with a symmetry analysis of the emitted terahertz polarization. We observe two distinct mechanisms of terahertz emission which we identify as optical difference frequency generation and ultrafast laser-induced quenching of the magnetization. We emphasize the absence of spin transport effects and signatures of coherent magnons. Overall, our work provides a general experimental methodology to separate spin and charge contributions to the laser-induced terahertz emission from heterostructures comprising a magnetically ordered material thus holding great potential for advancing terahertz spintronics and establishing terahertz orbitronics.

Abstract: It is known that ferroelectric single crystals can be turned from a polydomain to a monodomain state by the application of an electric field. Here we report an unexpected opposite effect: the formation of through-the-crystal polydomain pattern in a monodomain BaTiO3 crystal in response to the applied electric field favoring the initial orientation of the polarization. The effect is achieved for special electric field direction which equally selects two domain states, which are present in the polydomain pattern. At the formation of the pattern, the new wedge domains propagate from the sides of the sample in the direction transverse to the electric field. The observations are rationalized in terms of a simple analytical model treating energies of competing domain configurations as functions of the electric field. The results of the analytical treatment are supported by phase field modeling.

Abstract: Altermagnet is a newly discovered antiferromagnet, characterized by unique anisotropic spin-split energy bands. It has attracted tremendous interest, because of its promising potential in information storage and processing. However, measuring the distinctive spin-split energy bands arising from altermagnetism remains a challenge. Here, we propose to employ the Coulomb drag to probe altermagnetism. In the Coulomb drag, an electric current in an active layer of electron gases can induce currents in a close but well-isolated passive layer, due to interlayer Coulomb interactions. We find that the Coulomb drag effects in altermagnets are highly sensitive to the orientation of the spin-split Fermi surfaces. As a result, transverse currents can be dragged in the passive layer, leading to Hall drag effects even in absence of spin-orbit coupling, a feature quite different from all previous systems. More importantly, all the drag effects of altermagnets have unique angle dependence, which can be measured in a multi-terminal setup to serve as signatures for altermagnetism. This proposal will inspire increasing explorations on emergent magnetism.

Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.

**Authors:** Ipsita Mandal

arXiv:2412.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the linear-response coefficients, when in-plane electric field ($\mathbf E$) or/and temperature gradient ($\nabla_{\mathbf r} T$) is/are applied on a two-dimensional semimetal harbouring anisotropic Dirac cones. The anisotropy is caused by (1) differing Fermi velocities along the two mutually perpendicular momentum axes, and (2) tilting parameters. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the forms of the response coefficients, in the absence and presence of a nonquantizing magnetic field $\mathbf B$. The magnetic field affects the response only when it is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the material, with the resulting expressions computed with the help of the so-called Lorentz-force operator, appearing in the linearized Boltzmann equation. The solution has to be found in a recursive manner, which produces terms in powers of $|\mathbf B|$.

Abstract: We study the phase ordering dynamics of the classical antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ (nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings) Heisenberg model on the square lattice in the strong frustration regime ($J_2/J_1 > 1/2$). While thermal fluctuations preclude any long-range magnetic order at finite temperatures, the system exhibits a long-range spin-driven nematic phase at low temperatures. The transition into the nematic phase is further shown to belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class based on the critical exponents near the phase transition. Our large-scale stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations find a two-stage phase ordering when the system is quenched from a high-temperature paramagnetic state into the nematic phase. In the early stage, collinear alignments of spins lead to a locally saturated Ising-nematic order. Once domains of well-defined Ising order are developed, the late-stage relaxation is dominated by curvature-driven domain coarsening, as described by the Allen-Cahn equation. The characteristic size of Ising-nematic domains scales as the square root of time, similar to the kinetic Ising model described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our results confirm that the late-stage ordering kinetics of the spin-driven nematic, which is a vestigial order of the frustrated Heisenberg model, belongs to the dynamical universality class of a non-conserved Ising order. Interestingly, the system shows no violation of the superuniversality hypothesis under weak bond disorder. The dynamic scaling invariance is preserved in the presence of weak bond disorder. We also discuss possible applications of our results to materials for which vestigial Ising-nematic order is realized.

arXiv:2412.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits two prominent correlated phenomena in distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a two-dimensional spin helix phase emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity in the scaling dimensions of various operators, accessible by adjusting the interaction strength between electrons. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin textures with rich physics and great potential for unconventional computing. Typically, skyrmions form in bulk crystals with reduced symmetry or ultrathin film multilayers involving heavy metals. Here, we demonstrate the formation of fractional Bloch skyrmion tubes at room temperature by 3D printing ferromagnetic double-helix nanowires with two regions of opposite chirality. Using X-ray microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the coexistence of vortex and anti-parallel spin states induces the formation of fractional skyrmion tubes at zero magnetic fields, minimising the energy cost of breaking the coupling between geometric and magnetic chirality. We also demonstrate control over zero-field states, including pure vortex, or mixed skyrmion-vortex states, highlighting the magnetic reconfigurability of these 3D nanowires. This work shows how interfacing chiral geometries at the nanoscale can enable advanced forms of topological spintronics.

Abstract: We investigate spin dynamics in $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) heterostructures, uncovering a robust mechanism for in-situ modulation of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) through precise control of temperature, applied magnetic field and crystal orientation. Employing cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the interfacial coupling between the N\'eel vector of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and the magnetization of the Py layer is highly tunable across the Morin transition temperature $(T_M)$. Our experiments reveal distinct resonance behavior for different crystal orientations, highlighting the pivotal role of exchange coupling strength in dictating FMR frequencies. Theoretical modeling corroborates the experimental findings, elucidating the dependence of coupling on the relative alignment of the N\'eel vector and ferromagnetic magnetization. Notably, we achieve significant modulation of FMR frequencies by manipulating the N\'eel vector configuration, facilitated by temperature variations, applied magnetic fields and crystal orientation adjustments. These advancements demonstrate the potential for dynamic control of spin interactions in AFM/FM heterostructures, paving the way for the development of advanced spintronic devices with tunable magnetic properties. Our work provides critical insights into the fundamental interactions governing hybrid spin systems and opens new avenues for the design of versatile, temperature-responsive magnetoelectronic applications.

Abstract: Next-generation heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) relies on fast, localized heating of the magnetic medium during the write process. Au plasmonic near-field transducers are an attractive solution to this challenge, but increased thermal stability of Au films is required to improve long-term reliability. This work compares the effect of nanoscale Al, AlOx, and Ta capping films on Au thin films with Ti or Ta adhesion layers for use in HAMR and other high-temperature plasmonic applications. Thermal stability is investigated using a bespoke laser dewetting system, and SEM and AFM are extensively used to interrogate the resulting dewet areas. The most effective capping layers are found to be 0.5-1 nm of Al or AlOx, which can eliminate dewetting under certain conditions. Even one monolayer of AlOx is shown to be highly effective in reducing dewetting. In the case of thicker capping layers of Ta and AlOx, the Au film can easily dewet underneath, leaving an intact capping layer. It is concluded that thinner capping layers are most effective against dewetting as the Au cannot dewet without breaking them and pulling them apart during the dewetting process. A simple model based on energetics considerations is developed, which explains how thinner capping layers can more effectively protect the metal from pore or fissure creation. The model provides some convenient guidelines for choosing both the substrate and capping layer, for a given metal, to maximize the resistance to laser-induced damage.

Abstract: Optical simulators for the Ising model have demonstrated great promise for solving challenging problems in physics and beyond. Here, we develop a spatial optical simulator for a variety of classical statistical systems, including the clock, $XY$, Potts, and Heisenberg models, utilizing a digital micromirror device composed of a large number of tiny mirrors. Spins, with desired amplitudes or phases of the statistical models, are precisely encoded by a patch of mirrors with a superpixel approach. Then, by modulating the light field in a sequence of designed patterns, the spin-spin interaction is realized in such a way that the Hamiltonian symmetries are preserved. We successfully simulate statistical systems on a fully connected network, with ferromagnetic or Mattis-type random interactions, and observe the corresponding phase transitions between the paramagnetic, and the ferromagnetic or spin-glass phases. Our results largely extend the research scope of spatial optical simulators and their versatile applications.

Abstract: Stabilizer entropies and quantum magic have been extensively explored in real-space formulations of quantum systems within the framework of resource theory. However, interesting and transparent physics often emerges in momentum space, such as Cooper pairing. Motivated by this, we investigate the momentum-space structure of Pauli strings and stabilizer entropies in the one-dimensional transverse-field quantum Ising model. By mapping the Ising chain onto momentum-space qubits, where the stabilizer state corresponds to the paramagnetic state, we analyze the evolution of the Pauli string distribution. In the ferromagnetic phase, the distribution is broad, whereas in the paramagnetic phase, it develops a two-peaked structure. We demonstrate that all ferromagnetic states possess the same degree of magic in the thermodynamic limit, while stabilizer entropies are non-analytic at the critical point and vanish with increasing transverse field. The momentum-space approach to quantum magic not only complements its real-space counterpart but also provides advantages in terms of analyzing nonstabilizerness and classical simulability.

Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate precise control over coherently excited circular phonon modes using high-intensity terahertz lasers, opening new pathways towards dynamical, ultrafast design of magnetism in functional materials. While the phonon Zeeman effect enables a theoretical description of phonon-induced magnetism, it lacks efficient angular momentum transfer from the phonon to the electron sector. In this work, we put forward a coupling mechanism based on electron-nuclear quantum geometry, with the inverse Faraday effect as a limiting case. This effect is rooted in the phase accumulation of the electronic wavefunction under a circular evolution of nuclear coordinates. An excitation pulse then induces a transient level splitting between electronic orbitals that carry angular momentum. First-principle simulations on SrTiO$_3$ demonstrate that in parts of the Brillouin zone, this splitting between orbitals carrying angular momentum can easily reach 50 meV.

Abstract: We present an optimal field-free protocol for current-induced switching of a perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic insulator nanoelement on the surface of a topological insulator. The time dependence of in-plane components of the surface current, which drives the magnetization reversal via the Dirac spin-orbit torque with minimal Joule heating, is derived analytically as a function of the switching time and material properties. Our analysis identifies that energy-efficient switching is achieved for vanishing damping-like torque. The optimal reversal time that balances switching speed and energy efficiency is determined. When we compare topological insulators to heavy-metal systems, we find similar switching costs for the optimal ratio between the spin-orbit torque coefficients. However, topological insulators offer the advantage of tunable material properties. Finally, we propose a robust and efficient simplified switching protocol using a down-chirped rotating current pulse, tailored to realistic ferromagnetic/topological insulator systems.

Abstract: In this study, a novel material from the rare-earth based breathing pyrochlore family, Ba3Tm2Zn5O11, was successfully synthesized. Powder x-ray diffraction and high-resolution powder neutron diffraction confirmed phase purity and the F-43m breathing pyrochlore crystal structure, while thermogravimetric analysis revealed incongruent melting behavior compared to its counterpart, Ba3Yb2Zn5O11. High-quality single crystals of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11 were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone technique and assessed using Laue x-ray diffraction and single crystal x-ray diffraction. Thermodynamic characterization indicated paramagnetic behavior down to 0.05 K, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements identified distinct dispersionless crystal electric field energy bands, with the fitted crystal electric field model predicting a single-ion singlet ground state and an energy gap of ~9 meV separating it from the first excited (singlet) state. Additional low-energy excitation studies on single crystals revealed dispersionless bands at 0.8 and 1 meV. Computed phonon dispersions from first-principles calculations ruled out phonons as the origin of these modes, further illustrating the puzzling and unique properties of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11.

Abstract: The intertwining between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and frustration-induced quantum fluctuations offers an ideal ground to realize exotic quantum phenomena in the rare-earth-based kagome lattice. The magnetic susceptibility reveals the presence of two energy scales in agreement with the INS results. The higher energy state is dominated by CEF excitations, where the lowest Kramers ground-state doublet is well separated from the excited state suggesting that the compound realizes a low-energy state at low temperatures. The second energy scale is witnessed via thermodynamic results that reveal an anomaly at 0.3 K typical of a phase transition, which is attributed to the presence of complex magnetic ordering phenomena. The broad maximum in the specific heat well above 0.3 K indicates the presence of short-range spin correlations that is corroborated by muon spin relaxation rate results. The isothermal magnetization reveals a field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau at low temperatures. muSR relaxation rate experiments, on the other hand, neither show the signature of a phase transition nor spin-freezing down to 34 mK. The ZF muSR relaxation is governed by the Orbach process and reveals the presence of a fluctuating state owing to the depopulation of crystal field levels reflected as a constant value of relaxation rate in the temperature range 0.4-10 K. NMR results indicate the presence of fluctuating Nd3+ moments down to 1.8 K consistent with muSR experiments. Our comprehensive results reveal that a field-induced quantum critical phenomenon is at play in this frustrated kagome magnet and enable us to construct a phase diagram exemplifying the proximity effect of competing magnetic states. This sets the stage to investigate the broad RE3BWO9 family of rare-earth kagome magnets promising to host exotic quantum states driven by spin-orbit coupling and geometrical frustration.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in exploring higher-order topology and their semi-metallic counterparts, particularly in the context of Dirac and Weyl semimetals, termed as higher-order Dirac semimetal (HODSM) and higher-order Weyl semimetal (HOWSM). The HODSM phase exhibits hinge Fermi arcs (FAs) with a quantized higher-order topological invariant. Conversely, the HOWSM phase is a hybrid-order topological phase manifesting both surface and hinge FAs as a signature of first- and second-order topology and also possesses both first- and second-order topological invariants. In this work, we investigate a tight binding model for multi-HODSM (mHODSM) hosting multiple hinge FAs having a quantized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) greater than one. Furthermore, we obtain a multi-HOWSM (mHOWSM) phase from the mHODSM by applying an external magnetic field. The mHOWSM phase possesses both the dipolar winding number being the representative invariant for first-order topology, and the QWN, featuring both surface and multiple hinge FAs. We study the spectral properties of the mHODSM and mHOWSM in different geometries. We also investigate the hinge FA-mediated transport in mHOWSM employing a two-terminal setup.

Abstract: The magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructures with a large number of atomic layers leads to a suppression of the superconducting order parameter and appearance of Zeeman-like spin splitting of the local density of states (LDOS). Here we study the magnetic proximity effects in van der Waals S/F heterostructures with a few atomic layers and demonstrate that the corresponding physics is very different from the classical results. We find that the dependence of the superconducting order parameter exhibits dips as a function of the ferromagnetic exchange field and gating. The number of dips is determined by the number of monolayers in the heterostructure and, in general, the superconductivity is not suppressed by large values of the exchange field. The spin splitting of the LDOS cannot be described by an effective Zeeman field and manifests a multiple peak structure, where each peak is connected to a unique spin splitting of one of the superconducting bands, which also can be tuned by gating.

Abstract: Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we construct a time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes, and observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges. Using a frequency-comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong-coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes, analogous to the well-known Young's double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.

Abstract: Imaging spin-wave propagation in magnetic materials in a wide frequency range is crucial for understanding and applying spin-wave dynamics. Recently, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have attracted attention as sensors capable of quantitatively measuring the amplitude and phase of coherent spin waves. However, the conventional sensing protocol has been limited to detecting spin waves whose frequencies match the resonance frequency of the NV spins. We demonstrate that by utilizing the AC Zeeman effect, it is possible to image spin waves propagating in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film over a wide frequency range up to a maximum detuning of 567 MHz without changing the external magnetic field. Our results expand the applicability of NV centers for spin-wave sensing and pave the way for quantitative investigations of the dynamics in various magnetic materials, such as metallic ferromagnets and van der Waals magnets.

Abstract: Accurate quantitative prediction of the finite-temperature properties of a phase transitioning system has been a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics and materials science. Here we regard a collective vector mode as essential quasiparticle excitation of the displacive ferroelectricity. Starting from the quantum statistic description of this excitation, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition theory of displacive ferroelectricity. This theory enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions, in a striking contrast to the widely used Landau-Ginzburg phenomenological description near the critical point. Its applications to the quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$ as well as the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured critical behaviors of the phase transitions and the corresponding dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases without fitting parameters. The theory should be general and can be utilized to understand a broad range of phase transitions in other bosonic systems.

Abstract: When exploring new magnetic materials, the effect of alloying plays a crucial role for numerous properties. By altering the alloy composition, it is possible to tailor, e.g., the Curie temperature ($T_\text{C}$). In this work, $T_\text{C}$ of various alloys is investigated using a previously developed technique [Br\"{a}nnvall et al. Phys. Rev. Mat. (2024)] designed for robust predictions of $T_\text{C}$ across diverse chemistries and structures. The technique is based on density functional theory calculations and utilizes the energy difference between the magnetic ground state and the magnetically disordered paramagnetic state. It also accounts for the magnetic entropy in the paramagnetic state and the number of nearest magnetic neighbors. The experimentally known systems, Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$V$_x$, NiMnSb-based Heusler alloys, Ti$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$N, and Co$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ are investigated. The experimentally unexplored system Fe$_{1-x}$Tc$_x$ is also tested to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed method in guiding future experimental efforts. This work demonstrates the broad applicability of the developed method across various systems, requiring less hands-on adjustments compared to other theoretical approaches.

# Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise

Abstract: Scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements, which underpins the phenomenon known as the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). However, typical decoherence noises disrupts the volume law phase, complicating the observation of MIPT on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise, thereby enabling its detection in experiment. The transition is characterized by the conditional entanglement entropy (CEE), which is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as competing external random fields. When the net external field is zero, a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition is expected, resulting in the MIPT. This zero-field condition also ensures an average apparatus-environment symmetry, making CEE a valid probe of entanglement and establishing the transition as a genuine entanglement phase transition. Additionally, we provide numerical results demonstrate the MIPT in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum circuit under dephasing noise. We also propose a method to estimate the noise rate, enabling the zero-field condition to be achieved experimentally and ensuring the feasibility of our protocol. Our result serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise.

Abstract: The quantum electromagnetic (EM) field is formulated in the Weyl-Wigner representation (WW), which is equivalent to the standard Hilbert space one (HS). In principle it is possible to interpret within WW all experiments involving the EM field interacting with macroscopic bodies, the latter treated classically. In the WW formalism the essential difference between classical electrodynamics and the quantum theory of the EM field is\ just the assumption that there is a random EM field filling space\QTR{it}{, }i.e. the existence of a zero-point field with a Gaussian distribution for the field amplitudes. I analyze a typical optical test of a Bell inequality. The model admits an interpretation compatible with local realism, modulo a number of assumptions assumed plausible.

# Explosive pulsed power to drive a vacuum tube

**Authors:** Alexandra Gurinovich

arXiv:2412.13298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of high-power pulsed radiation sources in any frequency range requires both generation of high power to drive the source and increasing the efficiency of supplied power to radiated electromagnetic field conversion. The former implies generation of high power (that is equal to high-voltage and high-current) pulses. The latter means use of an electron beam moving in vacuum to produce intense radiation: high electron beam current or high current density combined with large cross-section of interaction area are required. Explosive pulsed power could contribute to both of the above being capable to store and deliver much higher specific energy as compared to either dielectrics or magnetics and providing high flexibility for matching with a load by the use of a pulse forming network. Piecemeal matching of explosively driven power supply with the HPM producing load (vacuum tube) is described.

Abstract: Magnetic Detection Electrical Impedance Tomography is a novel technique that could enable non-invasive imaging of fast neural activity in the brain. However, commercial magnetometers are not suited to its technical requirements. Computational modelling was used to determine the optimal number, size and orientation of magnetometers, to inform the future development of MDEIT-specific magnetometers. Images were reconstructed using three sensing axes, arrays of 16 to 160 magnetometers, and cell sizes ranging from 1 to 18 mm. Image quality was evaluated visually and with the weighted spatial variance. Single-axis measurements normal to the surface provided the best image quality, and image quality increased with an increase in sensor number and size. This study can inform future OPM design, showing the size of the vapour cell need not be constrained to that of commercially available OPMs, and that a small array of single-axis, highly sensitive sensors is optimal for MDEIT.

Abstract: The non-reciprocal (unidirectional) atom-photon couplings are crucial for modern photonics ranging from chiral quantum networks to cold-atom many-body physics. In the presented experiment, we demonstrated unidirectional Raman emission of Stokes photons from 87Rb atoms in a ring cavity. A bias magnetic field B0 is applied along z-direction on the atoms to define the quantum axis, which breaks the time inverse symmetry. By transversely applying write laser pulses to drive a \pi-transition of the atoms, we generate spontaneous Raman emissions of Stokes photons from a chiral (\sigma+) transition. The emissions are coupled into the clock-wise (z-direction) and counter-clock-wise (-z-direction) modes of a running-wave cavity, respectively. According to the mirror (parity) symmetry of the atom-light coupling, we demonstrated that spins (polarizations) of the Stokes fields are correlated with their propagation directions along z and -z -axis. The Stokes emissions constrained to the spin-momentum correlation are found to be violation of Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation. Based on the correlation, we demonstrated that the Stokes emissions propagate along the clock-wise or counter-clock-wise via polarization dissipation. The directional factor is up to 1500:1.

Abstract: Optical simulators for the Ising model have demonstrated great promise for solving challenging problems in physics and beyond. Here, we develop a spatial optical simulator for a variety of classical statistical systems, including the clock, $XY$, Potts, and Heisenberg models, utilizing a digital micromirror device composed of a large number of tiny mirrors. Spins, with desired amplitudes or phases of the statistical models, are precisely encoded by a patch of mirrors with a superpixel approach. Then, by modulating the light field in a sequence of designed patterns, the spin-spin interaction is realized in such a way that the Hamiltonian symmetries are preserved. We successfully simulate statistical systems on a fully connected network, with ferromagnetic or Mattis-type random interactions, and observe the corresponding phase transitions between the paramagnetic, and the ferromagnetic or spin-glass phases. Our results largely extend the research scope of spatial optical simulators and their versatile applications.

Abstract: Renaissance Fusion proposes thick liquid metal walls as plasma-facing components for future commercial fusion reactors. It designs and operates proof-of-concept experiments aiming at actively suspending and stabilizing a flowing free-surface liquid metal layer against gravity using Lorentz forces. The first operating prototype consists of a 1 m-diameter chamber in the presence of a magnetic field of the order of 0.3 T. A GaInSn flow is injected inside the chamber, and it is actively suspended thanks to the injection of currents up to 3 kA. To simulate the prototype, a numerical tool capable of modeling magnetohydrodynamics phenomena in two-phase flows has been developed to reproduce and interpret the experimental results. The tool relies on the low-magnetic Reynolds assumption, implements the Volume-of-Fluid method for tracking the free-surface, and couples the electric potential in both fluid and solid domains.

Abstract: Surface acoustic wave (SAW) induced ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) is the critical principle of novel magnetoacoustic coupling devices, such as SAW non-reciprocal propagation and SAW-driven spin pumping. However, the enhancement of magnetoacoustic coupling is constrained by the attenuation of strain in magnetic thin films and the intricate manufacturing process of high-frequency SAW devices. This paper presents the observation of a pronounced enhancement in SAW-induced FMR within a ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet (FM/NM/FM) multilayer structure deposited on a LiNbO3 piezoelectric substrate. This enhancement is driven by spin current transmission, facilitated by the non-parallel alignment of magnetizations between the two FM layers. The increased FMR response is evidenced by an elevated absorption of SAW energy by the magnetic layer, signifying improved magnetoacoustic coupling. This finding opens new avenues for advancing magnetoacoustic coupling devices, providing a pathway to enhanced control and functionality in applications that leverage magnetoacoustic interactions.

Abstract: This study pioneers the two-field correlation spectroscopy (COSY) in zero to ultralow field (ZULF) liquid state NMR, employing hyperpolarized [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate as a model system. We demonstrate the successful integration of signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) for hyperpolarization, enabling the detection of ZULF COSY spectra with increased sensitivity. The use of field cycling allows the acquisition of two-field COSY spectra at varying magnetic field strengths, including zero-field conditions. This enables insight into both J-coupling and Zeeman-dominated regimes benefiting from ULF field observation sensitivity and mitigation of low-frequency noise by conducting readout at higher fields (>5 $\mu$T). Our study explores the effects of polarization transfer, apodization techniques, and the potential for further application of ZULF NMR in chemical analysis exemplified for three X-nuclei and three corresponding molecules: [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate, [$^{15}$N]acetonitrile and [3-$^{19}$F]pyridine. These findings pave the way for more sensitive and cost-effective NMR spectroscopy in low-field regimes.

Abstract: In this work, we utilize new coil objectives for stellarator optimization with autodifferentiation, including pointwise and net coil-coil forces and torques. We use these methods to perform the first large-scale optimization of planar dipole coil arrays, since arrays of small and geometrically simple coils have been proposed to partially produce the 3D magnetic fields for stellarators, generate advantageous magnetic field perturbations in tokamaks, and provide active, real-time control capabilities. We perform an ablation study to show that minimizing the orientation and location of each coil may be essential to get coil forces, coil torques, and field errors to tolerable levels. We conclude by generating planar coil array solutions for three reactor-scale quasi-symmetric stellarators.

Abstract: We present a design and performance tests of an intense source of cold hydrogen atoms for loading large magnetic traps. Our source is based on a cryogenic dissociator of molecular hydrogen at 0.6 K followed by a series of thermal accommodators at 0.5, 0.2 and 0.13 K with inner surfaces covered by a superfluid helium film. All components are thermally anchored to corresponding stages of a dilution refrigerator. The source provides a continuous flux of 7*10^13 H atoms/s in a temperature range of 130-200 mK. We have successfully used the source for loading a large Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap recently built in our laboratory [Ahokas et.al., arXiv:2108.09123 or Rev. Sci. Instr. 93 (2), 023201 (2022)]. Calorimetric measurements of the atomic recombination heat allow reliable determination of the atomic flux and H gas density in the trap. We have tested the performance of the source and loading of H atoms into the trap at various configurations of the trapping field, reducing the magnetic barrier height to 75% and 50% of the nominal value of 0.8 T (0.54 K) as well as at the open configuration of the trap at its lower end, when the atoms are in contact with the trapping cell walls covered by a superfluid helium film. In the latter case, raising the trapping cell temperature to 200-250 mK, the low-field seeking atoms at densities exceeding 10^11 cm^-3 can be stored for the time over 1000 s, sufficiently long for experiments on precision spectroscopy of cold H gas.

Abstract: The measurement of energy is a fundamental tool used, for example, in exploring the early universe, characterizing particle decay processes, as well as in quantum technology and computing. Some of the most sensitive energy detectors are thermal, i.e., bolometers and calorimeters, which operate by absorbing incoming energy, converting it into heat, and reading out the resulting temperature change electrically using a thermometer. Extremely sensitive calorimeters, including transition edge sensors, magnetic microcalorimeters and devices based on 2D conductors such as graphene, have been shown to reach impressive energy resolutions of 17.6 zJ. Very recently superconductor--normal-conductor--superconductor (SNS) radiation sensors with metallic and graphene absorbers have resulted in predictions of full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) energy resolutions of 0.75 zJ and 0.05 zJ = 71 GHz$\times h$, respectively, where $h$ is the Planck constant. However, since these estimates are only mathematically extracted from steady-state noise and responsivity measurements, no calorimetry reaching single-zeptojoule energy resolution or beyond has been demonstrated. Here, we use a metallic SNS sensor to measure the energy of 1-$\mu$s-long 8.4-GHz microwave pulses with a FWHM energy resolution finer than (0.95 $\pm$ 0.02) zJ = (5.9 $\pm$ 0.12) meV, corresponding to 170 photons at 8.4 GHz. The techniques of this work, combined with graphene-based sensors, provide a promising path to real-time calorimetric detection of single photons in the 10 GHz range. Such a device has potential in operating as an accurate measurement device of quantum states such as those of superconducting qubits, or used in fundamental physics explorations including quantum thermodynamics, and the search for axions.

**Authors:** Haidar Al-Naseri, Gert Brodin

arXiv:2412.14099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many purposes, classical plasma dynamics models can work surprisingly well even for strong electromagnetic fields, approaching the Schwinger critical fields, and high frequencies, approaching the Compton frequency. However, the applicability of classical models tends to depend rather sensitively on the details of the problem. In the present paper, we study the specific case of plasma oscillations to draw a line between the classical and quantum relativistic regimes. Due to the field geometry of study, mechanisms like radiation reaction and Breit-Wheeler pair production, which tend to be important for electromagnetic fields, are rather effectively suppressed. Moreover, we find that the polarization current due to the electron spin is generally negligible for frequencies below the Compton frequency, compared to the free current, whose magnitude is well-approximated by the classical Vlasov theory. However, we show that pair creation due to the Schwinger mechanism can sometimes be important for surprisingly modest field strengths, of the order of 10 % of the critical field or even smaller. A rough guideline for when the classical Vlasov theory can be applied is given

It is shown that the use of a cylindrical wave instead of a plane wave does not lead to new angular distributions of the reaction products.

Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that the conditions for ferromagnetic order in, e.g., magnetite, can be modified by adsorption of chiral molecules. Especially, the coercivity of magnetite was increased by nearly 100 \%, or 20 times the earth magnetic flux density, at room temperature. The coercivity was, moreover, demonstrated to increase linearly with temperature in a finite range around room temperature. Based on these results, a mechanism is proposed for providing the necessary enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy. It is shown that nuclear vibrations (phonons) coupled to ferromagnetic spin excitations (magnons) absorb the thermal energy in the system, thereby diverting the excess energy that otherwise would excite magnons in the ferromagnet. This energy diversion, not only restores the ferromagnetic order but also enhances its stability by increasing the anisotropy energy for magnon excitations. The coupling between phonons with magnons is enabled by chirality due to the lack of inversion symmetry.

Abstract: The gradient and curvature of the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field give rise to curvature and gradient guiding centre drifts on cosmic rays. The plasma turbulence present in the interplanetary space is thought to suppress the drifts, however the extent to which they are reduced is not clear. We investigate the reduction of the drifts using a new analytic model of heliospheric turbulence where the dominant 2D component has both the wave vector and the magnetic field vector normal to the Parker spiral, thus fulfilling the main criterion of 2D turbulence. We use full-orbit test particle simulations of energetic protons in the modelled interplanetary turbulence, and analyse the mean drift velocity of the particles in heliolatitude. We release energetic proton populations of 10, 100 and 1000~MeV close to Sun and introduce a new method to assess their drift. We compare the drift in the turbulent heliosphere to drift in a configuration without turbulence, and to theoretical estimates of drift reduction. We find that drifts are reduced by a factor 0.2-0.9 of that expected for the heliospheric configuration without turbulence. This corresponds to a much less efficient suppression than what is predicted by theoretical estimates, particularly at low proton energies. We conclude that guiding centre drifts are a significant factor for the evolution of cosmic ray intensities in the heliosphere including the propagation of solar energetic particles in the inner heliosphere.

Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.

Abstract: Next-generation heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) relies on fast, localized heating of the magnetic medium during the write process. Au plasmonic near-field transducers are an attractive solution to this challenge, but increased thermal stability of Au films is required to improve long-term reliability. This work compares the effect of nanoscale Al, AlOx, and Ta capping films on Au thin films with Ti or Ta adhesion layers for use in HAMR and other high-temperature plasmonic applications. Thermal stability is investigated using a bespoke laser dewetting system, and SEM and AFM are extensively used to interrogate the resulting dewet areas. The most effective capping layers are found to be 0.5-1 nm of Al or AlOx, which can eliminate dewetting under certain conditions. Even one monolayer of AlOx is shown to be highly effective in reducing dewetting. In the case of thicker capping layers of Ta and AlOx, the Au film can easily dewet underneath, leaving an intact capping layer. It is concluded that thinner capping layers are most effective against dewetting as the Au cannot dewet without breaking them and pulling them apart during the dewetting process. A simple model based on energetics considerations is developed, which explains how thinner capping layers can more effectively protect the metal from pore or fissure creation. The model provides some convenient guidelines for choosing both the substrate and capping layer, for a given metal, to maximize the resistance to laser-induced damage.

Abstract: This study aims to validate if MRI can measure anisotropic mesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts from white matter axonal microstructure relative to the B0 direction and if dMRI can estimate this anisotropy. Recent models describe how mesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts depend on induced magnetic fields by axons, described by an orientation distribution function. Using Monte-Carlo simulations of MRI signals in mesoscopic white matter axon substrates, we show MRI can estimate this mesoscopic frequency shift and dMRI can estimate its orientation dependence.

Abstract: The analysis of experimental results with Python often requires writing many code scripts which all need access to the same set of functions. In a common field of research, this set will be nearly the same for many users. The qspec Python package was developed to provide functions for physical formulas, simulations and data analysis routines widely used in laser spectroscopy and related fields. Most functions are compatible with numpy arrays, enabling fast calculations with large samples of data. A multidimensional linear regression algorithm enables a King plot analyses over multiple atomic transitions. A modular framework for constructing lineshape models can be used to fit large sets of spectroscopy data. A simulation module within the package provides user-friendly methods to simulate the coherent time-evolution of atoms in electro-magnetic fields without the need to explicitly derive a Hamiltonian.

Abstract: The coupling of matter to the quantized electromagnetic field of a plasmonic or optical cavity can be harnessed to modify and control chemical and physical properties of molecules. In optical cavities, a term known as the dipole self-energy (DSE) appears in the Hamiltonian to assure gauge invariance. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we introduce a method, which has its own merits and complements existing methods, to compute the DSE. Second, we study the impact of the DSE on cavity-induced nonadiabatic dynamics in a realistic system. For that purpose, various matrix elements of the DSE are computed as functions of the nuclear coordinates and the dynamics of the system after laser excitation is investigated. The cavity is known to induce conical intersections between polaritons, which gives rise to substantial nonadiabatic effects. The DSE is shown to slightly affect these light-induced conical intersections and, in particular, break their symmetry.

Abstract: The ability to image electromagnetic fields holds key scientific and industrial applications, including electromagnetic compatibility, diagnostics of high-frequency devices, and experimental scientific work involving field interactions. Generally electric and magnetic field measurements require conductive elements which significantly distort the field. However, electromagnetic fields can be measured without altering the field via the shift they induce on Rydberg states of alkali atoms in atomic vapor, which are highly sensitive to electric fields. Previous field measurements using Rydberg atoms utilized electromagnetically induced transparency to read out the shift on the states induced by the fields, but did not provide spatial resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that electromagnetically induced transparency can be spatially resolved by imaging the fluorescence of the atoms. We demonstrate that this can be used to image $\sim$ V/cm scale electric fields in the DC-GHz range and $\sim$ mT scale static magnetic fields, with minimal distortion to the fields. We also demonstrate the ability to image $\sim$ 5 mV/cm scale fields for resonant microwave radiation and measure standing waves generated by the partial reflection of the vapor cell walls in this regime. With additional processing techniques like lock-in detection, we predict that our sensitivities could reach down to nV/cm levels. We perform this field imaging with a spatial resolution of 160 $\mu$m, limited by our imaging system, and estimate the fundamental resolution limitation to be 5 $\mu$m.

Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} < \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} > 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} > \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.

# Ambient temperature isolation of a monoatomic boron(0) complex

## 单原子硼 (0) 配合物的室温分离

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-m0rg4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Felipe, Fantuzzi

The first bottleable example of a neutral Group 13 atom bound only by neutral donor ligands (L) has been fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and its structure determined by a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. A two-coordinate paramagnetic L2B0 complex can readily be accessed through a facile reduction reaction and is stabilized by π-accepting cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands. Further reduction of (CAAC)2B leads to the isolation of a stable diamagnetic boride anion. In turn, oxidation leads to the putative formation of a transient two-coordinate cationic borylene which has been trapped to form a stable boron(I) complex. Density functional theory calculations support the formulation of (CAAC)2B as a boron(0) complex stabilized by strong multiple bonding.

## 推进磁活性环氧形状记忆复合材料的3D打印: 将流变性，可印刷性和形状保真度相关联

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5449807/latest

shape memory polymers (SMPs) stand out as versatile candidates possessing actuation, shape memory effect, and sensing capabilities. This study investigates the impact of iron oxide (Fe3O4) functionalization by Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) on the magnetic and rheological properties of SMP composites. Optical microscopy shows improved Fe3O4 particle dispersion and distribution due to PEG coating. Magnetic characterization using Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM) reveals enhanced mass magnetization of the functionalized Fe3O4-loaded SMP composites. By replacing unfunctionalized Fe3O4 with Fe3O4_PEG20, the saturation magnetization of SMP composites improved by 19%. Rheological tests reveal that fumed silica has a major effect on the shear thinning behavior of SMP dispersions. Also, PEG functionalized dispersions exhibit enhanced shear thinning behavior and shape fidelity compared to unfunctionalized dispersions. Shape fidelity test revealed the reduction of die-swell of SMP dispersions loaded with Fe3O4_PEG30 and improved percent deformation from 439&amp;ndash;5% for SMP(93.39)_Silica(4.11)_Fe3O4(2.5) and SMP(83.81)_Silica(3.69)_Fe3O4(12.5)_PEG30, respectively. The improved rheological behavior and shape fidelity make PEG-functionalized SMP composites promising candidates for 3D printing and other processing methods. These findings contribute to the development of advanced stimuli-responsive materials with tunable properties for various applications, including soft robotics, and biomedical devices.

# Replaced right posterior cerebral artery associated with ipsilateral superior cerebellar artery type persistent trigeminal artery variant diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography

## 磁共振血管造影诊断为与同侧小脑上动脉相关的右脑后动脉置换型永存三叉动脉变异

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5512462/latest

Purpose To describe a case in which a right replaced posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was associated with an ipsilateral superior cerebellar artery (SCA) type persistent trigeminal artery (PTA) variant.Methods A 53-year-old man who had been diagnosed with chronic dissection of the left vertebral artery (VA) 4 months previously underwent follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) angiography using a 3-Tesla scanner.Results MR angiography showed a slightly dilated left VA at the terminal segment without interval change. An artery arising from the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and continuing to the right SCA without connection to the basilar artery is indicative of the SCA type PTA variant. There was also a large artery arising from the supraclinoid segment of the right ICA and continuing to the right PCA. In addition, a tiny artery arose from the right ICA proximal to the origin of the large artery. There were no tiny arteries arising from the right ICA distal to the origin of the large artery. Therefore, the tiny artery is considered to be a hypoplastic posterior communicating artery and the large artery is considered to be a replaced PCA.Conclusion A replaced PCA is an extremely rare variation, from which all branches of the PCA arise from the anterior choroidal artery. The SCA type PTA variant is also rare. This is the first report of a case of a combination of these two variations; however, they had no developmental relationship. Thus, our patient incidentally had two extremely rare ipsilateral variations.

# Gender-Based Analysis of the Ratio of Femoral Condyle Depth and Intercondylar Notch Depth to the Intercondylar Surface for Femoral Intercondylar Notch anatomy Using MRI Images: Implications for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Risk

## 使用MRI图像对股骨髁间切迹解剖的股骨髁深度和髁间切迹深度与髁间表面的比率进行基于性别的分析: 对前交叉韧带损伤风险的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5508407/latest

Purpose Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common injury, particularly in athletes. Recent studies have suggested a potential association between femoral intercondylar notch geometry and ACL injury risk. Understanding the anatomical differences in the intercondylar notch between the sexes may help explain the higher incidence of ACL injuries in women. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows evaluation of the femoral intercondylar notch and ACL geometry.Methods We measured four different geometric indices of the distal femur using axial PD fast spin echo MRI imaging. These indices included the maximum intercondylar notch width to femoral condyle width (NWI), the ratio of intercondylar notch shape index (NSI), the total articular surface area of the inferior femoral area (NAI), and the ratio of femoral condyle depth to intercondylar notch depth (NDI).Results In this retrospective study, we evaluated the femoral intercondylar notch geometry in 136 patients (81 males, 55 females) using cross-sectional MRI. The mean values for NWI, NSI, NAI, and NDI were 0.27&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.03 mm and 0.25&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.04 mm, 0.73&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.06 mm and 0.68&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.07 mm, 0.12&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.02 mm and 0.10&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0, 01 mm, and 0.45&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.02 mm and 0.47&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.01 mm for men and women, respectively. Notably, the NDI index was deeper in women than in men.Conclusion Our findings suggest that women have a deeper NDI index, indicating potentially greater pressure on the ACL and increased susceptibility to injury. By gaining a better understanding of the anatomical differences between men and women, we can develop more effective prevention strategies to reduce the risk of ACL injuries, particularly in female athletes.

# Ulnar Nerve Double Crush by Entrapment of a Peri-cubital tunnel ganglion cyst and Cubital tunnel: a Case report

## 肘部周围隧道神经节囊肿和肘部隧道的压迫导致尺神经双重挤压: 一例病例报告

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5464423/latest

Background: Double crush syndrome (DCS) is a relatively rare nerve compression syndrome among peripheral nerve compression diseases. However, ulnar nerve double entrapmentcaused by peri-cubital tunnel ganglion cysts has been rarely reported.
Case presentation: Here, we present a case of a 54-year-old woman who experienced occasionalpain, numbness and paralysis in her right half hand for 1 year. A B-ultrasound of the right elbow initially revealed cubital tunnel syndrome only. Further Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a ganglion cyst near the cubital tunnel. After evaluation, we performed open surgery to excise the cyst and incise the cubital tunnel, completely decompressing the ulnar nerve entrapment. Ulnar nerve anterior transposition was also performed simultaneously.
Conclusions: The patient was followed up for 1 month, and she experienced a complete recovery with no functional limitations.

In this study, a MXene-based electromagnetic absorber with a simpledesign at terahertz frequencies is proposed. An absorber that has aMXene layer drilled into with square and circular cavities and thin alu-minum layer as a reflector was examined. With the proper design ofthe structure dimensions, a MXene-based refractive index sensor with adual-band at THz frequency and 99.93% and 97.85% absorption lev-els were obtained. The proposed design achieved 1983 and 1935 Q-factorvalues at frequencies of 0.446 THz and 0.583 THz, respectively. Theproposed sensor with fractional bandwidth of 0.050% and 0.052% hassensitivity values of 686.2 and 557.6 (GHz/RIU). The figure of meritof the proposed sensor is calculated as 3049.8 and 1852.5 (1/RIU) andthe proposed sensor is compared with sensor available in the litera-ture. Since the designed absorber can detect refractive index changes, italso has potential applications in the identification of biological samples.

# Disc Degeneration in Distal Unfused Segments: Cause or Consequence of Adding-On After Posterior Fusion of Lenke 3c, 5c, 6c Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis?

## 远端未融合节段的椎间盘退变: Lenke 3c，5c，6c青少年特发性脊柱侧凸后路融合后增加的原因或后果？

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5112797/latest

Background The aim of this study is to examine the association between adding-on (AO) and disc degeneration(DD) of distal unfused levels in Lenke 3C, 5C, 6C adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) &amp;nbsp;patients with a follow-up of at least two years by comparing preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&amp;nbsp;
Methods 47 AIS patients (32 females and 15 males) with structural thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL/L) curves treated with long segment thoracolumbar fusion were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups according to the occurrence of the AO (AO and Non-AO groups). The unfused discs were graded using the MRI images according to the Pfirrmann grading method. The Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire and Visuel Analog Scale (VAS) were used to determine clinical outcomes.&amp;nbsp;
Results The frequency of AO was found to be 29.78%. Preoperative MT curve and TL/L curve angles; LIV translation, LIV disc angle, &amp;nbsp;LIV +1 translation at final follow-up and the number of fused levels were significantly higher in the AO group. Postoperative total Pfirrmann Score was significantly associated with AO. L5-S1 disc in the AO group had a statistically significant higher Pfirrmann grade than the Non-AO group. No significant association was found between the VAS and SRS-22 scores related to AO, DD or other radiological outcomes.&amp;nbsp;
Conclusion Although the AO was detected at a high rate in Lenke 3C, 5C, 6C AIS patients and its association with DD in distal unfused levels was demonstrated, no impact on clinical scores was found. Furthermore, patients with AO developed significantly higher DD in L5-S1 disc, even if it is not the segment adjacent to the fusion. Even if this DD does not cause complaints in the young AIS population, L5-S1 disc should be evaluated in patients with AO, since it may cause complaints in longer follow-up. &amp;nbsp;

# Transperineal approach alone as minimally invasive surgery for pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer after abdominoperineal resection

## 单纯经会阴入路微创手术治疗直肠癌腹会阴切除术后盆腔复发

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5653986/latest

Introduction: In this report, we describe a case of pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer invading a seminal vesicle after abdominoperineal resection, which was removed only by a transperineal approach with the addition of urethrography.
Case: The patient, a man in his 60s, underwent laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection for lower rectal cancer at another hospital. Thirty months after the surgery, he was referred to our department for surgery for a recurrent tumor in the pelvis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumor on the dorsal prostate that was suspected to have invaded a seminal vesicle.&amp;nbsp;
Surgical findings: After incision in the previous perineal surgical wound, a subcutaneous incision was made and a GelPOINT mini was attached. Airflow was applied with the AirSeal system, and the surgery was performed laparoscopically. To accurately identify the dissection layers and avoid urethral injury, intraoperative urethrography was performed as necessary, and dissection was performed with an electrocautery and ultrasonic coagulation incision device while confirming the position of the urethra and forceps. The prostate was safely identified by urethrography and separated from the firm tumor. After dissecting the fatty tissue surrounding the tumor, the affected seminal vesicle was partially resected. The dorsal side of the tumor was dissected using the coccygeal bone and the levator ani muscle as guides, and the tumor was removed.
Conclusion: In select cases, the TaTME technique may allow minimally invasive surgery using only a transanal or transperineal approach.

# Knotted Magnetic Field Lines via Magnetic Reconnection during an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection

## 行星际日冕物质抛射过程中通过磁性重新连接打结的磁场线

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5638643/latest

Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in astrophysics and plasma physics that involves a change in the topological structure of magnetic fields. The long ray-like current sheet (CS) trailing behind a solar coronal mass ejection (CME) serves as a unique reconnection site, extending in length from several to over twenty solar radii. However, the three-dimensional (3D) geometry, internal reconnection process and the resultant topological changes in the magnetic field remain elusive. Here, in a 3D isothermal magnetohydrodynamic simulation that covers the entire solar-terrestrial region to follow a CME evolution through the solar wind from Sun to Earth, we reproduce all major observational features of CS and recover observationally inferred plasma blobs inside the CS. Furthermore, we find that magnetic reconnection within the long CS results in a knotting of magnetic field lines and the formation of a M\"obius band. When the CME propagates in the Sun-earth space, these knotted magnetic fields persist and continue moving earth-ward. Our findings open a new window to understanding complex topological magnetic structures.

# Dissipationless transport signature of topological nodal lines

## 拓扑节点线的无耗散传输特征

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4508425/latest

Topological materials, such as topological insulators or semimetals, usually not only reveal the
nontrivial properties of their electronic wavefunctions through the appearance of stable boundary
modes, but also through very specific electromagnetic responses. The anisotropic longitudinal magnetoresistance of Weyl semimetals, for instance, carries the signature of the chiral anomaly of Weyl fermions. However for topological nodal line (TNL) semimetals &ndash; materials where the valence and conduction bands cross each other on one-dimensional curves in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone &ndash; such a characteristic has been lacking. Here we report the discovery of a peculiar charge transport effect generated by TNLs: a dissipationless transverse signal in the presence of coplanar electric and magnetic fields, which originates from a Zeeman induced conversion of TNLs into Weyl nodes under infinitesimally small magnetic fields. We evidence this dissipationless topological response in trigonal PtBi2 persisting up to room temperature, and unveil the extensive TNLs in the band structure of this non-magnetic material. These findings provide a new pathway to engineer Weyl
nodes by arbitrary small magnetic fields and reveal that bulk topological nodal lines can exhibit
non-dissipative transport properties.

# Space-Time Decoupled Metasurface Integrating Reflective Mixer and Phase Shifter Functions

## 集成反射混频器和移相器功能的时空解耦超表面

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5603929/latest

Electromagnetic (EM) information metasurface represents a class of 2D metamaterials that can swiftly manipulate their EM characteristics to convey specific information. Past researches present various strategies for embedding information within ambient EM waves through the superposition of time-varying quantized properties for each unit. Despite their capabilities, these approaches alone are insufficient for concurrently but independently realizing the creation of information and the allocation of spatial energy. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive approach named the space-time decoupled metasurface (STD-Metasurface), facilitating the simultaneous and independent control of information modulation and passive beamforming by incorporating reflective mixer and phase shifter functionalities into each unit. As a proof of concept, we present a minimalist design of single-diode unit where the ingenious utilization of analog switch bonds the digital signal and analog signal together. By inputting baseband analogue signals in a specific level range, STD-Metasurface prototype is capable of modulating them onto the envelopes of reflected EM waves without distortion meanwhile controlling the reflected radiation patterns by digital signals, even waveform superposition and spatial multiplexing. To demonstrate the superior capabilities of the STD-Metasurface, we have developed an experimental platform to highlight its practicality and potential applications as a reconfigurable backscatter transmitter and a dynamic Doppler-spoofing reflector array.
