# Final state interactions for high energy scattering off atomic electrons

**Authors:** Ryan Plestid and Mark B. Wise

Author(s): Ryan Plestid and Mark B. Wise<br /><p>Fixed target experiments involving high-energy leptons scattering off atoms are important for precision measurements, including constraining neutrino fluxes and determining hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. This paper examines the assumption that bound electrons can be treated as free, considering the effects of previously neglected final state Coulomb interactions. Fortunately, these corrections are found to cancel at least up to order α^2, giving us confidence in the precision achievable at such experiments.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRD/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.113007.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

Author(s): M. Cosset-Chéneau, S. H. Tirion, X.-Y. Wei, J. Ben Youssef, and B.

Three distinct topological degrees of freedom are used to define all topological spin textures based on out-of-plane and in-plane spin configurations: the topological charge, representing the number of times the magnetization vector m wraps around the unit sphere; the vorticity, which quantifies the angular integration of the magnetic moment along the circumferential direction of a domain wall; and the helicity, defining the swirling direction of in-plane magnetization.

# 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in analysis of cerebral metabolite: MRS image for elderly patient anesthesia

## 脑代谢物分析中的1h磁共振波谱 (MRS): 老年患者麻醉的MRS图像

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5406479/latest

Background: The phenomenon of population aging is progress rapidly and globally, indicating more research is needed to target elderly cohort. It&rsquo;s well-known that general anesthesia can have a neurocognitive impact on elderly patients, affecting their prognosis. However, the underlying mechanism of how general anesthesia affects brain function has not yet been elucidated. The impact of general anesthesia on brain metabolism may be the key to studying the effects of anesthetic drugs on the brain. At present, research on brain metabolism mainly relies on cerebrospinal fluid and animal models, and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can explore changes in metabolic products in specific regions of the brain, providing a new non-invasive in vivodetection method for studying the effects of general anesthesia on brain metabolism.
Objective: To evaluate the effect of general anesthesia on brain metabolism before and after aging brain anesthesia, using non-invasive brain MRS method. This experiment is a one arm two sessions longitudinal imaging study aimed at investigating the brain metabolic changes in patients before and after anesthesia induced by general anesthetics.
Method: 30 patients with oral and maxillofacial tumors were randomly selected and evaluated with a cognitive function scale before surgery to ensure that they have no neurocognitive dysfunction. Perform preoperative and one day postoperative head MRS scans testing on patients. The detection sequences included MEGA-PRESS optimsed for GABA detection, and short echo-time as well as long echo-time PRESS sequences at left prefrontal area. MRS data were analyzed and compared using LCModel and TARQUIN. Paired t-test was conducted to detecting metabolites&rsquo; change before and after the surgery.
Result: 30 patients were observed to have changes in the prefrontal cortex. We found a significant decrease of GABA concentration using MEGA-PRESS sequence, and a significant increase of Glutamate/Glutamineconcentration detected by both short TE and long TE PRESS sequences.

# Dual-Metal-Doped Perovskite Adsorbents for Efficient Removal of Humic Acid

## 双金属掺杂钙钛矿吸附剂高效去除腐殖酸的研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5225322/latest

Humic acid (HA), a complex organic compound of natural matter, is harmless on its own but can form carcinogenic disinfection byproducts such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids during water chlorination and disinfection processes, posing serious risks to aquatic organisms and human health. We present a B-site dual-metal-doping strategy to fabricate ferromagnetic perovskite-type adsorbents for rapid and efficient HA degradation. Through B-site modification with Ti and Co, the resulting perovskite absorbent exhibits a rapid HA adsorption rate with a high adsorption capacity of 381 mg/g. We demonstrate that the adsorbent can be regenerated in situ or magnetically recovered for Fenton regeneration. The dynamic adsorption behavior of HA is accurately described and predicted by the Bed Depth Service Time (BDST), Thomas, and Yoon-Nelson models while computational simulations provide insights into the interactions between the perovskite adsorbent and HA molecules. Our findings reveal the potential of perovskite materials as highly effective catalytic adsorbents for organic compounds that can be efficiently regenerated, paving the way for their development in water remediation applications.

# Integration of temperature-sensitive hydrogels loaded with realgar and magnetic particles for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment

## 负载雄黄和磁性颗粒的温敏水凝胶的整合用于肺癌的诊断和治疗

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5409373/latest

Introduction: Lung cancer has a high incidence rate and a poor prognosis with traditional treatments like surgery and radiotherapy, necessitating the active exploration of new treatment methods. Realgar (AS4S4), a traditional Chinese medicine, has chemotherapeutic efficacy. However, its low solubility, complex dosage form, and single therapeutic efficacy limit its further application in modern medicine. To monitor tumors and combine magnetic induction thermotherapy, magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) particles were introduced, and a local injection therapy system was developed by combining the two with a temperature-sensitive hydrogel.  Methods: AS4S4 was chemically synthesized using hydrochloric acid to disrupt the bonding between AS and NH2 to obtain andrography nanoclusters, which improved the solubility and reduced the toxic side reactions. Furthermore, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were introduced, and the two performance nanomaterials were combined using a smart temperature-sensitive hydrogel to construct a locally injected nanodiagnostic therapy with fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging dual-modal imaging-guided chemotherapy and magneto-induced thermotherapy combined unit (AS4S4/Fe3O4@Gel).  Results: Characterization results showed that the hydrogel exhibited satisfactory temperature sensitivity, 85% controlled drug release at 42 oC, and good biocompatibility. The results of cellular experiments showed that AS4S4/Fe3O4@Gel induced apoptosis and iron death in lung cancer cells, while the combination with magnetic induction hyperthermia (ACMF) significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation. In a mouse model of transplanted tumors in Holland Lewis cells, AS4S4/Fe3O4@Gel showed good fluorescence properties and magneto-thermal effects. The combined ACMF group exerted better antitumor effects than the negative control group.  Conclusion: The AS4S4/Fe3O4@Gel prepared in this study can exert synergistic antitumor activity in combination with ACMF under bimodal imaging guidance, and it is a potential means of clinical treatment for lung cancer.

# Selective magnetoelectric stimulation antagonizes GABAA receptors subunit in the left prelimbic cortex neurons to alleviate schizophrenia-like behaviors

## 选择性磁电刺激拮抗左前边皮质神经元的GABAA受体亚单位以减轻精神分裂症样行为

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5328250/latest

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a prevalent and disabling mental disorder. Clinically, its complex symptoms, including negative symptoms and cognitive impairments, can be ameliorated using electromagnetic techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). To investigate the neural mechanisms of magnetic stimulation and identify selective therapeutic targets, we employed a combined magnetic stimulation system treatment (c-MSST). Targeting the mouse left prelimbic cortex (PrL) with c-MSST reversed SCZ-like behaviors and dendritic spine density reductions induced by MK-801 injection. SCZ-like mice showed a region-specific increase in Gabre (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit epsilon) in the left PrL, normalized by c-MSST. Specific Gabre knockdown in the left PrL reversed SCZ-like behaviors induced by MK-801. Additionally, the transgenic mouse with Gabre knock-in specific to the PrL exhibited SCZ-like behaviors and synaptic plasticity deficits, both reversed by c-MSST. Overexpression of the p62 gene disrupted Gabarap and Gabarapl1 binding, reducing Gabre surface expression. Our findings suggest Gabre and related circuits as promising targets for schizophrenia treatment.
