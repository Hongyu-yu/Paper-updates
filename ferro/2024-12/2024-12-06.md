# Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility

## 来自一维迁移率的巡回铁磁性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03638

arXiv:2412.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.

# Magnetic impurities in a strongly coupled superconductor

## 强耦合超导体中的磁性杂质

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03646

arXiv:2412.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit certain aspects of a problem concerning the influence of carrier scattering induced by magnetic impurities in metals on their superconducting properties. Superconductivity is assumed to be driven by strong electron-phonon interaction. We use the self-consistent solution of the Nagaoka equations for the scattering matrix together with the Migdal-Eliashberg theory of superconductivity to compute the energy of the in-gap bound states, superconducting critical temperature and tunneling density of states for a wide range of values of the Kondo temperature and impurity concentrations. It is found that similar to the case of the weak coupling (BCS) superconductors there is only one pair of the bound states inside the gap as well as re-entrant superconductivity for the case of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the conduction electrons and magnetic impurities. In agreement with the earlier studies we find that the gapless superconductivity can be realized which in the case of antiferromagnetic exchange requires much smaller impurity concentration. Surprisingly, in contrast with the weakly coupled superconductors we find that superconducting transition exhibits two critical temperatures for the ferromagnetic exchange coupling.

The order parameters of the supersolid are analyzed and an understanding of its lack of ferromagnetic moment is suggested.

# Non-linear Faraday Precession of Light Polarization in Time-Reversal Invariant Materials

## 时间反转不变材料中光偏振的非线性法拉第进动

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03656

arXiv:2412.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through materials displaying a non-linear Hall effect. The coupled Maxwell-Boltzmann equations for traveling waves can be mapped onto ordinary differential equations that resemble those for the motion of a pendulum. In the weakly non-linear regime relevant for most experiments, we find that the polarization of light displays a Faraday-like precession of its polarization direction that swings back and forth around the direction of Berry dipole vector as the light beam traverses the material. This occurs concomitantly with an oscillation of its degree of polarization, with a characteristic frequency that increases linearly with the intensity of the traveling wave. These effects could be observed by measuring thickness dependent Faraday rotations as well as the emission of lower frequency radiation associated with the polarization oscillations in materials displaying the non-linear Hall effect.

# Dirac points and Weyl phase in a honeycomb altermagnet

## 蜂窝altermagnet中的Dirac点和Weyl相

arXiv:2412.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graphene derivative displaying novel topological phenomena without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a collinear altermagnet. By investigating the retarded and advanced Green's functions, we calculate the spectral density and amplitude of wave function whose exact solutions are analytically obtained. The altermagnetism breaks the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry, guaranteeing the formation of pairs of Weyl points associated with the internal spin structure chiralities. We demonstrate the evolution of Dirac and Weyl crossings, in which spontaneous Hall effect is controlled by the chiral edge modes. Topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands. We illustrate possible experiments to realize topologically altermagnetic responses according to the bulk-boundary correspondence.

## 用于环境传感器的铁电畴壁

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03691

arXiv:2412.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls in ferroelectric oxides provide fertile ground for the development of next-generation nanotechnology. Examples include domain-wall-based memory, memristors, and diodes, where the unusual electronic properties and the quasi-2D nature of the walls are leveraged to emulate the behavior of electronic components at ultra-small length scales. Here, we demonstrate atmosphere-related reversible changes in the electronic conduction at neutral ferroelectric domain walls in Er(Mn,Ti)O$_3$. By exposing the system to reducing and oxidizing conditions, we drive the domain walls from insulating to conducting, and vice versa, translating the environmental changes into current signals. Density functional theory calculations show that the effect is predominately caused by charge carrier density modulations, which arise as oxygen interstitials accumulate at the domain walls. The work introduces an innovative concept for domain-wall based environmental sensors, giving an additional dimension to the field of domain wall nanoelectronics and sensor technology in general.

# Density of states and differential entropy in the Dirac materials in crossed magnetic and in-plane electric fields

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03703

arXiv:2412.03703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density of states and differential entropy per particle are analyzed for Dirac-like electrons in graphene subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field and an in-plane electric field. For comparison, the derived density of states is contrasted with the well-known case of nonrelativistic electrons in crossed magnetic and electric fields. The study considers ballistic electrons and also includes the effect of small impurity scattering. In the latter case, the limit of zero magnetic field and the so-called collapse of Landau levels in graphene are examined analytically. By comparing the results with numerical calculations on graphene ribbons, we demonstrate that the Landau state counting procedure must be modified for Dirac-like electrons, leading to a field-dependent Landau level degeneracy factor. Additionally, it is shown that peaks in the differential entropy arise from the dispersionless surface mode localized at the zigzag edges of the ribbon.

Abstract: Van der Waals magnets are an emerging material family for investigating light-matter interactions and spin-correlated excitations. Here, we report the discovery of a photo-induced state with a lifetime of 17 ps in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$, which appears exclusively with resonant pumping at 1.476 eV in the antiferromagnetic state. The long-lived state comes with a negative photoconductivity, a characteristic optical response of population inversion. Our findings demonstrate a promising pathway to potentially achieve long-lived lasing at terahertz frequencies in reduced dimensions.

arXiv:2412.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strange metals challenge our understanding of charge transport in metals. Here, we investigate how the strange metal phase of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is impacted by a field-induced glassy antiferromagnetic state. Using magnetic fields above 80 T, we discover a strong enhancement of the normal state magnetoresistance when entering the spin glass phase. We demonstrate that the spin glass causes insulating-like upturns in the resistivity inside the pseudogap phase, which resolves the origin of the ''metal-insulator'' crossover. In addition the strange metal phase appears at low temperatures over an extended range of magnetic fields where magnetic moments fluctuate, and disappears when these moments freeze out. We conclude that the transport properties of the strange metal phase are controlled by magnetic fluctuations persisting at the lowest temperatures.

Abstract: We present the first circularly polarized Floquet engineering time-resolved Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (tr-RIXS) experiment in H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$, an iridium-based Kitaev system. Our calculations and experimental results are consistent with the modification of the low energy magnetic excitations in H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ only during illumination by the laser pulse, consistent with the Floquet engineering of the exchange interactions. However, the penetration length mismatch between the X-ray probe and laser pump and the intrinsic complexity of Kitaev magnets prevented us from unequivocally extracting towards which ground H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ was driven. We outline possible solutions to these challenges for Floquet stabilization and observation of the Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid limit by RIXS.

# Prediction of polarization vortices, charge modulation, flat bands, and moir\'e magnetism in twisted oxide bilayers

## 扭曲氧化物双层中极化涡旋，电荷调制，平带和莫尔磁性的预测

arXiv:2412.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent surge of interest in moir\'e superlattices of twisted van der Waals compounds has spotlighted the emergence of unconventional superconductivity and novel electronic phases. However, the range of moir\'e phenomena can be dramatically expanded by incorporating complex oxide materials into twisted heterostructures. In this study, motivated by the recent breakthroughs in synthesis of free-standing oxide membranes, we explore the emergent structural and electronic properties of twisted oxide bilayers. We focus on the classic perovskite oxide, SrTiO3, and design SrTiO3 bilayers with a relative twist between the individual layers. Using density functional theory calculations, we predict the appearance of vortex-antivortex polarization patterns at the interface of the SrTiO3 bilayers driven by twist. We also predict charge modulation of the interfacial Ti ions induced by varying local coordination which follow the moir\'e pattern. Furthermore, we forecast the emergence of flat bands at large twist angles and the associated localized electronic states with moir\'e-periodic charge density, originating from the interlayer bonding effects resulting in the formation of dangling bonds. Finally, we predict that hole doping induces unconventional d0 magnetism in otherwise nonmagnetic SrTiO3, driven by the exchange splitting of the high-density O-p bands and producing the spin density with moir\'e periodicity. These results demonstrate a broad landscape of emergent phenomena which may occur in moir\'e-engineered oxide heterostructures showing far-reaching perspectives of these material systems for further fundamental studies and potential applications.

# Confined Magnetization at the Sublattice-Matched Ruthenium Oxide Heterointerface

## 在亚晶格匹配的氧化钌异质界面处的受限磁化

arXiv:2412.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating a heterostructure by combining two magnetically and structurally distinct ruthenium oxides is a crucial approach for investigating their emergent magnetic states and interactions. Previously, research has predominantly concentrated on the intrinsic properties of the ferromagnet SrRuO3 and recently discovered altermagnet RuO2 solely. Here, we engineered an ultrasharp sublattice-matched heterointerface using pseudo-cubic SrRuO3 and rutile RuO2, conducting an in-depth analysis of their spin interactions. Structurally, to accommodate the lattice symmetry mismatch, the inverted RuO2 layer undergoes an in-plane rotation of 18 degrees during epitaxial growth on SrRuO3 layer, resulting in an interesting and rotational interface with perfect crystallinity and negligible chemical intermixing. Performance-wise, the interfacial layer of 6 nm in RuO2 adjacent to SrRuO3 exhibits a nonzero magnetic moment, contributing to an enhanced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) at low temperatures. Furthermore, our observations indicate that, in contrast to SrRuO3 single layers, the AHE of [(RuO2)15/(SrRuO3)n] heterostructures shows nonlinear behavior and reaches its maximum when the SrRuO3 thickness reaches tens of nm. These results suggest that the interfacial magnetic interaction surpasses that of all-perovskite oxides (~5-unit cells). This study underscores the significance and potential applications of magnetic interactions based on the crystallographic asymmetric interfaces in the design of spintronic devices.

# Electric field control of the exchange field of a single spin impurity on a surface

## 表面上单个自旋杂质的交换场的电场控制

arXiv:2412.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric control of spins offers faster switching and more localized manipulation compared to magnetic fields. In this work, we investigate static electric field effects on electron spin resonance of single molecules and atoms using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe significant resonance frequency shifts when varying the applied DC voltage. These shifts cannot be adequately explained by g-factor changes or adsorbate displacement. Instead, we propose a model based on the control of the magnetic exchange field exerted to the spin impurity by the static electric field, which accurately reproduces the static electric field dependence of the resonance frequency. Our work provides crucial insights into electric field influence on surface spins, advancing fundamental understanding for many quantum technologies with efficient spin control via electric fields.

# Evolution of Critical Current Density in CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ with La-doping

arXiv:2412.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystals of (Ca$_{1-x}$La$_x$)KFe$_4$As$_4$ (0 <= x <=0.16) have been grown by using the self-flux method, and the evolution of physical properties including the critical current density (Jc) with La-doping has been investigated. Tc decreases monotonically with increasing x, while Jc at the same temperature and magnetic field increases initially and reach its maximum at x = 0.082. The increase in Jc is more obvious at low temperatures and high fields. At T = 5 K and H = 40 kOe, Jc reaches 0.34 MA/cm$^2$, which is ~4 times larger than that for pure crystals. It is also found that anomalous temperature dependence of Jc in CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ is wiped away as the La content is increased. However, Jc shows non-monotonic field dependence (peak effect) at high fields in crystals with large x. In addition, we found that despite weak anisotropy of H$_{c2}$, there is extremely large anisotropy of Jc up to ~15, which is most likely caused by novel planar defects in the crystal, similar to CaKFe$_4$As$_4$. Jc characteristics in (Ca$_{1-x}$La$_x$)KFe$_4$As$_4$ with disorder outside FeAs planes is compared with that in CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_4$As$_4$ with disorder within FeAs planes.

# Floquet-Bloch Valleytronics

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03935

arXiv:2412.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving quantum materials out-of-equilibrium makes it possible to generate states of matter inaccessible through standard equilibrium tuning methods. Upon time-periodic coherent driving of electrons using electromagnetic fields, the emergence of Floquet-Bloch states enables the creation and control of exotic quantum phases. In transition metal dichalcogenides, broken inversion symmetry within each monolayer results in a non-zero Berry curvature at the K and K$^{\prime}$ valley extrema, giving rise to chiroptical selection rules that are fundamental to valleytronics. Here, we bridge the gap between these two concepts and introduce Floquet-Bloch valleytronics. Using time- and polarization-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy combined with state-of-the-art ab initio theory, we demonstrate the formation of valley-polarized Floquet-Bloch states in 2H-WSe$_2$ upon below-bandgap coherent electron driving with chiral light pulses. We investigate quantum path interference between Floquet-Bloch and Volkov states, showing that this interferometric process depends on the valley pseudospin and light polarization-state. Conducting extreme ultraviolet photoemission circular dichroism in these nonequilibrium settings reveals the potential for controlling the orbital character of Floquet-engineered states. These findings link Floquet engineering and quantum geometric light-matter coupling in two-dimensional materials. They can serve as a guideline for reaching novel out-of-equilibrium phases of matter by dynamically breaking symmetries through coherent dressing of winding Bloch electrons with tailored light pulses.

arXiv:2412.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics and multiferroics have attracted considerable scientific and technological interest in recent years due to the increasing demands for miniaturization and low energy consumption of electronic devices. At present, the research on 2D ferroelectrics and multiferroics is still focused on van der Waals materials, while the known bulk ferroelectric and multiferroic materials are mostly found in perovskite systems. The ability to prepare and transfer 2D perovskite oxides has provided unprecedented opportunities for developing ferroelectrics and multiferroics based on 2D perovskites. In this Perspective, we review the research progress on 2D ferroelectrics and multiferroics in inorganic perovskites in terms of different ferroelectric and magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms. The improper ferroelectricity and novel magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms discovered in 2D perovskites are emphasized, and then, the main challenges and future development direction are put forward.

# Transport Signatures of Radial Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling at Ferromagnet/Superconductor Interfaces

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03994

arXiv:2412.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emerging at the interfaces of superconducting magnetic tunnel junctions is at the heart of multiple unprecedented physical phenomena, covering triplet proximity effects induced by unconventional (spin-flip) Andreev reflections, giant transport magnetoansiotropies, sizable tunneling anomalous Hall effects, and electrically controlled current-reversing $ 0 $--$ \pi $(-like) transitions in Josephson contacts. Recent first-principles calculations proposed that the Rashba spin-orbit fields in twisted graphene/transition-metal dichalcogenide and van-der-Waals multilayers can -- owing to broken mirror symmetries -- exhibit an unconventional radial component (with spin parallel to the electron's momentum), which can be quantified by the Rashba angle $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $. We theoretically explore the ramifications of radial Rashba SOC at the interfaces of vertical ferromagnet/superconductor tunnel junctions with a focus on the magnetoanisotropies of the tunneling and tunneling-anomalous-Hall-effect conductances. Our results demonstrate that $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $ can be experimentally extracted from respective magnetization-angle shifts, providing a practical way to probe the radial Rashba SOC induced by twisted multilayers that are placed as tunneling barrier between ferromagnetic and superconducting electrodes.

Abstract: Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of $\sim$25 K, is a unique material that exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{FM} \approx 19$ K. The interplay between the two leads to a narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and the spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure directly controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ we observe a pronounced temperature-dependent peak in both the coercivity and the creep activation energy, the latter becoming rapidly suppressed in large applied magnetic fields. We attribute this behaviour to the formation of vortex polarons arising from the unique interaction between free vortices and magnetic stripe domains. We present a theoretical description of the properties of vortex polarons that explains our main observations, showing how they lead to vortex trapping and an attractive vortex-vortex interaction at short distances. In stark contrast, strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures is linked to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work reveals unexplored new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with particularly important applications in high-current conductors for operation at high magnetic fields.

# Restricted Boltzmann machine network versus Jastrow correlated wave function for the two-dimensional Hubbard model

## 二维Hubbard模型的受限玻尔兹曼机网络与Jastrow相关波函数

Abstract: We consider a restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) correlated BCS wave function as the ground state of the two-dimensional Hubbard model and study its electronic and magnetic properties as a function of hole doping. We compare the results with those obtained by using conventional Jastrow projectors. The results show that the RBM wave function outperforms the Jastrow projected ones in the underdoped region inmterms of the variational energy. Computation of superconducting (SC) correlations in the model shows that the RBM wave function gives slightly weaker SC correlations as compared to the Jastrow projected wave functions. A significant advantage of the RBM wave function is that it spontaneously gives rise to strong antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations in the underdoped region even though the wave function does not incorporate any explicit AF order. In comparison, AF correlations in the Jastrow projected wave functions are found to be very weak. These and other results obtained show that the RBM wave function provides an improved description of the phase diagram of the model. The work also demonstrates the power of neural-network quantum state (NQS) wave functions in the study of strongly correlated electron systems.

Abstract: Vanadium silicide (V$_3$Si) is a promising superconductor for integration with silicon-based electronics, however the interfacial growth kinetics have a strong influence on the resulting superconducting properties and are not yet fully understood. In this study, we have used neutron reflectometry to reveal the phase transformation during thin film growth driven by different annealing strategies. We examined the silicide formation when a thin layer of vanadium undergoes reactive diffusion with a silicon dioxide film on silicon at temperatures from 650-800 {\deg}C. To further investigate the time evolution of different phases under various annealing temperatures, a chemical model was developed and subsequent simulations were performed. The results of this model were validated using X-ray diffraction and cross-sectional TEM analysis. Correlations were observed between the structure and superconducting properties. Over-annealing films leads to complete depletion of the SiO$_2$ barrier layer, forming diffuse interfaces and driving the formation of undesirable silicon-rich silicides. Avoiding this by controlling time and temperature, allows higher quality superconducting films to be achieved. The $T_c$ of the films was found to be 13 K, and the annealing conditions influenced the critical fields and the paramagnetic Meissner effect near $T_c$. For optimally-annealed films, superconducting order parameters were calculated. Ginzberg-Landau theory was applied to explain flux penetration.

# Four-fold Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Antiferromagnetic Epitaxial Thin Films of MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$

Abstract: Antiferromagnets are emerging as promising alternatives to ferromagnets in spintronics applications. A key feature of antiferromagnets is their anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), which has the potential to serve as a sensitive marker for the antiferromagnetic order parameter. However, the underlying origins of this behavior remain poorly understood. In this study, we report the observation of AMR in epitaxial thin films of the collinear L1$_{0}$ antiferromagnet MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$. In thicker films, the AMR is dominated by a non-crystalline two-fold component. As the film thickness is reduced, however, a crystalline four-fold component emerges, accompanied by the appearance of uncompensated magnetic moment, which strongly modifies the magnetotransport properties in the thinner films. We demonstrate that interfacial interactions lead to a large density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level. This enhanced DOS, combined with disorder in thinner films, stabilizes the uncompensated moment and induces a four-fold modulation of the DOS as the Neel vector rotates, explaining the observed AMR behavior.

arXiv:2412.04308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantitative prediction of the finite-temperature properties of a phase transitioning system has been a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics and materials science. Here we regard a collective vector mode as essential quasiparticle excitation of the displacive ferroelectricity. Starting from the quantum statistic description of this excitation, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition theory of displacive ferroelectricity. This theory enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions, in a striking contrast to the widely used Landau-Ginzburg phenomenological description near the critical point. Its applications to the quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$ as well as the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured critical behaviors of the phase transitions and the corresponding dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases without fitting parameters. The theory should be general and can be utilized to understand a broad range of phase transitions in other bosonic systems.

# Strange metal transport from coupling to fluctuating spins

arXiv:2412.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals hosting strong electronic interactions, including high-temperature superconductors, behave in ways that do not conform to the normal Fermi liquid theory. To pinpoint the microscopic origin of this strange metal behavior, here we reexamine the transport and optical properties of the two-dimensional t-J model taking advantage of recent improvements made on the finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM), enabling numerically exact calculations at unprecedentedly low temperatures and high spectral resolution. We find that strange metallicity is pervasive in the temperature-doping phase diagram wherever magnetic order is suppressed: it is driven by the presence of a fluctuating spin background, and it is therefore independent on hole concentration and unrelated to quantum criticality. Our results point to a two-step transport mechanism, with short- and long-time processes associated respectively with the charge and spin dynamics, the latter being responsible for both the strange metal character and the unconventional optical conductivities seen in experiments.

Abstract: The experimental study of magnetism on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice has been ongoing for more than two decades, following the discovery of the first Shastry-Sutherland lattice materials SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. However, the study of Shastry-Sutherland systems is often complicated by the requirements of high magnetic fields ($>$~20~T SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$) or the presence of itinerate electrons (e.g. REB$_4$). In this paper, we present the magnetic properties of the Shastry-Sutherland lattice material Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$. Like SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ exhibits fractionalized magnetization plateaus. Unlike SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ exhibits long-range order below $\sim1~$K, and the plateaus are accessible using commercial laboratory equipment, occurring for fields <~1~T. The fractions of magnetization present are closest to $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ of the full powder moment; we show that the $\frac{1}{4}$ magnetization plateau in Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ has a classical analog, well represented by the magnetic structure (canted antiferromagnetic) observed in powder neutron diffraction. The lack of itinerate electrons, chemical disorder, and the low fields required to access the fractionalized magnetization plateaus promises Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ to be a prime candidate for the study of frustrated magnetism on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice.

# The spin-phonon relaxation mechanism of single-molecule magnets in the presence of strong exchange coupling

## 强交换耦合下单分子磁体的自旋声子弛豫机制

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04362

arXiv:2412.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic relaxation in coordination compounds is largely dominated by the interaction of the spin with phonons. Large zero-field splitting and exchange coupling values have been empirically found to strongly suppress spin relaxation and have been used as the main guideline for designing new molecular compounds. Although a comprehensive understanding of spin-phonon relaxation has been achieved for mononuclear complexes, only a qualitative picture is available for polynuclear compounds. Here we fill this critical knowledge gap by providing a full first-principle description of spin-phonon relaxation in an air-stable Co(II) dimer with both large single-ion anisotropy and exchange coupling. Simulations reproduce the experimental relaxation data with excellent accuracy and provide a microscopic understanding of Orbach and Raman relaxation pathways and their dependency on exchange coupling, zero-field splitting, and molecular vibrations. Theory and numerical simulations show that increasing cluster nuclearity to just four cobalt units would lead to a complete suppression of Raman relaxation. These results hold a general validity for single-molecule magnets, providing a deeper understanding of their relaxation and revised strategies for their improvement.

Abstract: Magnetization noise measurements on the spin ice Dy${}_2$Ti${}_2$O${}_7$ have revealed a remarkable `pink noise' power spectrum $S(f,T)$ below 4 K, including evidence of magnetic monopole excitations diffusing in a fractal landscape. However, at higher temperatures, the reported values of the anomalous exponent $b(T)$ describing the high frequency tail of $S(f,T)$ are not easy to reconcile with other results in the literature, which generally suggest significantly smaller deviations from the Brownian motion value of $b=2$, that become negligible above $T=20$ K. We accurately estimate $b(T)$ at temperatures between 2~K and 20~K, using a.c. susceptibility measurements that, crucially, stretch up to the relatively high frequency of $f = 10^6$ Hz. We show that previous noise measurements underestimate $b(T)$ and we suggest reasons for this. Our results establish deviations in $b(T)$ from $b=2$ up to about 20 K. However studies on different samples confirms that $b(T)$ is sample dependent: the details of this dependence agree in part, though not completely, with previous studies of the effect of crystal defects on monopole population and diffusion. Our results establish the form of $b(T)$ which characterises the subtle, and evolving, nature of monopole diffusion in the dense Coulomb fluid, a highly correlated state, where several dynamical processes combine. They do not rule out the importance of a fractal landscape picture emerging at lower temperatures where the monopole gas is dilute.

# Effects of non-integrability in a non-Hermitian time crystal

## 非厄米时间晶体的不可积效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04382

arXiv:2412.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystals are systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, exhibiting repeating patterns in time. Recent work has shown that non-Hermitian Floquet systems can host a time crystalline phase with quasi-long-range order. In this work, we investigate the effect of introducing a non-integrable interaction term into this non-Hermitian time crystal model. Using a combination of numerical TEBD simulations, mean-field analysis, and perturbation theory, we find that the interaction term has two notable effects. First, it induces a shift in the phase diagram, moving the boundaries between different phases. Second, a sufficiently strong interaction induces an unexpected symmetry-breaking transition, which is not captured by the mean-field approach. Within average Hamiltonian theory, we trace this back to a ferromagnetic transition in the anisotropic non-Hermitian XXZ model. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and many-body interactions can lead to novel symmetry breaking.

arXiv:2412.03650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple circuit architecture for a dissipatively error corrected Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit. The device consists of a electromagnetic resonator with impedance $h/2e^2\approx 12.91\,{\rm k}\Omega$ connected to a Josephson junction with a voltage bias oscillating at twice the resonator frequency. For large drive amplitudes, the circuit is effectively described by the GKP stabilizer Hamiltonian, whose low-energy subspace forms the code space for a qubit protected against phase-space local noise. The GKP states in the codespace can be dissipatively stabilized and error corrected by coupling the resonator to a bath through a bandpass filter; a resulting side-band cooling effect stabilizes the system in the GKP code space, dissipatively correcting it against both bit and phase flip errors. Simulations show that this dissipative error correction can enhance coherence time by factor $\sim 1000$ with NbN-based junctions, for operating temperatures in the $\sim 100\,{\rm mK}$ range. The scheme can be used to stabilize both square- and hexagonal-lattice GKP codes. Finally, a Josephson current based readout scheme, and dissipatively corrected single-qubit Clifford gates are proposed.

arXiv:2412.04165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The separation of physical forces acting on the tip of a magnetic force microscope (MFM) is essential for correct magnetic imaging. Electrostatic forces can be modulated by varying the tip-sample potential and minimized to map the local Kelvin potential. However, distinguishing magnetic forces from van der Waals forces typically requires two measurements with opposite tip magnetizations under otherwise identical measurement conditions. Here, we present an inverted magnetic force microscope where the sample is mounted on a flat cantilever for force sensing, and the magnetic tip is attached to a miniaturized electromagnet that periodically flips the tip magnetization. This setup enables the extraction of magnetic tip-sample interactions from the sidebands occurring at the switching rate in the cantilever oscillation spectrum. Our method achieves the separation of magnetic signals from other force contributions in a single-scan mode. Future iterations of this setup may incorporate membrane, trampoline, or string resonators with ultra-high quality factors, potentially improving measurement sensitivity by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art MFM systems using cantilevers.

arXiv:2312.15733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the physics of dilute magnetic impurities in a two-dimensional altermagnetic metal. For the single impurity case, although the spin degeneracy is broken in an altermagnetic metal, we show that the antiferromagnetic Kondo coupling still flows to the strong coupling regime at low energies in terms of the one-loop renormalization-group equation. Moreover, the Kondo temperature may be enhanced or reduced, depending on the band structure and the electron density. To study the ground-state properties, we employ the variational wavefunction approach. We find that the impurity spin is completely screened at long distances, in contrast to the usual antiferromagnet. The $d$-wave nature of the spin-split Fermi surfaces in an altermagnetic metal is reflected in the correlation between the impurity and conduction electron spins, which exhibits the $C_{4z}$ symmetry of the altermagnet at long distances. The spin correlation decays as $1/r^3$ at long distances, and its amplitude oscillates with four different periods due to the interference between the spin splitting Fermi surfaces. Moreover, the values of these periods depend on the direction of observation. Similar phenomena also occur in the RKKY interaction in an AM metal.

Abstract: Supersolid is an exotic quantum state of matter that spontaneously hosts the features of both solid and superfluid, which breaks the translation and U(1) gauge symmetries. Here we study the spin dynamics in the triangular-lattice compound Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, which is revealed in [Xiang et al., Nature 625, 270-275 (2024)] as a quantum magnetic analog of supersolid. We simulate the easy-axis Heisenberg model with tensor network approach and uncover unique dynamic traits. These features are manifested in two branches of excitations that can be associated with the spin solidity and superfluidity, respectively. One branch contains the U(1) Goldstone and roton modes, while the other comprises pseudo-Goldstone and roton modes. The gapless Goldstone modes of the in-plane superfluid order are confirmed by our inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Together with the evident out-of-plane solid order indicated by the magnetic Bragg peaks, our findings provide spectroscopic evidence for spin supersolidity in this easy-axis antiferromagnet. Akin to the role of phonon-roton modes -- Landau elementary excitations -- in shaping the helium superfluid thermodynamics, the intriguing double magnon-roton dispersion here determines the low-temperature thermodynamics of spin supersolid down to sub-Kelvin regime, explaining the recently observed giant magnetocaloric effect in Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$.

Abstract: The magnetic ground state is crucial for the applications of the two-dimension magnets as it decides fundamental magnetic properties of the material, such as magnetic order, magnetic transition temperature, and low-energy excitation of the spin waves. However, the simulations for magnetism of local-electron systems are challenging due to the existence of metastable states. In this study, occupation matrix control (OMC) and density functional theory plus Hubbard $U$ calculations are applied to investigate the magnetic ground state of monolayer CeI$_{2}$. Following the predicted ferromagnetic (FM) order, the FM ground state and the FM metastable states are identified and found to have different values of the magnetic parameters. Based on the calculated magnetic parameters of the FM ground state, the Curie temperature is estimated to be $128$ K for monolayer CeI$_{2}$. When spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is considered, the FM ground state is further confirmed to contain both off-plane and in-plane components of magnetization. SOC is shown to be essential for reasonably describing not only magnetic anisotropy but also local electronic orbital state of monolayer CeI$_{2}$.

Reduced values of the ordered moments may indicate significant quantum fluctuations in this effective spin-1/2 geometrically frustrated magnet.

arXiv:2406.03416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions by means of mean-field approximations, spin-wave theory, and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm and concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The hyperbolic lattices have an extensive number of sites on the boundary, such that one has to distinguish between bulk and total density of states (DOS). The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac-like total DOS, Schl\"afli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac total DOS cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ metal-to-insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Gross-Neveu transition in Euclidean space. We argue that this transition is induced by the open-boundary conditions and that it will be absent in the periodic case. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. This conclusion holds even though the bulk DOS is constant at the Fermi energy for the three considered lattices. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time-reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: While spin-wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.

Abstract: The idea to extract information on magnetically different phases from magnetic measurements is very attractive and many efforts have been made in this area. One of the most popular direction is to use the Preisach model formalism to analyze the 2D Preisach distribution function (PDF) obtained either from first order reversal curves (FORC) or minor loops. Here we present an alternative a much simpler procedure - the analysis of the derivative of the saturation magnetization loop, the differential susceptibility curve. It follows the Lorentzian shape with very high accuracy for ferromagnetic polycrystalline materials. This allows decomposing any differential susceptibility curve of a complex multi-phase material into individual components representing different magnetic phases by Lorenzian peaks - in the same way as it is done in X-ray analysis of materials. We show that the minor differential susceptibility curves also have the Lorenzian shape that can facilitate calculation of the Preisach distribution function from the experimental curves and reduce noise in the resulting PDF.

Additionally, we calculate the phonon dynamics for acoustic phonons coupled to the Majorana fermion excitations of the Kitaev spin liquid state, discussing the temperature and field evolution of these quantities.

Abstract: In the Meissner phase of a superconductor below its critical temperature, an external constant magnetic field is shielded by circulating persistent supercurrents with zero resistance that are formed by Cooper pairs. However, a thermodynamic change of state within this phase at any finite temperature and at finite speed, such as a cooling or a heating, inevitably generates normal currents of thermally excited unpaired charge carriers. These currents are induced by the time-dependent variations in the local magnetic-flux density associated with the imposed change of state. They may not only lead to certain deviations of the magnetic-field distribution from textbook Meissner profiles, but also cause dissipative Joule heating, which appears to be at odds with the expected reversibility in a truly thermodynamic superconducting state. We show that these normal currents also produce a magnetocaloric cooling, which in total instantaneously and precisely compensates for the dissipated heat, thus ensuring overall energy conservation and reversibility in terms of energy. However, the time-dependent Joule heating and magnetocaloric cooling processes are spatially distinct and therefore result in small temperature inhomogeneities that only fade away towards thermodynamic equilibrium after the thermodynamic change of state has halted.

Abstract: Motivated by the rapid experimental progress on the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets, we propose a generic effective spin model that describes interacting non-Kramers local moments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. We point out that the local moments consist of both magnetic dipole and quadrupole components and the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model with an intrinsic field that accounts for the crystal field splitting. We then study the ground-state phase diagram of the model and find that pure quadrupole orders, which are invisible to conventional experimental probes, can be stabilized over a broad regime. In particular, we show that a hidden ``1/3 magnetization plateau'' with quadrupole orders generally exists and discuss its experimental signatures. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results to the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets Pr$_{2}$Ga$_{2}$BeO$_{7}$ and Pr$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$.

Abstract: Moats in superconducting ground planes are used to trap magnetic flux away from sensitive parts of superconductor integrated circuits. We simulate the effect of magnetic flux trapped in moats on the operating margins of ac-biased SFQ shift registers (ShReg) with two ground planes for various congruent moat geometries, moat sizes, locations in the ShReg cells, number and polarity of the trapped of fluxons. Using inductance extractor InductEx, we extract mutual couplings between the moats and the ShReg inductors and include them in the refined netlist. Then, we use JoSim to simulate the circuit operation and find the threshold ac clock amplitude above which the register starts to operate correctly. The relative change in this threshold is used to characterize the influence of flux trapping on the circuit operation. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to investigate the effect of the circuit parameter variations on the statistics of the threshold, using the standard deviation of the Josephson junction critical current and of the circuit inductance extracted from the fabrication process control monitors. The obtained distributions are compared with the independently measured distributions of the threshold amplitude for the individual cells of ac-biased shift registers with 108,500 Josephson junctions. The results show that flux trapping in properly designed moats have a very small effect on the operation margins of the large-scale shift registers whereas the main contribution to the cell-to-cell variation of the threshold comes from the variation of the junctions' critical currents.

Abstract: In some models of nonequilibrium phase transitions, fluctuations of the analyzed currents have been observed to diverge with system size. To assess whether this behavior is universal across phase transitions, we examined heat current fluctuations in the Curie-Weiss model, a paradigmatic model of the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition, coupled to two thermal baths. This model exhibits phase transitions driven by both the temperature and the magnetic field. We find that at the temperature-driven phase transition, the heat current noise consists of two contributions: the equilibrium part, which vanishes with system size, and the nonequilibrium part, which diverges with system size. For small temperature differences, this leads to nonmonotonic scaling of fluctuations with system size. In contrast, at the magnetic-field-driven phase transition, heat current fluctuations do not diverge when observed precisely at the phase transition point. Instead, out of equilibrium, the noise is enhanced at the magnetic field values away but close to the phase transition point, due to stochastic switching between two current values. The maximum value of noise increases exponentially with system size, while the position of this maximum shifts towards the phase transition point. Finally, on the methodological side, the paper demonstrates that current fluctuations in large systems can be effectively characterized by combining a path integral approach for macroscopic fluctuations together with an effective two-state model describing subextensive transitions between the two macroscopic states involved in the phase transition.

Here we present a novel method that provides access to photon statistics resolved in space and frequency in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. Within the macroscopic QED framework, we develop a practical tool to compute electric field correlations for complex quantum systems by including lossy two-level systems that act as field detectors within the system. To make the implementation feasible, we use a recently developed multi-emitter few-mode quantization method to correctly account for fully retarded light propagation to the detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique by studying the photon correlations of one and two emitters in close proximity to a plasmonic nanoparticle. The simulations show that even in these relatively simple configurations, the light statistics exhibit a strong angular dependence. These results highlight the importance of going beyond conventional quantum-optical approaches to fully capture the analyzed physical effects and enable the study of the quantum light generation in realistic nanophotonic devices.

# Validation of NSFsim as a Grad-Shafranov Equilibrium Solver at DIII-D

## NSFsim作为grad-shafranov平衡求解器在diii-d上的验证

arXiv:2412.03786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma shape is a significant factor that must be considered for any Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP) as it has significant consequences for plasma stability and core confinement. A new simulator, NSFsim, has been developed based on a historically successful code, DINA, offering tools to simulate both transport and plasma shape. Specifically, NSFsim is a free boundary equilibrium and transport solver and has been configured to match the properties of the DIII-D tokamak. This paper is focused on validating the Grad-Shafranov (GS) solver of NSFsim by analyzing its ability to recreate the plasma shape, the poloidal flux distribution, and the measurements of the simulated diagnostic signals originating from flux loops and magnetic probes in DIII-D. Five different plasma shapes are simulated to show the robustness of NSFsim to different plasma conditions; these shapes are Lower Single Null (LSN), Upper Single Null (USN), Double Null (DN), Inner Wall Limited (IWL), and Negative Triangularity (NT). The NSFsim results are compared against real measured signals, magnetic profile fits from EFIT, and another plasma equilibrium simulator, GSevolve. EFIT reconstructions of shots are readily available at DIII-D, but GSevolve was manually ran by us to provide simulation data to compare against.

arXiv:2412.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development of a decay energy spectroscopy (DES) method for the analysis of radioactive impurities using magnetic microcalorimeters (MMCs). The DES system was designed to analyze radionuclides, such as Ra-226, Th-228, and their daughter nuclides, in materials like copper, commonly used in rare-event search experiments. We tested the DES system with a gold foil absorber measuring 20x20x0.05 mm^3, large enough to accommodate a significant drop of source solution. Using this large absorber and an MMC sensor, we conducted a long-term measurement over ten days of live time, requiring 11 ADR cooling cycles. The combined spectrum achieved an energy resolution of 45 keV FWHM, sufficient to identify most alpha and DES peaks of interest. Specific decay events from radionuclide contaminants in the absorber were identified. This experiment confirms the capability of the DES system to measure alpha decay chains of Ra-226 and Th-228, offering a promising method for radio-impurity evaluation in ultra-low background experiments.

# Differential Magnetic Force Microscopy with a Switchable Tip

## 具有可切换尖端的差分磁力显微镜

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04165

arXiv:2412.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The separation of physical forces acting on the tip of a magnetic force microscope (MFM) is essential for correct magnetic imaging. Electrostatic forces can be modulated by varying the tip-sample potential and minimized to map the local Kelvin potential. However, distinguishing magnetic forces from van der Waals forces typically requires two measurements with opposite tip magnetizations under otherwise identical measurement conditions. Here, we present an inverted magnetic force microscope where the sample is mounted on a flat cantilever for force sensing, and the magnetic tip is attached to a miniaturized electromagnet that periodically flips the tip magnetization. This setup enables the extraction of magnetic tip-sample interactions from the sidebands occurring at the switching rate in the cantilever oscillation spectrum. Our method achieves the separation of magnetic signals from other force contributions in a single-scan mode. Future iterations of this setup may incorporate membrane, trampoline, or string resonators with ultra-high quality factors, potentially improving measurement sensitivity by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art MFM systems using cantilevers.

# Symmetry-Based Classification of Chern Phases in Honeycomb Photonic Crystals

arXiv:2412.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a symmetry-based classification of Chern phases in honeycomb photonic crystals, considering arbitrary nonreciprocal couplings compatible with energy conservation. Our analysis focuses on crystals formed through nonreciprocal perturbations of photonic graphene. These perturbations, which can have arbitrary spatial variations, are generally described by scalar and vector fields. Using a tight-binding model, we consider the most general nonreciprocal interactions, including gyromagnetic, pseudo-Tellegen, and moving medium responses, and examine how the corresponding nonreciprocal fields influence the crystal's topology. Our findings reveal that nonreciprocal interactions alone are insufficient to induce a topologically nontrivial phase. Instead, a nontrivial p6m component in the nonreciprocal fields is required to open a bandgap and achieve a non-zero Chern number. These results provide a symmetry-based roadmap for engineering photonic topological phases via nonreciprocal perturbations of photonic graphene, offering practical guidelines for designing topological phases in graphene-like photonic crystals.

arXiv:2412.03288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous theories have postulated the existence of exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Spin-based quantum sensors, which utilize the quantum properties of spins to enhance measurement precision, emerge as powerful tools for probing these exotic interactions. These sensors encompass a wide range of technologies, such as optically pumped magnetometers, atomic comagnetometers, spin masers, nuclear magnetic resonance, spin amplifiers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These technologies stand out for their ultrahigh sensitivity, compact tabletop design, and cost-effectiveness, offering complementary approaches to the large-scale particle colliders and astrophysical observations. This article reviews the underlying physical principles of various spin sensors and highlights the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with these quantum sensors. Investigations covered include the exotic interactions of spins with ultralight dark matter, exotic spin-dependent forces, electric dipole moment, spin-gravity interactions, and among others. Ongoing and forthcoming experiments using advanced spin-based sensors to investigate exotic spin-dependent interactions are discussed.

arXiv:2412.03645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy-cluster virial (structure-formation accretion) shock observations are shown to imply $\gtrsim1\%$ magnetization of a layer extending $\gtrsim10^{16}$ Debye lengths downstream, challenging the modelling of high Alfv\'en-Mach collisionless shocks. Unlike similar shocks in supernova remnants or relativistic shocks in $\gamma$-ray burst afterglows, where macroscopic magnetized layers were detected but purportedly attributed to preexisting or non-resonant cosmic-ray streaming-seeded substructure, the upstream of strong virial shocks is both weakly magnetized and pristine. Hence, some mechanism must generate large-scale and possibly self-similar magnetic sub-structure out of the accreted primordial plasma; such a mechanism may dominate other high-Mach shock systems, too.

Abstract: Intermittent magnetic structures are a plausible candidate for explaining cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion rates derived from observed CR energy spectra. Independently, studies of extreme scattering events (ESEs) of radio quasars and pulsar scintillation have hinted that very straight, large-aspect-ratio, magnetic current sheets may be responsible for the localized large scattering of radio waves. The required shortest axis of the typical structures producing ESEs is of the same scale ($\sim$AU) as the gyroradii of $\sim$GeV CRs. In this paper, we propose that the same magnetic/density sheets can produce large scattering of both CRs and radio waves. We demonstrate that the geometry and volume filling factor of the sheets derived from quasar ESEs can explain the observed mean free path of GeV CRs without introducing free parameters. The model places constraints on the sheet geometry, such as straightness and large aspect ratio, and assumes the statistics of the sheets are similar throughout the Galactic volume. We, therefore, discuss observational tests of the sheet model, which includes observations of echoes in pulsars and fast radio bursts, gravitationally lensed quasars, the distribution of ESE durations, and spatial correlations between ESE events and rotation-measure fluctuations. Such tests will be enabled by upcoming wide-field radio instruments, including Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) and Deep Synoptic Array 2000 Antennas (DSA-2000).

# Non-linear Faraday Precession of Light Polarization in Time-Reversal Invariant Materials

## 时间反转不变材料中光偏振的非线性法拉第进动

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03656

arXiv:2412.03656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through materials displaying a non-linear Hall effect. The coupled Maxwell-Boltzmann equations for traveling waves can be mapped onto ordinary differential equations that resemble those for the motion of a pendulum. In the weakly non-linear regime relevant for most experiments, we find that the polarization of light displays a Faraday-like precession of its polarization direction that swings back and forth around the direction of Berry dipole vector as the light beam traverses the material. This occurs concomitantly with an oscillation of its degree of polarization, with a characteristic frequency that increases linearly with the intensity of the traveling wave. These effects could be observed by measuring thickness dependent Faraday rotations as well as the emission of lower frequency radiation associated with the polarization oscillations in materials displaying the non-linear Hall effect.

arXiv:2412.03945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let two test particles A and B revolving about a spinning primary along ideally identical orbits in opposite directions be considered. From the general expressions of the precessions of the orbital inclination induced by the post-Newtonian gravitomagnetic and Newtonian quadrupolar fields of the central object, it turns out that the Lense-Thirring inclination rates of A and B are equal and opposite, while the Newtonian ones due to the primary's oblateness are identical. Thus, the difference of the inclination shifts of the two orbiters would allow, in principle, to cancel out the classical effects by enhancing the general relativistic ones. The conditions affecting the orbital configurations that must be satisfied for this to occur and possible observable consequences in the field of Earth are investigated. In particular, a scenario involving two spacecraft in polar orbits, branded POLAr RElativity Satellites (POLARES) and reminiscent of an earlier proposal by Van Patten and Everitt in the mid-1970s, is considered. A comparison with the ongoing experiment with the LAser GEOdynamics Satellite (LAGEOS) and LAser RElativity Satellite (LARES) 2 is made.

# Frequency-tunable biphoton generation via spontaneous four-wave mixing

## 通过自发四波混频产生频率可调的双光子

arXiv:2412.04127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental results on tuning biphoton frequency by introducing a detuned coupling field in spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), and examine its impact on the pairing ratio. This tunability is achieved by manipulating the inherent electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in the double-$\Lambda$ scheme. Introducing a detuned coupling field degrades the efficiency of EIT-based stimulated four-wave mixing, which in turn reduces the biphoton pairing ratio. However, this reduction can be mitigated by increasing the optical power of the coupling field. Additionally, we observe that blue- and red-detuning the biphoton frequency results in distinct temporal profiles of biphoton wavepackets due to phase mismatch. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of frequency-tunable biphoton generation via SFWM, and suggest potential optimizations for applications in quantum communication and information processing.

# Ionospheric conductances at the giant planets of the Solar System:a comparative study of ionization sources and the impact of meteoric ions

arXiv:2412.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of giant planet magnetospheres is controlled by a complex interplay between their fast rotation, their interaction with the solar wind, and their diverse internal plasma and momentum sources. In the ionosphere, the Hall and Pedersen conductances are two key parameters that regulate the intensity of currents coupling the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, and the rate of angular momentum transfer and power carried by these currents. We perform a comparative study of Hall and Pedersen conductivities and conductances in the four giant planets of our Solar System - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. We use a generic ionospheric model (restraining the studied ions to H3+, CH5+, and meteoric ions) to study the dependence of conductances on the structure and composition of these planets' upper atmospheres and on the main ionization sources (photoionization, ionization by precipitating electrons, and meteoroid ablation). After checking that our model reproduces the conclusions of Nakamura et al. (2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JA030312) at Jupiter, i.e. the contribution of meteoric ions to the height-integrated conductances is non-negligible, we show that this contribution could also be non-negligible at Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, compared with ionization processes caused by precipitating electrons of energies lower than a few keV (typical energies on these planets). However, because of their weaker magnetic field, the conductive layer of these planets is higher than the layer where meteoric ions are mainly produced, limiting their role in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.

Abstract: Modulating macroscopic parameters of materials in time offers innovative avenues for manipulating electromagnetic waves. Due to such enticing prospects, the general research subject of time-varying systems is expanding today in different branches of electromagnetism and optics. However, compared with the research efforts and progresses that have taken place in the realm of classical electrodynamics, the quantum aspects of this emerging subject have been less explored. Here, through the lens of quantum optics, we study the scattering of electromagnetic fields from an isotropic and nondispersive material with a suddenly changing refractive index, creating a time interface. We revisit the transformation of the bosonic mode operators and corresponding quantum states due to this interface, governed by the two-mode squeeze operator. Building on this foundation, more importantly, our analysis focuses on the photon statistics and quantum state engineering of the scattered light, elucidating various quantum optical phenomena and opportunities arising from the time interface. Notably, these include photon-pair production and destruction, photon bunching and antibunching, vacuum generation, quantum state discrimination, and quantum state freezing. To bridge theory and experiment, we propose a possible circuit quantum electrodynamics approach for validating our theoretical predictions. We hope that our work inspires experimental investigations and further quantum optical explorations of electromagnetic field interaction with photonic time crystals or with dispersive time-varying materials.

# Considerations about the measurement of the magnetic moment and electric dipole moment of the electron

Abstract: The goal of the measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron $\mu$, is to experimentaly determine the gyromagnetic ratio. The factor $g/2$ is computed by the accurate measurement of two frequencies, the spin precession frequency $\nu_s$, and the cyclotron frequency $\nu_c$, and is defined as $\nu_s/\nu_c=g/2$. These experiments are performed with a single electron confined inside a Penning trap. The existence of the electric dipole moment ${\bf d}_e$, involves the idea of an asymmetric charge distribution along the spin direction such that ${\bf d}_e=d_e{\bf S}/(\hbar/2)$. The energy shift $\Delta U=2{d}_eE_{eff}$ of the interaction of the electric dipole of electrons with a huge effective electric field ${\bf E}_{eff}$, close to the nucleus of heavy neutral atoms or molecules, is calculated by a spin precession measurement and the value $d_e$ is determined. By using a classical model of a spinning electron, which satisfies Dirac's equation when quantized, we determine classically the time average value of the electric and magnetic dipole moments of this electron model when moving in a uniform magnetic field and in a Penning trap, with the same fields as in the real experiments, and obtain an estimated value of these dipoles. We compare these results with the experimental data and make some interpretation of the measured dipoles. The conclusion is that experiments do not measure what they purport to measure.

Abstract: Future lepton colliders such as the FCC-ee, CEPC, ILC, or a muon collider will collect large data samples that allow precision physics studies with unprecedented accuracy, especially when the data is collected by innovative state-of-the-art detectors. An electromagnetic calorimeter based on scintillating crystals, designed to separately record Cherenkov and scintillation light, can achieve precision measurements of electrons and photons without sacrificing jet energy resolution, given adequate light collection efficiency and separation. This paper presents initial measurements from a program aimed at developing such a calorimeter system for future colliders. We focus on using PbF2 crystals to enhance the understanding of Cherenkov light collection, marking the first step in this endeavor.

Abstract: Interplanetary shocks are one of the crucial dynamic phenomena in the Heliosphere. They can accelerate particles to high energies, generate plasma waves, and can trigger geomagnetic storms in Earth's magnetosphere, significantly impacting technological infrastructure. In this study, two IP shock events are selected to study the temporal variations of the shock parameters using magnetometer and ion plasma measurements of the STEREO$-$A and B, the Wind, Cluster fleet, and the ACE spacecraft. The shock normal vectors are determined using the minimum variance analysis (MVA) and the magnetic coplanarity methods. During the May 7, 2007, event, the shock parameters and the shock normal direction remain consistent across each spacecraft crossing of the shock. The shock surface appears to be tilted almost the same degree as the Parker spiral, and the driver could be a Co$-$rotating Interaction Region (CIR). During the April 23, 2007 event, the shock parameters do not change significantly except for the shock angle $\theta_{B_{n}}$, however, the shape of the IP shock appears to be twisted along the perpendicular direction to the Sun-Earth line as well. The driver of this rippled shock is Stream Interaction Region (SIR)/CIR as well.

Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study temporal interfaces between media with strong spatial dispersion and dielectrics. In particular, we consider a temporal discontinuity that transforms a wire medium sample, a metamaterial with resonant spatial dispersion, into a uniaxial dielectric. We show that this transition results in a transformation of the deeply subwavelength spatial spectrum of TEM waves propagating in the wire medium at a certain frequency into a spectrum of plane waves at new frequencies that are all higher than the initial one. The waves at different frequencies propagate in different directions. Their complex amplitudes and propagation directions are uniquely related to the amplitudes of the spatial harmonics of the fields which existed before the transition. We explain how to implement this transition. The revealed effect may result in a promising method of subwavelength imaging.

# Stability of Crossed-Field Amplifiers

arXiv:2411.16066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research examines the stability of crossed-field amplifiers (CFAs) and characterizes their different modes of operation: amplification, driven oscillation, and self-excited oscillation. The CFA used in this paper is the Recirculating Planar Crossed-Field Amplifier (RPCFA), which is a high power (MW) pulsed (300 ns) amplifier that operates around 3 GHz. Initially, the RPCFA is shown to be a stable amplifier with moderate gain (5.1 dB), but by either reducing the anode-cathode (AK) gap spacing or increasing the driving current, the amplifier operation transitions from amplification to oscillation. Depending on the operating conditions, these oscillations are either driven by the input RF signal or self-excited. These self-excited oscillations can have a lower synchronization phase velocity than the maximum velocity in the electron beam, implying that slower electrons within the Brillouin hub can interact with electromagnetic modes on the RF circuit. A cold tube analysis of the RPCFA shows that the Q-factor of certain modes on the RF circuit varies significantly when the AK gap geometry of the RPCFA is altered which leads to a discrete shift in operating frequency. The operation of the RPCFA close to Hull cutoff is found to share some key features of magnetically insulated transmission line oscillators (MILO) that could also explain the dramatic frequency shift. Instantaneous phase analysis by Hilbert transforms can be used, in conjunction with the frequency and output power analysis, to determine the onset of the transition from amplification to oscillation, and to characterize the oscillation.

Abstract: Solid-state detectors with a low energy threshold have several applications, including searches of non-relativistic halo dark-matter particles with sub-GeV masses. When searching for relativistic, beyond-the-Standard-Model particles with enhanced cross sections for small energy transfers, a small detector with a low energy threshold may have better sensitivity than a larger detector with a higher energy threshold. In this paper, we calculate the low-energy ionization spectrum from high-velocity particles scattering in a dielectric material. We consider the full material response including the excitation of bulk plasmons. We generalize the energy-loss function to relativistic kinematics, and benchmark existing tools used for halo dark-matter scattering against electron energy-loss spectroscopy data. Compared to calculations commonly used in the literature, such as the Photo-Absorption-Ionization model or the free-electron model, including collective effects shifts the recoil ionization spectrum towards higher energies, typically peaking around 4--6 electron-hole pairs. We apply our results to the three benchmark examples: millicharged particles produced in a beam, neutrinos with a magnetic dipole moment produced in a reactor, and upscattered dark-matter particles. Our results show that the proper inclusion of collective effects typically enhances a detector's sensitivity to these particles, since detector backgrounds, such as dark counts, peak at lower energies.

We measured the masses and excitation energies, electromagnetic moments, and charge radii, and firmly established the nuclear spins of the long-lived states. A new isomer was discovered in $^{118}$Ag and the half-lives of $^{118}$Ag long-lived states were reevaluated. We unambiguously pinned down the level ordering of all long-lived states, placing the inversion of the $I = 0^-$ and $I = 4^+$ states at $A = 118$ $(N = 71)$. Lastly, we compared the electromagnetic moments of each state to empirical single-particle moments to identify the dominant configuration where possible.

Hexagonal layered Na2T2TeO6 (T = Co1/3Ni1/3Cu1/3) and Na2Z2TeO6 (Z = Co1/4Ni1/4Cu1/4Zn1/4) have been prepared by solid-state reactions. According to the X-ray Rietveld refinement, Na2Z2TeO6 is isostructural with its honeycomb-ordered constituents Na2M2TeO6 (M = Co, Zn), space group P6322. For Na2T2TeO6, however, only subcell (ignoring T/Te ordering) could be successfully refined despite presence of weak superstructure reflection. This is attributed to intergrowth of two packing modes with similar lattice parameters: P63/mcm (characteristic of Na2Ni2TeO6) and P6322. According to magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements, both materials undergo antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures with negative Weiss temperatures of −38 and −26 K for the T- and Z-compositions, respectively. The Néel point of Na2T2TeO6, 16.9 K, is considerably lower than those of its Ni and Co constituents (both being about 27 K), in contrast to the sister system, monoclinic Na3T2SbO6, where TN is intermediate between those of Ni and Co constituents. Further lowering of the Néel point in Na2Z2TeO6, 8.6 K, is attributed to the diamagnetic dilution with Zn2+.

# Quantifying the Reduction of Kinetic Overpotential on Magnetic Electrocatalysts under Magnetic Fields

The direct enhancement of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by a magnetic field is a novel strategy for high-efficiency alkaline water electrolysers. The influence of a magnetic field on either electrochemical equilibria or electron-transfer kinetics remains controversial, partially due to the difficulty of eliminating the mass-transfer related effects. In this work, a magneto-electrochemical system, which contains a thin-layer flow cell allowing a forced convection flow, is designed to decouple the magnetic effects on mass transfer from those on the reaction kinetics. When OER is catalyzed by magnetic materials, the active species on the surface, rather than the composition and magnetic property of the bulk material, determine the magneto-enhancement of the reaction kinetics. The enhancement at monometallic active sites follow the order Ni3+ < Co3+ < Fe3+, corresponding to the change in kinetic overpotential (ΔEk) of 2.7, 18.8, and 42.9 mV at 1 mA·cm-2, respectively. It was assumed that a magnetic field acts on the spin moments of active sites, leading to variations in the d-band center and the electrochemical equilibria. Here we show that the magneto-enhancement follows the same trend of the average spin moments in the order Ni < Co < Fe. Thus, the spin state of active sites determines the ΔEk on magnetic electrocatalysts.
