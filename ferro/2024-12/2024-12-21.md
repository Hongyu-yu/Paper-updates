arXiv:2412.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of superconductivity in the vicinity of insulating or Fermi surface reconstructed metallic states has established twisted bilayers of WSe$_2$ as an exciting platform to study the interplay of strong electron-electron interactions, broken symmetries and topology. In this work, we study the emergence of electronic ordering in twisted WSe$_2$ driven by gate-screened Coulomb interactions. Our first-principles treatment begins by constructing moir\'e Wannier orbitals that faithfully capture the bandstructure and topology of the system and project the gate-screened Coulomb interaction onto them. Using unbiased functional renormalization group calculations, we find an interplay between intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic order and chiral, mixed-parity $d/p$-wave superconductivity for carrier concentrations near the displacement field-tunable van-Hove singularity. Our microscopic approach establishes incommensurate intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations as the dominant electronic mechanism driving the formation of superconductivity in $\theta = 5.08^{\circ}$ twisted WSe$_2$ and demonstrates that nesting properties of the Fermi surface sheets near the higher-order van-Hove point cause an asymmetric density dependence of the spin ordering as the density is varied across the van-Hove line, in good agreement with experimental observations. We show how the region of superconducting and magnetic order evolves within the two-dimensional phase space of displacement field and electronic density as twist angle is varied between $4^{\circ} \dots 5^{\circ}$.

# Influence of Magnetic Anisotropy on the Ground State of [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Fe(HCOO)$_3$: Insights into the Improper Modulated Magnetic Structure

Abstract: The hybrid perovskites [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{x-1}$(HCOO)$_3$ with $x$ = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 possess multiple phase transitions including incommensurate structures. [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Ni(HCOO)$_3$ has also been found to have a proper magnetic incommensurate structure in its ground state. We have carried out a detailed structural characterization of the isomorphous [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Fe(HCOO)$_3$ (1) to investigate whether it also has incommensurate structural and magnetic modulations. We confirm that 1 crystallizes in the $Pnma$ space group at room temperature (RT) with a perovskite structure. Upon cooling, at about 170 K, the occurrence of new satellite reflections in the diffraction pattern show a phase transition to a modulated structure, which could be refined in the $Pnma(00\gamma)0s0$ super space group with $q_1~=~0.1662(2)c^\ast$. On further cooling to 75 K the satellite reflections become closer to the main reflections, indicating a new phase transition that keeps the super space group invariant but changes the modulation wave vector, $q_2~=~0.1425(2)c^\ast$. The structure then does not change structural phase down to base temperature (2 K). Magnetic susceptibility measurements collected under field-cooled and zero-field-cooled reveal a 3D antiferromagnetic order below 17 K. The overlapping in temperature between structural modulation and long-range magnetic order presents a unique opportunity to study magneto-structural coupling. Our results point to an improper modulated structure where interestingly the spins oriented strictly antiferromagnetic are perpendicular to those of previously reported compounds. In the present work, a combination of magnetometry measurements, single crystal and powder neutron diffraction and density functional theory calculations have been used to accurately determine and understand the sequence of nuclear and magnetic phases present in compound 1.

arXiv:2412.14381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.

Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.

Abstract: Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.

Abstract: A magnetic impurity in a BCS superconductor induces the formation of a Shiba state and drives a local quantum phase transition. We generalize this concept to a one-dimensional superconductor with fractionalized excitations, where the dominant instability is superconducting. In this framework, conduction electrons fractionalize into gapless charge and gapped spin excitations. We show that magnetic impurity interacts exclusively with the spin degrees of freedom and induces a quantum phase transition. Furthermore, charge excitations influence dynamical observables, giving rise to the phenomenon we term the fractionalized Shiba state. At zero temperature, the tunneling spectrum exhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of $-1/2$ at half filling, stemming from the gapless charge modes that form a standard Luttinger liquid. Extending this analysis to finite temperatures reveals that the spectral features retain universal behavior at the critical point.

Abstract: Magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators has been a field of much interest, while condensation in anti-ferromagnetic systems are yet to be explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: an easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type DMI interaction supports two condensate populations at finite wavevectors. The condensation state is stable only when the distribution of magnons between the two populations is symmetric. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without DMI interaction we predict that the magnons condensate will not be stabilized. The results indicate that the lack of stability is a general feature of single-component quasiparticle condensates.

arXiv:2412.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic resistance occurs in a superconducting tape carrying a dc transport current while being exposed to an alternating magnetic field. This effect is caused by flux movements interacting with the transport current. The dynamic resistance is already applied in many superconducting applications, for example superconducting flux pumps or persistent current switches. The resistance is highly dependent on the magnetic field and the frequency the superconductor is subjected to and its properties. When the dynamic resistance exceeds a certain value and thus enters the magnitude of the resistances of the normal conducting layers of the HTS tape, these normal conducting layers play a significant role in the total resistance of the tape. In this paper, modifications were made to the silver stabilizer and the total resistance of the HTS tape has been investigated. The experimental results with frequencies up to 1000 Hz and magnetic field up to 277 mT show significant increases in resistance. Additionally, a multilayer model based on H-formulation is presented to calculate the losses of the superconductor. The results also show significant heating due to the losses and therefore a temperature rise, which effects the measured total resistance. These results can be further used for applications where high switchable resistances are required with zero dc resistance when the magnet is turned off.

arXiv:2412.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed mathematically a model describing flux jumps in superconductivity in a 1D configuration. Three effects occur from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the equations showed that magnetic field fronts penetrate the material as inhomogeneous Burgers fronts. An additional global term pushes the magnetic field and is responsible for flux jumps. We considered a medium temperature for which the heat capacity of a sample can be taken as a constant and a low temperature where heat capacity depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. As expected, we found that flux jumps occur mostly at low temperature. To understand flux trapping, we examined external magnetic field pulses of different amplitudes and duration. We found that flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitudes and low temperatures.

Abstract: The development of laser science and technology have stimulated the study of condensed matter physics, especially, dynamical or non-equilibrium nature in solids. The laser technique in terahertz (THz) regime, whose photon energy is comparable to those of typical collective modes in solids such as magnetic excitations, phonons, etc., has remarkably proceeded in the last decade. Theoretical tools for non-equilibrium states have also progressed. Thanks to these backgrounds, magneto-optics, especially, the study of controlling magnetism with laser, now enters a new stage. For such controls, Floquet engineering is a key concept, which means the method of controlling static properties of targets with high-frequency external fields like laser. I review the theoretical foundation of Floquet engineering and its application to magnetic insulators. Basic magnetic quantities such as magnetization, spin chirality, and spin current are shown to be controlled with intense THz laser or wave.

Abstract: The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.

Abstract: Recently, the simulation of moir\'e physics using cold atom platforms has gained significant attention. These platforms provide an opportunity to explore novel aspects of moir\'e physics that go beyond the limits of traditional condensed matter systems. Building on recent experimental advancements in creating twisted bilayer spin-dependent optical lattices for pseudospin-1/2 Bose gases, we extend this concept to a trilayer optical lattice for spin-1 Bose gases. Unlike conventional moir\'e patterns, which are typically induced by interlayer tunneling or interspin coupling, the moir\'e pattern in this trilayer system arises from inter-species atomic interactions. We investigate the ground state of Bose-Einstein condensates loaded in this spin-1 twisted optical lattice under both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. We find that the ground state forms a periodic pattern of distinct phases in the homogeneous case, including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, polar, and broken axial symmetry phases. Additionally, by quenching the optical lattice potential strength, we examine the quench dynamics of the system above the ground state and observe the emergence of topological excitations such as vortex pairs. This study provides a pathway for exploring the rich physics of spin-1 twisted optical lattices and expands our understanding of moir\'e systems in synthetic quantum platforms.

Abstract: The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.

Abstract: Compounds based on Cr have been found to be among the first single-layer magnets. In addition, transition metal dichalcogenides are promising candidates to show long-range ferromagnetic order down to the two-dimensional limit. We use ab initio calculations to provide a description of the various Cr$_x$Se$_{x+1}$ stoichiometries that may occur by analyzing from the bulk materials to the monolayer limit. We study the different structural distortions, including charge density waves that each system can present by analyzing their phonon spectra and dynamic stability. We provide a description of their basic electronic structure and study their magnetic properties, including the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. The evolution of all these properties with the dimensionality of the systems is discussed. This intends to be a comprehensive view of the broad family of Cr selenides.

arXiv:2412.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.

Abstract: The semiconductiong ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon (${\alpha'}$-BNR) due to its incredible properties such as high stability and great mobility of carriers demostrates high-efficiency in thermoelectric devices. These properties enable us to produce the spin current by a temperature gradient with lower energy consumption technology. In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects are studied in a zigzag ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads magnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations are performed for a ${\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the tight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient so that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential spin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of thermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the effect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\alpha'}$-BNR. A significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in the magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that the ${\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g., graphene and silicene. This is attributed to the semiconducting nature and high asymmetry between electrons and holes in the ${\alpha'}$-BNR. The exceptional features of ${\alpha'}$-BNR makes it a very suitable choice for using in thermoelectric devices.

arXiv:2412.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase crystals are a class of non-uniform superconducting ground states characterized by spontaneous phase gradients of the superconducting order parameter. These phase gradients non-locally drive periodic currents and magnetic fields, thus breaking both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translational symmetry. The phase crystal instability is generally triggered by negative and inhomogeneous superfluid stiffness. Several scenarios have been identified that can realize phase crystals, especially flat bands at specific edges of unconventional nodal superconductors. Motivated by omnipresent disorder in all materials, we employ the ${t}$-matrix approach within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity to study the emergence of phase crystals at edges of a nodal $d$-wave superconductor. We quantify the full phase diagram as a function of the impurity scattering energy and the temperature, with full self-consistency in the impurity self energies, the superconducting order parameter, and the vector potential. We find that the phase crystal survives even up to $\sim 40-50\%$ of the superconducting critical impurity strength in both the Born and unitary scattering limits. Finally, we show how mesoscopic finite-size effects induce a competition with a state still breaking time-reversal symmetry but with translationally invariant edge currents.

arXiv:2412.14912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.

Abstract: The enhancement of Neel temperature ($T_N$) of low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnets in antiferromagnetic bilayers AF1/AF2, where the $T_N$ of AF1 is larger than AF2 (for example enhancement of $T_{N}$ of CoO in CoO/NiO or FeO in FeO/CoO), is a subject of considerable interest. One essential question needs to be answered in these bilayers: is the interfacial coupling a short-range one or long-range that mediates the effect of the AF1 layers on the magnetic properties of AF2 layer? To understand the systematics of the magnetic coupling across the interface, we investigate the plane-resolved magnetotransport properties of antiferromagnetic bilayers using an electron-hole symmetric one-band Hubbard model at half-filling, employing a semi-classical Monte Carlo method. In our model Hamiltonian calculations, we set Coulomb repulsion $U_{1} = 8$ to mimic high-$T_{N}$ AF1 layer, whereas we use $U_{2}$ = $2\times U_{1}$ to mimic the low-$T_{N}$ AF2 layer. Our calculations show that the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet enhances substantially when it's thickness is small, similar to experiments, giving rise to single magnetic transition temperature of the bilayer system. These findings are well supported by a single peak in temperature-dependent specific heat. However, for larger thicknesses, the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet approaches towards its bulk value and constituent antiferromagnetic layers align antiferromagnetically at two separate temperatures and two maxima are observed in specific heat data. Our calculations also show that the delocalization of moments is more or less confined near the interface indicating the short-ranged nature of the proximity effect. Our obtained results are consistent with the experimental observations. A detailed discussion of the modifications that will occur if we use $U_{1} = 8$ and $U_{2}$ = $0.5\times U_{1}$ will also be addressed.

Abstract: Impurities can strongly influence dislocation behavior and thus impact plasticity. Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\alpha$-Fe from ab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and segregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.

Abstract: The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.

Abstract: Nanoconfined water plays an indispensable role in various phenomena in biology, chemistry, and engineering. It exhibits many abnormal properties compared to bulk water, especially under strong confinement. However, the origin of those anomalies is still elusive due to the lack of structural information on hydrogen-bonding networks. Considering the inhomogeneity of the nanocavity and the tiny amount of water molecules, conventional optical spectroscopies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fail to realize the structure analysis of nanoconfined water. Here, we addressed this issue by combining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with advanced quantum sensing(QS) based on an atomic-size quantum sensor like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which can apply the nanoscale-NMR for characterizing both the dynamics and structure of confined water at ambient conditions. We built a two-dimensional (2D) nanoconfined water system with a hexagonal-boron nitride (hBN) flake and a hydrophilic diamond surface. By using the SPM tip to measure the confinement size precisely, we observed a critical confinement size of ~2 nm, below which the water diffusion was significantly suppressed and the hydrogen-bonding network of water showed an ordered structure. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a solid-like water contact layer on the diamond surface under strong confinement, which also reproduced the measured nanoscale-NMR spectra and confirmed the liquid-solid phase transition observed in the experiments. Notably, with this new SPM-QS platform, our results showed a promising way to elucidate the abnormal properties of nanoconfined water in future applications.

Abstract: In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schl\"uter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.

Abstract: In this work, we employed the Ising model to identify phase transitions in a magnetic system where the degree distribution of the network follows a power-law and the connections are assortatively mixed. In the Ising model, the spins assume only two values, $\sigma = \pm 1$, and interact through ferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable parameters: $\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum degree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the assortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of degree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$, $k_m=10$, and $\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of edges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system, and the critical exponents related to magnetization $\beta$, magnetic susceptibility $\gamma$, and the correlation length $\nu$.

Abstract: The experimental demonstration of electric skyrmion bubbles and the recent prediction of their Brownian motion have brought topological ferroelectrics close to their magnetic counterparts. Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.

Abstract: We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as "model selection" tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase, we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.

# Anomalous currents and spontaneous vortices in spin-orbit coupled superconductors

Abstract: We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero \textit{net} transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Surprisingly, the vortices form \textit{nonlocally}; they are situated in between the inclusions. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the "magnetic memory effect" observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.

Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.

Abstract: Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.

Abstract: A few years ago, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) has been found in Anderson and Kondo 2-channel spin-1 impurity models that include a hard-axis anisotropy term $DS_z^2$ with $D > 0$. The most remarkable manifestation of the TQPT is a jump in the spectral density of localized electrons, at the Fermi level, from very high to very low values as $D$ is increased. If the two conduction channels are equivalent, the transition takes place at the critical anisotropy $D_c \sim 2.5\; T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature for $D=0$. This jump might be important to develop a molecular transistor. The jump is due to a corresponding one in the Luttinger integral, which has a topological non-trivial value $\pi/2$ for $D > D_c$. Here, we review the main results for the spectral density and highlight the significance of the theory for the interpretation of measurements conducted on magnetic atoms or molecules on metallic surfaces. In these experiments, where $D$ is held constant, the energy scale $T_K$ is manipulated by some parameters. The resulting variation gives rise to a differential conductance $dI/dV$, measured by scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, which is consistent with a TQPT at an intermediate value of $T_K$. We also show that the theory can be extended to integer spin $S>1$ and two-impurity systems. This is also probably true for half-integer spin and non-equivalent channels in some cases.

Abstract: Twisted van der Waals bilayers offer ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms for exploring the intricate interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons. By investigating twisted MoS2 bilayer, featuring two distinct stackings but with identical commensurate supercell sizes, we reveal an unusual dielectric response behavior inherent to this system. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the application of an out-of-plane electric field gives different responses in electronic polarization. Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that this dielectric response comes from the planar charge redistribution associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The underlying mechanism lies in the fact that the external electric field tends to modify the internal pseudo-spin texture \sigma, subsequently generating an out-of-plane (pseudo-) spin current j_s \propto \sigma \times B_R as response to an in-plane pseudomagnetic field B_R through Rashba SOC. It is found that the generated j_s is opposite for the two distinct stackings, resulting in opposite in-plane electric susceptibility. As a consequence, through magnetoelectric coupling within such nonmagnetic system, there give rise to opposite tendency to redistribute charge, ultimately leading to an amplified or suppressed dielectric response.

Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.

Abstract: Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} < 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $|\theta_\mathrm{DL}| \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.

Abstract: Nanobubbles wield significant influence over the electronic properties of 2D materials, showing diverse applications ranging from flexible devices to strain sensors. Here, we reveal that a strongly-correlated phenomenon, i.e., Kondo resonance, naturally takes place as an intrinsic property of graphene nanobubbles. The localized strain within the nanobubbles engenders pseudo magnetic fields, driving pseudo Landau levels with degenerate Landau orbits. Under the Coulomb repulsion, the Landau orbits form an effective $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pseudospin coupled to the bath via exchange interaction. This results in a new flavor screening mechanism that drives an exotic flavor-frozen Kondo effect, which is absent in conventional Kondo systems. The resonance here also exhibits an unparalleled tunability via strain engineering, establishing a versatile new platform to simulate novel correlated phenomena based on pseudo Landau levels.

Abstract: We analyze the temperature evolution of the anomalous magnetic spectrum of the spin-1/2 triangular quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is proximate to a quantum phase transition leading to a spin liquid phase. Recently, its low energy excitations have been identified with two-spinon bound states, well defined in an ample region of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we compute the thermal magnetic spectrum within a Schwinger boson approach, incorporating Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle-point approximation. In order to account for a finite N\'eel temperature $T_N$, we incorporate an exchange interaction between triangular layers. As temperature rises, the dispersion relation of the two-spinon bound states, representing single-magnon excitations, remains unchanged but becomes mixed with the thermally activated spinon continuum. Consequently, a crossover occurs at a temperature $T^* \simeq 0.75 T_N$, defining a {\it terminated Goldstone regime} between $T^*$ and $T_N$, where only the magnons close to the Goldstone modes survive as well-defined excitations, up to the N\'eel temperature. Our results support the idea that the fractionalization of magnons near a transition to a disordered phase can be extended to more realistic quasi-2D frustrated antiferromagnets.

Abstract: We show that spontaneous density segregation in dense systems of aligning circle swimmers is a condensation phenomenon at odds with the phase separation scenarios usually observed in two-dimensional active matter. The condensates, which take the form of vortices or rotating polar packets, can absorb a finite fraction of the particles in the system, and keep a finite or slowly growing size as their mass increases. Our results are obtained both at particle and continuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and both identical and disordered chiralities. Condensation implies synchronization, even though our systems are in 2D and bear strictly local interactions. We propose a phenomenological theory based on observed mechanisms that accounts qualitatively for our results.

Abstract: We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.

Abstract: The Hall effect is one of the most fundamental but elusive phenomena in condensed matter physics due to the rich variety of underlying mechanisms. Here we report an exceptionally large Hall effect in a frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$ with high conductivity. The Hall conductivity at the base temperature is as high as 4 x 10$^4$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ and shows abrupt sign changes under magnetic fields. Remarkably, the giant Hall effect is rapidly suppressed as the longitudinal conductivity is lowered upon increasing temperature or introducing tiny amount of quenched disorder. Our systematic transport measurements together with neutron scattering measurements and ab initio band calculations indicate that the unusual Hall effect can be understood in terms of spin-splitting induced emergence/disappearance of Fermi pockets as well as skew scattering from spin-chiral cluster fluctuations in a field-polarized state. The present study demonstrates complex interplay among magnetization, spin-dependent electronic structure, and spin fluctuations in producing the giant Hall effect in highly conductive frustrated magnets.

Abstract: The electronic excitation spectrum of a material characterises the response to external electromagnetic perturbations through its energy loss function (ELF), which is obtained from several experimental sources that usually do not completely agree among them. In this work, we assess the available ELF of three metals, namely chromium, palladium, and samarium, by using the dielectric formalism to calculate relevant stopping quantities, such as the stopping cross sections for protons and alpha particles, as well as the corresponding electron inelastic mean free paths. The comparison of these quantities (as calculated from different sets of ELF) with the available experimental data for each of the analyzed metals highlights the promising capability of the recently proposed reverse Monte Carlo method for the determination of the ELF. This work also analyzes the contribution of different electronic shells to the electronic excitation spectra of these materials, and reveals the important role that the excitation of "semi-core" bands plays on the energy loss mechanism for these metals.

Abstract: A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.

Abstract: ThMn12-type (Sm,Zr)1(Fe,Co,Ti)12 compounds show great potential for permanent magnets. Magnetically hard anisotropic powders prepared via reduction-diffusion exhibit a significant increase in coercivity from 0.45 T to 1.26 T as the processing temperature is raised from 990{\deg}C to 1220{\deg}C. Structural and microchemical analyses at high-resolution reveal that high-temperature processing annihilates grain boundaries (GBs) and reduces the density of twin boundaries (TBs), which are defects acting as weak links limiting the coercivity in the 1:12 system. Ostwald ripening is proposed as the mechanism behind the reduction of GB and TB densities at higher temperature, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy and enhancing atomic structural uniformity.

Abstract: Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s < \Phi < (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.

Abstract: We apply the method of moments to the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and derive the equations of motion for the irreducible moments of arbitrary tensor-rank of the invariant single-particle distribution function. We study two cases, in the first of which the moments are taken to be irreducible with respect to the little group associated with the time-like fluid four-velocity, while in the second case they are assumed to be also irreducible with respect to a space-like four-vector orthogonal to the fluid four-velocity, which breaks the spatial isotropy to a rotational symmetry in the plane transverse to this vector. A systematic truncation and closure of the general moment equations leads, in the first case, to a theory of relativistic higher-order dissipative resistive magnetohydrodynamics. In the second case, we obtain a novel theory of dissipative resistive anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics, where the momentum anisotropy is in principle independent from that introduced by the external magnetic field.

Abstract: The theory of plasmas, that is collectives of charged particles, is developed using the coordinate-free and geometric methods of exterior calculus. This dramatically simplifies the algebra and gives a geometric physical interpretation. The fundamental foundation on which the theory is built is the conservation of phase space volume expressed by the Generalized Liouville Equation in terms of the Lie derivative. The theory is expanded both in the order of the correlation and in the weakness of the correlation. This gives a Generalized BBGKY (Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon) Hierarchy. The derivation continues to give a new generalized formula for the Variational Theory of Reaction Rates (VTRR). Pullbacks of the generalized formulas to generic canonical coordinates and Poisson brackets are done. Where appropriate, the canonical coordinates are assumed to be "action-angle" coordinates that are generated by the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the action. Finally, generalized forms of all the common kinetic equations are derived: the Vlasov Equation, the Boltzmann Equation, the Master Equation, the Fokker-Planck Equation, the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) Equation, the Fluid Equations, and the MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) Equations. Specific examples are given of these equations. The application of the VTRR to three-body recombination in a strong magnetic field is shown.

Abstract: This work shows an anomalously enhanced response of the low-latitude ionosphere over the Indian sector under weak geomagnetic conditions (October 31, 2021) in comparison to a stronger event (November 04, 2021) under the influence of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME)-driven Magnetic Cloud (MC)-like and sheath regions respectively. The investigation is based on measurements of the Total Electron Content (TEC) from Ahmedabad (23.06$^\circ$N, 72.54$^\circ$E, geographic; dip angle: 35.20$^\circ$), a location near the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) over the Indian region. During the weaker event, the observed TEC from the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites of Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), showed diurnal maximum enhancements of about 20 TECU over quiet-time variations, as compared to the stronger event where no such enhancements are present. It is shown that storm intensity (SYM-H) or magnitude of the southward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) alone is unable to determine the ionospheric impacts of this space weather event. However, it is the non-fluctuating southward IMF and the corresponding penetration electric fields, for a sufficient interval of time, in tandem with the poleward neutral wind variations, that determines the strengthening of low-latitude electrodynamics of this anomalous event of October 31, 2021. Therefore, the present investigation highlights a case for further investigations of the important roles played by non-fluctuating penetration electric fields in determining a higher response of the low-latitude ionosphere even if the geomagnetic storm intensities are significantly low.

Abstract: Piecewise omnigenous fields are stellarator magnetic fields that are optimized with respect to radial neoclassical transport thanks to a second adiabatic invariant that is piecewisely constant on the flux-surface. They are qualitatively different from omnigenous fields (including quasi-isodynamic or quasisymmetric fields), for which the second adiabatic invariant is a flux-surface constant. Piecewise omnigenous fields thus open an alternative path towards stellarator reactors. In this work, piecewise omnigenous fields are characterized and parametrized in a systematic manner. This is a step towards including piecewise omnigenity as an explicit design criterion in stellarator optimization, and towards a systematic study of the properties of nearly piecewise omnigenous stellarator configurations.

Abstract: In this paper we present a new thin-wall eddy current modeling code, ThinCurr, for studying inductively-coupled currents in 3D conducting structures -- with primary application focused on the interaction between currents flowing in coils, plasma, and conducting structures of magnetically-confined plasma devices. The code utilizes a boundary finite element method on an unstructured, triangular grid to accurately capture device structures. The new code, part of the broader Open FUSION Toolkit, is open-source and designed for ease of use without sacrificing capability and speed through a combination of Python, Fortran, and C/C++ components. Scalability to large models is enabled through use of hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank compression of the inductance matrix, which is otherwise dense. Ease of handling large models of complicated geometry is further supported by automatic determination of supplemental elements through a greedy homology approach. A detailed description of the numerical methods of the code and verification of the implementation of those methods using cross-code comparisons against the VALEN code and Ansys commercial analysis software is shown.

Abstract: We employ a multiscale computational approach to investigate the condensation process of the C-terminal low-complexity region of the Caprin1 protein as a function of increasing ATP concentration for three states: the initial mixed state, nanocondensate formation, and the dissolution of the droplet as it reenters the mixed state. We show that upon condensation ATP assembles via pi-pi interactions, resulting in the formation of a large cluster of stacked ATP molecules stabilized by sodium counterions. The surface of the ATP assembly interacts with the arginine-rich regions of the Caprin1 protein, particularly with its N-terminus, to promote the complete phase-separated droplet on a lengthscale of tens of nanometers. In order to understand droplet stability, we analyze the near-surface electrostatic potential (NS-ESP) of Caprin1 and estimate the zeta potential of the Caprin1-ATP assemblies. We predict a positive NS-ESP at the Caprin1 surface for low ATP concentrations that defines the early mixed state, in excellent agreement with the NS-ESP obtained from NMR experiments using paramagnetic resonance enhancement. By contrast, the NS-ESP of Caprin1 at the surface of the nanocondensate at moderate levels of ATP is highly negative compared to the mixed state, and estimates of a large zeta potential outside the highly dense region of charge further explains the remarkable stability of this phase separated droplet assembly. As ATP concentrations rise further, the strong electrostatic forces needed for nanocondensate stability are replaced by weaker Caprin1-ATP interactions that drive the reentry into the mixed state that exhibits a much lower zeta potential.

Abstract: Pellets of frozen material travelling into a magnetically confined fusion plasma are accelerated by the so-called pellet rocket effect. The non-uniform plasma heats the pellet ablation cloud asymmetrically, producing pressure-driven, rocket-like propulsion of the pellet. We present a semi-analytical model of this process by perturbing a spherically symmetric ablation model. Predicted pellet accelerations match experimental estimates in current tokamaks ($\sim 10^5 \;\rm m/s^2$). Projections for ITER high-confinement scenarios ($\sim 10^6 \;\rm m/s^2$) indicate significantly shorter pellet penetration than expected without this effect, which could limit the effectiveness of disruption mitigation.

Abstract: A universal numerical method is developed for the investigation of magnetic neutron scattering. By applying the pseudospectral-time-domain (PSTD) algorithm to the spinor version of the Schr\"odinger equation, the evolution of the spin-state of the scattered wave can be solved in full space and time. This extra spin degree of freedom brings some unique new features absent in the numerical theory on the scalar wave scatterings [1]. Different numerical stability condition has to be re-derived due to the coupling between the different spin states. As the simplest application, the neutron scattering by the magnetic field of a uniformly magnetized sphere is studied. The PSTD predictions are compared with those from the Born-approximation. This work not only provides a systematic tool for analyzing spin-matter interactions, but also builds the forward model for testing novel neutron imaging methodologies, such as the newly developed thermal neutron Fourier-transform ghost imaging.

Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.

Abstract: Dynamic resistance occurs in a superconducting tape carrying a dc transport current while being exposed to an alternating magnetic field. This effect is caused by flux movements interacting with the transport current. The dynamic resistance is already applied in many superconducting applications, for example superconducting flux pumps or persistent current switches. The resistance is highly dependent on the magnetic field and the frequency the superconductor is subjected to and its properties. When the dynamic resistance exceeds a certain value and thus enters the magnitude of the resistances of the normal conducting layers of the HTS tape, these normal conducting layers play a significant role in the total resistance of the tape. In this paper, modifications were made to the silver stabilizer and the total resistance of the HTS tape has been investigated. The experimental results with frequencies up to 1000 Hz and magnetic field up to 277 mT show significant increases in resistance. Additionally, a multilayer model based on H-formulation is presented to calculate the losses of the superconductor. The results also show significant heating due to the losses and therefore a temperature rise, which effects the measured total resistance. These results can be further used for applications where high switchable resistances are required with zero dc resistance when the magnet is turned off.

Abstract: In 2017, as the solar cycle approached solar minimum, an unusually long and large depression was observed in galactic cosmic ray (GCR) protons, detected with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02), lasting for the second half of that year. The depression, as seen in the Bartel rotation-averaged proton flux, has the form of a Forbush decrease (FD). Despite this resemblance, however, the cause of the observed depression does not have such a simple explanation as FDs, due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), typically last for a few days at 1 AU rather than half a year. In this work, we seek the cause of the observed depression and investigate two main possibilities. First, we consider a mini-cycle - a temporary change in the solar dynamo that changes the behavior of the global solar magnetic field and, by this, the modulation of GCRs. Secondly, we investigate the behavior of solar activity, both CMEs and co-rotating/stream interactions regions (C/SIRs), during this period. Our findings show that, although there is some evidence for mini-cycle behavior prior to the depression, the depression is ultimately due to a combination of recurrent CMEs, SIRs and CIRs. A particular characteristic of the depression is that the largest impacts that help to create and maintain it are due to four CMEs from the same, highly active, magnetic source that persists for several solar rotations. This active magnetic source is unusual given the closeness of the solar cycle to solar minimum, which also helps to make the depression more evident.

arXiv:2412.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.

This setup is used to characterize the behaviour of a NbN coated superconducting cavity in a 2.5T strong magnetic field, at a resonance frequency of 8.4GHz. We observe an increasing surface resistance with increasing magnetic field, leading to a decreasing quality factor. The behaviour is similar to that of previously studied cavities using Nb3Tn.

arXiv:2412.15051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new constraints and sensitivities to heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) with transition magnetic moments, also known as dipole-portal HNLs. This is accomplished using data from the T2K ND280 near detector in addition to the projected three-year dataset of the upgraded ND280 detector. Dipole-portal HNLs have been extensively studied in the literature and offer a potential explanation for the $4.8\sigma$ MiniBooNE anomaly. To perform our analysis, we simulate HNL decays to $e^+e^-$ pairs in the gaseous time projection chambers of the ND280 detector and its upgrade. Recasting an ND280 search for mass-mixed HNLs, we find that ND280 data places world-leading constraints on dipole-portal HNLs in the 390-743\,{\rm MeV} mass range, disfavoring the region of parameter space favored by the MiniBooNE anomaly. The addition of three years of ND280 upgrade data will be able to disfavor the MiniBooNE solution at the $5 \sigma$ confidence level and extend the world-leading constraints to dipole-portal HNLs in the 148-860\,{\rm MeV} mass range. Our analysis suggests that ND280 data excludes dipole-portal HNLs as a solution to the MiniBooNE excess, motivating a dedicated search within the T2K collaboration and potentially highlighting the need for alternative explanations for the MiniBooNE anomaly.

Abstract: We investigate a model of turbulent magnetic reconnection introduced by Higashimori, Yokoi and Hoshino (Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 255001) and show that the classic two-dimensional, steady-state Sweet-Parker and Petschek reconnection solutions are supported. We present evidence that these are the only two steady-state reconnection solutions, and we determine the criterion for their selection. Sweet-Parker reconnection occurs when there is no growth in turbulent energy, whereas Petschek reconnection occurs when the current density in the reconnecting current sheet is able to surpass a critical value, allowing for the growth of turbulent energy that creates the diffusion region. Further, we show that the Petschek solutions are self-similar, depending on the value of the turbulent time scale, and produce a universal steady reconnection rate. The self-consistent development of Petschek reconnection through turbulence, within the model, is an example of fast and steady magnetic reconnection without an explicit need for the collisionless terms in an extended Ohm's law.

Originating from nonlocal electromagnetic response due to vertical electron confinement in the system, such singularities lead to lateral (angular) Goos-H\"anchen shifts on the millimeter (milliradian) scale in the visible range, greatly exceeding those reported previously for artificially designed metasurfaces, offering new opportunities for quantum material development.

Abstract: In this short communication, we qualitatively analyze possible effects of the 10 October 2024 geomagnetic storm on accelerating the reentry of a Starlink satellite from very low-Earth orbit (VLEO). The storm took place near the maximum of solar cycle (SC) 25, which has shown to be more intense than SC24. Based on preliminary geomagnetic indices, the 10 October 2024, along with the 10 May 2024, were the most intense events since the well-known Halloween storms of October/November 2003. By looking at a preliminary version of the Dst index and altitudes along with velocities extracted from two-line element (TLE) data of the Starlink-1089 (SL-1089) satellite, we observe a possible connection between storm main phase onset and a sharp decay of SL-1089. The satellite was predicted to reenter on 22 October, but it reentered on 12 October, 10 days before schedule. The sharp altitude decay of SL-1089 revealed by TLE data coincides with the storm main phase onset. We compare the de-orbiting altitudes of another three satellites during different geomagnetic conditions and observe that the day difference between actual and predicted reentries increases for periods with higher geomagnetic activity. Therefore, we call for future research to establish the eventual causal relationship between storm occurrence and satellite orbital decay. As predicted by previous works, SC25 is already producing extreme geomagnetic storms with unprecedented satellite orbital drag effects and consequences for current megaconstellations in VLEO.

Abstract: We present a design and performance tests of an intense source of cold hydrogen atoms for loading large magnetic traps. Our source is based on a cryogenic dissociator of molecular hydrogen at 0.6 K followed by a series of thermal accommodators at 0.5, 0.2 and 0.13 K with inner surfaces covered by a superfluid helium film. All components are thermally anchored to corresponding stages of a dilution refrigerator. The source provides a continuous flux of 7$\cdot$$10^{13}$ H atoms/s in a temperature range of 130-200 mK. We have successfully used the source for loading a large Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap recently built in our laboratory [arXiv:2108.09123 or Rev. Sci. Instr. 93 (2), 023201 (2022)]. Calorimetric measurements of the atomic recombination heat allow reliable determination of the atomic flux and H gas density in the trap. We have tested the performance of the source and loading of H atoms into the trap at various configurations of the trapping field, reducing the magnetic barrier height to 75% and 50% of the nominal value of 0.8 T (0.54 K) as well as at the open configuration of the trap at its lower end, when the atoms are in contact with the trapping cell walls covered by a superfluid helium film. In the latter case, raising the trapping cell temperature to 200-250 mK, the low-field seeking atoms at densities exceeding 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ can be stored for the time over 1000 s, sufficiently long for experiments on precision spectroscopy of cold H gas.

Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.

Abstract: This work aims at acquiring a more complete understanding of how lateral heterogeneities of the CMB heat flux affect the geodynamo while other relevant parameters are pushed towards realistic values. For this purpose, we ran geodynamo simulations with degree 1 and 2 spherical harmonic patterns of heat flux at the CMB. Several geodynamo models are used, ranging from standard numerical dynamos to more extreme parameters, including strong field cases and turbulent cases. We show that heat flux heterogeneities with amplitudes compatible with our knowledge of mantle convection history can favour multipolar dynamos. The multipolar transition is associated with a disruption of westward flows either through eastward thermal winds or through a loss of equatorial symmetry. Strong field dynamo models are found to have larger westward flows and are less sensitive to heat flux heterogeneities. Furthermore, we find that the dipolar fraction of the magnetic field correlates with $M_{Za}^*=\dfrac{\Lambda_{Za}}{Rm_{Za}^2}$ where $\Lambda_{Za}$ is the zonal antisymmetric Elsasser number and $Rm_{Za}$ is the zonal antisymmetric magnetic Reynolds number. Importantly, $M_{Za}^*$ estimated for the Earth's core is consistent with a reversing dipolar magnetic field. Within the range of $M_{Za}^*$ susceptible to reversals, breaking the equatorial symmetry or forcing eastward zonal flows through an equatorial cooling of the core consistently triggers reversals or a transition towards multipolar dynamos in our simulations. Our results support that time variations of heat-flux heterogeneities driven by mantle convection through Earth's history are capable of inducing the significant variations in the reversal frequency observed in the palaeomagnetic record.

Abstract: We investigated a plasma system with kinematic viscosity ($\nu = 0.006$) and magnetic diffusivity ($\eta = 0.006$), driven by helical kinetic energy, to study the dynamics of energy and helicity in magnetic diffusion. Using the numerical data obtained, we explored methods to determine the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients that linearize the nonlinear electromotive force (EMF) and the dynamo process. Initially, we applied conventional statistical approaches such as mean-field theory (MFT), direct interaction approximation (DIA), and eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian (EDQNM) closure. We then proposed a simpler alternative method using large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data to calculate $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Our findings show that while $\alpha$ qualitatively aligns with theoretical predictions, $\beta$ remains negative, indicating an inverse cascade of energy through magnetic diffusion. This deviated from conventional models and was further analyzed using a recursive method in the second moment identity, revealing that small-scale kinetic helicity couples with large-scale current density to transport energy inversely. We validated our method by reproducing the numerically calculated data. The consistency between our method and direct numerical simulations (DNS) suggests that the negative diffusion process in plasma has a physical basis.

Abstract: A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.

# Arriving at Short Wavelength Infrared: Beyond 1000 nm Reversible Photoswitching of peri-Anthracenethioindigo Using Aggregation Induced Bathochromism

## 到达短波长红外: 超过1000 nm的可逆光开关使用聚集诱导的红色素

**Authors:** Maria Eugenia , Perez-Ojeda Rodriguez

The development of modern molecular photoswitches has made tremendous progress with the advent of low-energy responsive variants able to use visible and red light for reversible photoresponses. Dedicated approaches have been developed to achieve such highly desired properties including push-pull substitution, new chromophore designs, and physical means such as two-photon absorptions, sensitization, or upconversion. However, reaching further into the near infrared (NIR) has proven to be extremely challenging so far, raising the question whether viable photoswitching can actually go beyond 1000 nm. Here we use the concept of aggregation induced bathochromism (AIB) to enable direct excitation beyond 1000 nm for reversible photoswitching. Derivatives of the recently reported peri-anthracenethioindigo (PAT) can be aggregated into ca. 500 nm large particles, which shifts their absorption far beyond 1000 nm and into the short wavelength infrared (SWIR) region. Upon irradiation with 1020 nm light, the metastable Z isomer is obtained while at the same time the aggregates are dissolved. Photoisomerization of the Z isomer with orange or red light allows to return to the aggregated state establishing reversible beyond 1000 nm photoswitching. Further, a secondary and independent level of control is enabled via pH-dependent aggregation and deaggregation and corresponding absorption shifting. The resulting multi-stimuli responsiveness was applied in advanced molecular logic operations in the red and NIR absorption regime. AIB thus offers a highly promising way to realize extremely low-energy responsive photoswitching while at the same time allowing to control aggregation and dissolution behavior at the SWIR end of the electromagnetic spectrum.

# Preparation of novel CO 2 copolymer diol and its application on waterborne polyurethane

## 新型CO 2共聚二醇的制备及其在水性聚氨酯中的应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5525654/latest

CO2 copolymer diol (PPCD) with superior transparency is an indispensable raw material for the polyurethane polymers, especially for water-based polyurethane coatings. However, commercial PPCD is generally opaque. In this work, A novel sustainable, colorless and transparent PPCD was prepared by using carbon dioxide (CO2) and propylene oxide (PO) as raw materials. Its basic structure was tested and verified by Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. Appropriate increase CO2 content did not obviously reduce the transparency and thermal stability of PPCD and the optimum value was 29.1 wt.%. Furthermore, the waterborne polyurethane (WPU) was successfully synthesized by prepolymer method with poly(1,4-butylene adipate) (PBA), polypropylene glycol (PPG) or prepared PPCD as the soft segment, respectively. With the increase of CO2 content, the thermodynamic property of WPU was significantly improved. When CO2 content increased from 23.50 wt.% to 31.50 wt.%, the tensile strength increased from 23.27 MPa to 64.63 MPa and the elongation at break decreased from 750.85&amp;ndash;520.37%, accompanied by the glass-transition temperature increased from &amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;49.7 ℃ to -34.5 ℃. In addition, the WPU prepared by PPCD was also found to have better tensile strength, transparency and storage stability than that prepared by PBA and PPG. A new inspiration was provided to develop high-transparent CO2 based water-based polyurethane coatings.
