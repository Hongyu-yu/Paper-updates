# Current generated by the quantum Hall effect found to have additional magnetic properties

## 由量子霍尔效应产生的电流被发现具有额外的磁性

Link: https://phys.org/news/2024-12-current-generated-quantum-hall-effect.html

The quantum Hall effect, a fundamental effect in quantum mechanics, not only generates an electric but also a magnetic current. It arises from the motion of electrons on an orbit around the nuclei of atoms. This has been demonstrated by the calculations of a team from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU), which are now published in the journal Physical Review Letters. These results can potentially be used to develop new types of inexpensive and energy-efficient devices.

arXiv:2412.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite difference based micromagnetic simulations are a powerful tool for the computational investigation of magnetic structures. In this paper, we demonstrate how the discretization of continuous micromagnetic equations introduces a numerical 'discretization anisotropy'. We demonstrate that, in certain scenarios, this anisotropy operates on an energy scale comparable to that of intrinsic physical phenomena. Furthermore, we illustrate that selecting appropriate finite difference stencils and minimizing the size of the discretization cells are effective strategies to mitigate discretization anisotropy.

# Chiral anomaly and longitudinal magnetoconductance in pseudospin-1 fermions

**Authors:** Azaz Ahmad, Gargee Sharma

arXiv:2412.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral anomaly (CA), a hallmark of Weyl fermions, has emerged as a cornerstone of condensed matter physics following the discovery of Weyl semimetals. While the anomaly in pseudospin-1/2 (Weyl) systems is well-established, its extension to higher-pseudospin fermions remains a frontier with critical implications for transport phenomena in materials with multifold fermions. We present a rigorous quasiclassical analysis of CA and longitudinal magnetotransport in pseudospin-1 fermions, advancing beyond conventional models that assume constant relaxation times and neglect the orbital magnetic moment and global charge conservation. Our study uncovers a magnetic-field dependence of the longitudinal magnetoconductance: it is positive and quadratic-in-B for weak internode scattering and transitions to negative values beyond a critical internode scattering strength. Notably, the critical threshold is lower for pseudospin-1 fermions compared to their pseudospin-1/2 counterparts. We show analytically that the zero-field conductivity is affected more strongly by internode scattering for pseudospin-1 fermions than conventional Weyl fermions. These insights provide a foundational framework for interpreting recent experiments on multifold fermions and offer a roadmap for probing CA in candidate materials with space group symmetries 199, 214, and 220.

arXiv:2412.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a direct connection between static structure factors and quantum ground states for two-spin interaction Hamiltonians was proven. This suggests the possibility of quantum state tomography from neutron scattering. Here, we investigate the associated fitness landscape numerically. We find a linear relationship between the mean square distances of the structure factors and the associated state overlaps, implying a well-behaved fitness landscape. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that the approach can be generalized to thermal equilibrium states. We also extend the arguments to the cases of applied magnetic fields and finite clusters.

Abstract: Bismuth Telluride (Bi$_2$Te$_3$) is a widely studied topological insulator, recognized for its unique surface states, low electronic bandgap, and low thermal conductivity. In this study, we characterize exfoliated Bi$_2$Te$_3$ dispersions produced via solvothermal intercalation, where ferromagnetism was measured at room temperature. DFT simulations show that this ferromagnetic behavior is attributed to the presence of vacancies and antisites in both the bulk material and the exfoliated crystals. Additionally, the DFT results were complemented by experimental measurements of the optical bandgap using UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealing a broadening of the bandgap as the material becomes thinner.

# Localized fermions on the triangular lattice with Ising-like interactions

**Authors:** Lubom\'ira Regeciov\'a (Institute of Experimental Physics Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ko\v{s}ice, Slovakia), Konrad Jerzy Kapcia (Institute of Spintronics,Quantum Information, Faculty of Physics,Astronomy, Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\'n, Poland)

arXiv:2412.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J<0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1<u>|J|<-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J>0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1</u>2<u>|J|<0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U</u>|J|>-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J>0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.

# Emergence of half-metallic ferromagnetism and valley polarization in transition metal substituted WSTe monolayer

arXiv:2412.10819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials hold a great importance in spintronic and valleytronic applications due to their unique lattice structures and emergent properties. They intrinsically exhibit both an in-plane inversion and out-of-plane mirror symmetry breakings, which offer a new degree of freedom to electrons in the material. One of the main limitations in the multifunctional applications of these materials is, however, that, they are usually non-magnetic in nature. Here, using first-principles calculations, we propose to induce magnetic degree of freedom in non-magnetic WSTe via doping with transition metal (TM) elements -- Fe, Mn and Co. Further, we comprehensively probe the electronic, spintronic and valleytronic properties in these systems. Our simulations predict intrinsic Rashba and Zeeman-type spin splitting in pristine WSTe. The obtained Rashba parameter is $\sim$ 422 meV\AA\; along the $\Gamma - K$ direction. Our study shows a strong dependence on uniaxial and biaxial strains where we observe an enhancement of $\sim$ 2.1\% with 3\% biaxial compressive strain. The electronic structure of TM-substituted WSTe reveals half-metallic nature for 6.25 and 18.75\% of Fe, 25\% of Mn, and 18.75 and 25\% of Co structures, which leads to 100\% spin polarization. The obtained values of valley polarization 65, 54.4 and 46.3 meV for 6.25\% of Fe, Mn and Co, respectively, are consistent with the literature data for other Janus materials. Further, our calculations show a strain dependent tunability of valley polarization, where we find an increasing (decreasing) trend with uniaxial and biaxial tensile (compressive) strains. We observed a maximum enhancement of $\sim$ 1.72\% for 6.25\% of Fe on application of 3\% biaxial tensile strain.

Abstract: We study the symmetry of the coupling between surface acoustic waves and ferromagnetic resonance in a thin magnetic film of CoFeB deposited on top of a piezoelectric Z-cut LiNbO3 substrate. We vary the orientation of the applied magnetic field with respect to the wavevector of the surface acoustic wave. Experiments indicate an unexpected 2-fold symmetry of the absorption of the SAW energy by the magnetic film. We discuss whether this symmetry can arise from the magnetoelastic torque of the longitudinal strain and the magnetic susceptibility of ferromagnetic resonance. We find that one origin of the 2-fold symmetry can be the weak in-plane uniaxial anisotropy present within the magnetic film. This phenomena adds to the previously identified other source of 2-fold symmetry but shall persist for ultrathin films when the dipolar interactions cease to contribute to the anisotropy of the slope of the spin wave dispersion relation.

Abstract: Realizing novel topological states in magnonics systems opens new opportunities for developing robust low-power spin-wave-based devices. Introducing non-equilibrium antimagnon can bring additional effects to the topology and chirality. In this report, we revisit the ferromagnetic multilayers with a non-equilibrium state and generalize it to antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic multilayers. We found that non-equilibrium states with the perturbative coupling of magnon and antimagnon can turn an originally trivial state into a non-trivial one, characterized by Chern number. Both coherent coupling and dissipative coupling are found in the band structures and can be controlled by the external magnetic field and torques. Further, in the bilayer unit cell, all four possible chirality combinations are achieved at a few GHz. Our work presents an accessible platform for realizing topological magnonic surface states, paving the way for controlling magnon chirality and facilitating various types of coupling.

Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing interest in understanding the actual magnetic ground state of the promising axion insulator candidate \ch{EuIn2As2}, we present here a spin symmetry analysis and \textit{ab initio} calculations, aiming to identify specific exchange-dominated physics that could offer insights into the current debate. We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the \textit{helical} and \textit{broken helical} phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the \textit{broken helical} phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our \textit{ab initio} calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.

arXiv:2412.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection between nonsymmorphic symmetry and electronic correlations has emerged as a platform for topological Kondo semimetallic states and unconventional spin textures. Here we report the synthesis of nonsymmorphic UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ single crystals and their structural, electronic, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties. UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ orders antiferromagnetically (AFM) below $T_N\simeq$ 161 K as evidenced by a sharp cusp in magnetic susceptibility, a second-order phase transition in specific heat, and an upturn in electrical resistivity, which suggests an incommensurate AFM structure that deviates from the A-type magnetism typically observed in this class of materials. Across $T_N$, Hall effect measurements reveal a change from electron-dominated to hole-dominated transport, which points to a sharp reconstruction in the electronic structure at $T_N$. Upon further cooling, a first-order transition is observed at $T_1 \simeq 30 $K in magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity but not in electrical resistivity or Hall measurements, which indicates a small change in the AFM structure that does not affect the electronic structure. Our specific heat data reveal a small Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma \simeq$13 mJmol$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$), consistent with localized 5$f$ electrons. Our results indicate that UPd$_{0.65}$Bi$_2$ hosts weak electronic correlations and is likely away from a Kondo semimetallic state. Low-temperature magnetization measurements show that the AFM structure is remarkably stable to 160 kOe and does not undergo any field-induced transitions. Neutron diffraction and magnetization experiments at higher fields would be valuable to probe the presence of unconventional spin textures.

Abstract: We study the ultralow-temperature thermodynamics and thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of the single-crystal rare-earth chalcogenides NaYbS$_2$ and NaYbSe$_2$, which have an ideal triangular lattice of the Yb$^{3+}$ ions and have been proposed to be quantum spin liquid candidates. The magnetic specific heat divided by temperature $C_{\rm{mag}}/T$ is nearly constant at $T <$ 200 mK, which is indeed the indication of the gapless magnetic excitations with a constant density of states. However, we observe a vanishingly small residual term $\kappa_0/T$, which points to the absence of mobile fermionic excitations in these materials. Both the weak temperature dependence of $\kappa$ and the strong magnetic-field dependence of $\kappa$ suggest the significant scattering between the spinons and phonons, which actually supports the existence of gapless or tiny-gapped quantum spin liquid. Moreover, the $\kappa(B)/\kappa(0)$ isotherms show a series of field-induced magnetic transitions for $B \parallel a$, confirming the easy-plane anisotropy, which is consistent with the results of ac magnetic susceptibility. We expect our results to inspire further interests in the understanding of the spinon-phonon coupling in the spin liquid systems.

Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism within a single material system represents a long-standing goal in condensed matter physics. Van der Waals-based moir\'e superlattices provide an exceptional platform for exploring competing and coexisting broken symmetry states. Alternating twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) exhibits robust superconductivity at the magic angle of 1.57{\deg} and 1.3{\deg}, with suppression at intermediate twist angles. In this study, we investigate the intermediate regime and uncover evidence of orbital magnetism. As previously reported, superconductivity is suppressed near the charge neutrality point (CNP) and emerges at larger moir\'e fillings. Conversely, we find orbital magnetism most substantial near the CNP, diminishing as superconductivity develops. This complementary behavior is similarly observed in the displacement field phase space, highlighting a competitive interplay between the two phases. Utilizing gate-defined Josephson junctions, we probe orbital magnetism by electrostatically tuning the weak links into the magnetic phase, revealing an asymmetric Fraunhofer interference pattern. The estimated orbital ferromagnetic ordering temperature is approximately half the superconducting critical temperature, coinciding with the onset of Fraunhofer asymmetry. Our findings suggest that the observed orbital magnetism is driven by valley polarization and is distinct from the anomalous Hall effect reported at integer fillings in twisted graphene systems. These results offer insights into the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in moir\'e superlattices.

Abstract: Hybrid magnonics, exploring the coupling between magnons and quantum systems, is an exciting field for developing next-generation information technologies. Achieving a strong and tunable magnon-magnon coupling (MMC) in confined nanomagnets is crucial for the on-chip integration of these hybrid systems and advancing the field. In this work, we numerically investigate the interactions between different magnon modes excited within an elliptical magnonic nano-disc (EMND), demonstrating an anti-crossing effect in the dispersion spectra. A comprehensive theoretical framework was presented that explains this anti-crossing phenomenon as a result of MMC and provide estimates for the strength of the coupling (g). Furthermore, we show that this intermodal coupling can be tuned from a strong coupling regime (g = 300 MHz) to a weak coupling regime by varying the direction of the external magnetic field and the intrinsic properties of the EMND. Our combined numerical and theoretical findings offer new insights into MMC, significantly advancing the field of quantum magnonics and magnon-based quantum information technology.

Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials has propelled advancements in technological devices. The Nernst effect, which generates a transverse electric voltage in the presence of a longitudinal thermal gradient, shows great promise for thermoelectric applications. In this work, we report the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$, a layered self-intercalated vdW material which exhibits an antiferromagnetic ordering at TN ~ 191 K followed by a ferromagnetic-like phase transition at TC ~171 K. We observe a prominent topological Hall effect and topological Nernst effect between TC and TN, which is ascribable to non-coplanar spin textures inducing a real-space Berry phase due to competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we show that Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ exhibits a substantial anomalous Nernst effect, featuring a giant Nernst angle of ~37% near TC and a maximum Nernst thermoelectric coefficient of 0.52 uV/K. These results surpass those of conventional ferromagnets and other two-dimensional vdW materials, highlighting Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ as a promising candidate for advanced thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect.

Abstract: We have explored the relaxation process of the spin glass phase in Bi2Fe3GaO9, a geometrically frustrated magnet with a unique structure consisting of pentagonal building blocks known as the Cairo lattice. Using dc magnetization measurements on single crystals, we estimate the relaxation time across various temperatures and fields. Our results indicate that the relaxation time of Bi2Fe3GaO9 follows the Arrhenius law as a function of temperature but remains relatively constant as the applied magnetic field varies. Further, through a carefully designed protocol, we observe significant rejuvenation and memory effects. Remarkably, the memory effects in Bi2Fe3GaO9 are found to be more similar to those observed in classical spin glasses rather than in spin jamming systems, both in terms of the magnitude of the memory effect and the value of the exponent that describes the relaxation behavior. Our findings suggest that Bi2Fe3GaO9 provides an excellent platform for investigating the time-dependent evolution of underlying magnetism using neutron scattering, paving the way for future research.

arXiv:2412.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a comprehensive investigation into the magnetic properties of the chiral multiferroic material CoTeMoO6. In contrast with the previous claim of canted antiferromagnetic order with ferromagnetic components, our investigation reveals an antiferromagnetic ground state with compensated moments, providing an interesting platform for exploring exotic material properties. Through careful measurements of magnetization under a series of applied field, we demonstrate that there exist two sequential field-induced magnetic transitions in CoTeMoO6, with one occurring at $H_{c1}$=460 Oe along the a-axis, and the other at $H_{c2}$=1.16 T with the field along the b-axis. The values of H_c1 and H_c2 exhibit strong angular dependence and diverge with different rates as the applied field is rotated 90 degrees within the ab plane. This reflects the distinct nature of these transitions, which is further supported by the different critical behavior of $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$, characterized by the values of $\gamma$,in the function of $H_c=H_0\times(1-\frac{T}{T_c})^n$. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that there exist structural and magnetic twin domains in CoTeMoO6 that strongly affect the experimental measurement of their macroscopic properties. Intriguingly, these twin domains can be related to the orthorhombicity/chirality of the crystal structure with the space group $P2_1 2_1 2$. We further explored the magnetic and structural domains with uniaxial pressure and polarized light microscopy. Our results suggest that CoTeMoO6 could be used as a unique platform for investigating the intriguing physics involving intertwined degrees of freedom. The tunability of the underlying domain distribution and its strong anisotropy could also be useful for developing functional devices and applications.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently discovered class of magnetic material with great potential for applications in the field of spintronics, owing to their non-relativistic spin-splitting and simultaneous antiferromagnetic order. One of the most studied candidates for altermagnetic materials is rutile structured RuO2. However, it has recently come under significant scrutiny as evidence emerged for its lack of any magnetic order. In this work, we study bilayers of epitaxial RuO2 and ferromagnetic permalloy (Fe19Ni81) by time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, probing for three possible mechanisms of laser-induced charge dynamics: the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE), electrical anisotropic conductivity (EAC), and inverse altermagnetic spin-splitting effect (IASSE). We examine films of four common RuO2 layer orientations: (001), (100), (110), and (101). If RuO2 is altermagnetic, then the (100) and (101) oriented samples are expected to produce anisotropic emission from the IASSE, however, our results do not indicate the presence of IASSE for either as-deposited or field annealed samples. The THz emission from all samples is instead consistent with charge dynamics induced by only the relativistic ISHE and the non-relativistic and non-magnetic EAC, casting further doubt on the existence of altermagnetism in RuO2. In addition, we find that in the (101) oriented RuO2 sample, the combination of ISHE and EAC emission mechanisms produces THz emission which is tunable between linear and elliptical polarization by modulation of the external magnetic field.

Abstract: We predict the existence of anisotropic spin-transfer torque effect in textured altermagnets. To this end, we generalize the Zhang-Li torque to incorporate the symmetry associated with prototypical $d$-wave altermagnets and identify the spin-splitter adiabatic and nonadiabatic torques. Applying our results to domain wall dynamics induced by spin-transfer torque, we find that, in certain regimes, the spin-splitter adiabatic torque can induce domain wall precession, significantly slowing down domain wall motion. The response of the domain wall also becomes anisotropic, reflecting the $d$-wave symmetry of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we observe that the spin-splitter adiabatic torque modifies skyrmion dynamics, inducing anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect. The above phenomena can serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in textured magnets, distinguishing it from the behavior of ordinary antiferromagnets.

Abstract: We investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital model. There are two symmetric bands $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, as well as two antisymmetric ones $\beta$ and $\delta$. It is found that the $\gamma$ band induces considerable ferromagnetic spin fluctuation and prefers an odd-frequency, $s$-wave spin triplet pairing state. The addition of the other bands gradually suppresses the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation and enhances the antiferromagnetic ones. The superconducting pairing then evolves from a spin triplet into a $d$-wave spin singlet, and finally into an $s_\pm$-wave one. The competition between the $d$-wave and $s_\pm$-wave pairings relies on whether the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation is suppressed completely or not.

Abstract: We discover that a large family of [Pb$_2$F$_2$]- and [Bi$_2$O$_2$]-based mixed-anion materials with a litharge-type structural unit are highly polarizable layered semiconductors on the edge of ferroelectricity. First-principles calculations demonstrate that in this family of materials, compounds as diverse as PbFBr, BiOCl, BiCuOSe, Bi$_2$OS$_2$, and Bi$_5$O$_4$S$_3$Cl exhibit static dielectric constants an order of magnitude higher than typical semiconductors. Additionally, they undergo a ferroelectric transition when subjected to a few percent of tensile strain. The ferroelectric transitions of these materials are found to have a universal origin in the strong cross-bandgap hybridization of the cation $p$ orbitals, enabled by the cation 6s$^2$ lone-pair electrons and the litharge-type structure of the [Pb$_2$F$_2$] and [Bi$_2$O$_2$] layers, as demonstrated by the strain-induced ferroelectric transition in the archetypal litharge $\alpha$-PbO. These results establish materials with a litharge-type structural unit as a large and versatile family of highly polarizable layered semiconductors in proximity to ferroelectricity, offering vast opportunities for multifunctional materials design.

Abstract: Nanoscale topological spin textures in magnetic systems are emerging as promising candidates for scalable quantum architectures. Despite their potential as qubits, previous studies have been limited to semiclassical approaches, leaving a critical gap: the lack of a fully quantum demonstration. Here, we address this challenge by employing the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to establish domain wall (DW) qubits in coupled quantum spin-1/2 chains. We calculate the ground-state energies and excitation gaps of the system and find that DWs with opposite chiralities form a well-defined low-energy sector, distinctly isolated from higher excited states in the presence of anisotropies. This renders the chirality states suitable for encoding quantum information, serving as robust qubits. Interestingly, when a magnetic field is applied, we observe tunneling between quantum DW states with opposite chiralities. Through quantum simulations, we construct an effective qubit Hamiltonian that exhibits strongly anisotropic $g$-factors, offering a way to implement single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we obtain an effective interacting Hamiltonian for two mobile DWs in coupled quantum spin chains from DMRG simulations, enabling the implementation of two-qubit gates. Our work represents a critical step from semiclassical constructions to a fully quantum demonstration of the potential of DW textures for scalable quantum computing, establishing a solid foundation for future quantum architectures based on topological magnetic textures.

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high porosity and large internal surface area, provide versatile platforms for integrating spin centers with potential applications in catalysis and quantum sensing. Here, we identify a stable NH$\cdot$ radical spin center in UiO-66-NH$_2$, a zirconium-based MOF with aminoterephthalic acid (TPA-NH$_2$) linkers. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we determine the nature and spin Hamiltonian parameters of this radical. We also demonstrate that the NH$\cdot$ spin center exhibits a relatively long coherence time, making it a strong candidate for quantum sensing. Since this spin center is intrinsic to TPA-NH$_2$ linkers, our findings open new directions for leveraging organic radicals in MOFs for quantum technologies beyond the UiO-66-NH$_2$ family.

Abstract: A magnetic Weyl semimetal presents the intriguing possibility of controlling topological properties through magnetic order. The kagome compound \CoSnS~has emerged as one of the most thoroughly characterized magnetic Weyl semimetals, yet the potential coexistence of a ferromagnetic state below $T_c$ = 172~K with a non-collinear antiferromagnetic phase or a glassy state remains unresolved. We employ $^{59}$Co NMR to gain a local perspective on the magnetic order. The magnetic and electric field gradient tensors at room temperature are determined by fitting the NMR spectra using evolutionary algorithms. Zero-field NMR measurements reveal that all Co sites are equivalent in the magnetic phase at low temperatures and up to 90~K. The local magnetic field follows in intensity the macroscopic magnetization as a function of temperature and is tilted from the c-axis by a few degrees toward the nearest triangle center. Above 90~K, a shoulder appears on the low-field side, which we attribute to a preferential tilting of the local field in one direction, breaking the equivalence between the three Co sites of the kagome structure. We rule out any coexistence with an in-plane antiferromagnetic phase and suggest instead that in-plane ferromagnetic-like moments appear above 90~K and play an increasing role in the magnetic order up to the magnetic transition.

Abstract: Controlling magnetic textures at ever smaller length and time scales is of key fundamental and technological interest. Achieving nanoscale control often relies on finding an external stimulus that is able to act on that small length scales, which is highly challenging. A promising alternative is to achieve nanoscale control using the inhomogeneity of the magnetic texture itself. Using a multilayered ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt thin-film structure as a model system, we employ a magnetic force microscope to investigate the change in magnetic nanotextures induced by circularly polarized picosecond laser pulses. Starting from a saturated magnetic state, we find stochastic nucleation of complex nanotextured domain networks. In particular, the growth of these domains depends not only on their macroscopic magnetization but also on the complexity of the domain texture. This helicity and texture-dependent effect contrasts with the typical homogeneous growth of magnetic domains initiated by an effective magnetic field of a circularly polarized laser pulse. We corroborate our findings with a stochastic model for the nucleation of magnetic domains, in which the nucleation and annihilation probability not only depends on the helicity of light but also on the relative magnetization orientation of neighboring domains. Our results establish a new approach to investigate ultrafast nanoscale magnetism and photo-excitation across first-order phase transitions.

Abstract: Micromagnetic simulations were employed to investigate the dynamics of a single skyrmion within an antiferromagnetic nanostripe with spatially engineered magnetic properties. This study investigates skyrmion motion within an antiferromagnetic nanostripe engineered with trapezoidal regions of enhanced magnetic anisotropy, enabling diode-like functionality by selectively directing skyrmion movement. Our findings demonstrate that skyrmions can cross these barriers in one direction while being obstructed in the reverse direction, mimicking diode behavior. A detailed analysis is presented on how geometric parameters, such as the inclination angle of the trapezoidal barriers, impact skyrmion motion and device efficacy. Additionally, we reveal that an optimal combination of current density and anisotropy is essential to facilitate efficient skyrmion transport through the nanostripe without reverse movement or annihilation. This work advances the development of skyrmion-based devices for spintronic applications. It provides valuable insights into designing structures that harness controlled topological dynamics

Abstract: The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in the lanthanum hydride LaH$_{10}$ has revolutionized this field of research. Until recently, the need to use diamond anvils for the synthesis of polyhydrides severely limited the list of experimental techniques that could be used to study these materials. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the key methods for probing spin systems of superconductors. In this work, we show how 1H NMR measurements can be realized in diamond anvil cells to study high-temperature superconductivity in lanthanum polyhydrides at pressures up to 165 GPa. We observed a pronounced suppression of the 1H NMR signal intensity below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 260 K in a magnetic field of 7 T, corresponding to the screening of the radio-frequency pulses by the newly discovered superhydride LaH$_{12}$.Below the critical temperature of superconductivity, all 1H NMR characteristics, including the spin-lattice relaxation rate $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$, demonstrate pronounced features, indicating a superconducting transition in the sample. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, the radio-frequency signal transmission through the LaH$_{12}$ sample shows a pronounced drop below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 267 K, confirming the superconducting nature of the transition. Fitting the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation data allows the estimation of the superconducting gap $\textit{${\Delta}$(0)}$ between 427 and 671 K (corresponding to 36.8 to 57.8 meV), and the ratio $\textit{R$_{\Delta}$ = 2${\Delta}$(0)/k$_B$T$_c$}$ between 3.76 and 5.16 in the synthesized hydride sample.

Abstract: The interplay between half-metallic ferromagnetism and spin-orbit coupling within the inversion symmetry-broken structure of half Heuslers provides an ideal platform for various spintronics functionalities. Taking advantage of good lattice matching, it is highly desired to epitaxially integrate promising Heuslers into III-V semiconductor-based devices. PtMnSb is one of the first half Heuslers predicted to be an above-room-temperature half-metal with large spin orbit coupling, however, its half-metallicity and potential as a spintronics material has remained elusive due to lack of high quality samples. Here we demonstrate epitaxial growth of single crystal PtMnSb(001) film on GaSb(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Direct observation of the band structure via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and many-body perturbation theory within the quasiparticle self-consistent GW approximation (QPGW) reveal that PtMnSb hosts rather a near-halfmetallic state with both spin bands crossing the Fermi level and with high spin polarization over 90%. Temperature dependence of magnetization also shows an anomalous enhancement below 60 K, which can be associated with the development of such a near-half-metallic state at low temperatures. Epitaxial growth of high crystalline PtMnSb on a III-V paves the way for systematic clarification of its spin transport properties with fine-tuning of strain in heterostructure devices.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BDG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture diposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which supports topological MZMs at the end of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to a superconducting diode effect in Shiba chain where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the asymmetric FFLO state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.

Abstract: We present comprehensive high magnetic field studies of the alternating weakly coupled ferro-antiferromagnetic (FM-AFM) spin-$1/2$ chain compound Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Br, with the structure of the natural mineral botallackite. Our measurements reveal a broad magnetization plateau at about half of the saturation value, strongly suggesting that the FM chain sublattice becomes fully polarized, while the AFM chain sublattice remains barely magnetized, in magnetic fields at least up to $50$ T. We confirm a spin-reorientation transition for magnetic fields applied in the $ac^\ast$-plane, whose angular dependence is described in the framework of the mean-field theory. Employing high-field THz spectroscopy, we reveal a complex pattern of high-frequency spinon-magnon bound-state excitations. On the other hand, at lower frequencies we observe two modes of antiferromagnetic resonance, as a consequence of the long-range magnetic ordering. We demonstrate that applied magnetic field tends to suppress the long-range magnetic ordering; the temperature-field phase diagram of the phase transition is obtained for magnetic fields up to $14$ T for three principal directions ($a$, $b$, $c^\ast$).

Abstract: The dynamics of swimming bacteria depend on the properties of their habitat media. Recently it was shown that the motion of swimming bacteria dispersed directly in a non-toxic water-based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal can be controlled by the director field of the liquid crystal. Here we investigate whether the macroscopic polar order of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) can be recognized by bacteria B. Subtilis swimming in a water dispersion adjacent to a glassy NF film by surface interactions alone. We show that B. Subtilis tends to move in the direction antiparallel to the spontaneous electric polarization at the NF surface. Their speed was found to be the same with or without a polar NF layer. In contrast to observation on crystal ferroelectric films, the bacteria do not get immobilized. These observations may offer a pathway to creation of polar microinserts to direct bacterial motion in-vivo.

Abstract: Engineering sublattice imbalance is an intuitive way to induce high-spin ground states in bipartite polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs). Such high-spin molecules can be employed as building blocks of quantum spin chains, which are outstanding platforms to study many-body physics and fundamental models in quantum magnetism. Recent reports on the bottom-up synthesis of antiferromagnetic molecular spin chains provided insights into paradigmatic quantum phenomena such as fractionalization. In contrast to antiferromagnetism, demonstration of ferromagnetic coupling between PCHs has been scarce. Previous attempts in this direction were limited by the formation of non-benzenoid rings leading to spin quenching, or the use of spacer motifs that considerably weaken the magnitude of ferromagnetic exchange. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of short ferromagnetic spin chains based on dibenzotriangulene (DBT), a PCH with a triplet ground state. Our synthetic strategy centers on achieving a direct (that is, without a spacer motif) majority-minority sublattice coupling between adjacent units. This leads to a global sublattice imbalance in spin chains scaling with the chain length, and therefore a ferromagnetic ground state with a strong intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange. By means of scanning probe measurements and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry calculations, we analyze the electronic and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic dimers and trimers of DBT, and confirm their quintet and septet ground states, respectively, with an intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange of 7 meV. Furthermore, we elucidate the role of sublattice coupling on magnetism through complementary experiments on antiferromagnetic DBT dimers with majority-majority and minority-minority couplings. We expect our proof-of-principle study to provide impetus for the design of purely organic ferromagnetic materials.

Abstract: The antiferromagnetic parent phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates has been established as a N\'eel state of copper moments, but early work pointed out the important role of ligand oxygen orbitals. Using the three-orbital Emery model we show how doping-induced antiferromagnetic ordering of weak magnetic moments on the oxygen sites can lead to unconventional d-wave magnetism with spin-split electronic bands. Our mechanism for forming such altermagnetic (AM) states in cuprates does not rely on a lowering of the crystal symmetry but rather on interaction-induced formation of magnetic moments on directional oxygen orbitals within the crystallographic unit cell. Therefore, we obtain two different types of AM, namely a (0,0)-AM and a ($\pi$,$\pi$)-AM, and identify different mechanisms for appearance supported by Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization calculations. We finally suggest a scenario to realize the unconventional spin-split bands in a candidate compound by density functional theory and discuss experimental implications.

Abstract: Er3+ color centers are promising candidates for quantum science and technology due to their long electron and nuclear spin coherence times, as well as their desirable emission wavelength. By selecting host materials with suitable, controllable properties, we introduce new parameters that can be used to tailor the Er3+ emission spectrum. PbTiO3 is a well-studied ferroelectric material with known methods of engineering different domain configurations through epitaxial strain. By distorting the structure of Er3+-doped PbTiO3 thin films, we can manipulate the crystal fields around the Er3+ dopant. This is resolved through changes in the Er3+ resonant fluorescence spectra, tying the optical properties of the defect directly to the domain configurations of the ferroelectic matrix. Additionally, we are able to resolve a second set of peaks for films with in-plane ferroelectric polarization. We hypothesize these results to be due to either the Er3+ substituting different sites of the PbTiO3 crystal, differences in charges between the Er3+ dopant and the original substituent ion, or selection rules. Systematically studying the relationship between the Er3+ emission and the epitaxial strain of the ferroelectric matrix lays the pathway for future optical studies of spin manipulation by altering ferroelectric order parameters

Abstract: Hyperpolarized nanoparticles (NPs) offer high polarization levels with room temperature relaxation times exceeding half an hour. In this work, we demonstrate that the achievable hyperpolarization enhancement and relaxation (decay) time at room temperature are largely independent of the particle size contrary to previous assumptions. This is explained through first-principles spin-diffusion coefficient calculations and finite-element polarization simulations. The simulated zero-quantum (flip-flop) line width governing the spin diffusion is found to agree with the experimentally accessible single-quantum (single spin flip, e.g. radio-frequency pulse) line width. The transport of hyperpolarization from strongly hyperfine-coupled spins towards the bulk is most likelybelieved to be responsible for the slow polarization dynamics including long room temperature decay time. The line width and spin-diffusion simulations are extended to other cubic crystal structures and analytical expressions, which only require insertion of the gyromagnetic ratio, lattice constant, isotope abundance and measured spectral density distribution (nuclear line width), are fitted. The presented simulations can be adjusted to study spin diffusion in other materials.

Abstract: We numerically study the first and the second order topological states of electromagnetic (EM) wave in the three-dimensional (3D) woodpile photonic crystal (PhC). The recent studies on 3D PhCs have mainly focused on the observation of the topological states. Here, we not only focus on finding the topological states but also propose a numerical calculation method for topological invariants, which is based on the Wilson loop. For the 3D woodpile PhC, the topological states emerge due to the finite difference in the winding number or partial Chern number. The selection rule for the emergence of topological hinge states is also pointed out based on the topological invariants. Our numerical calculation results are essential and put a step toward the experimental realization of topological waveguide in 3D PhCs.

Abstract: Magnon blockade (MB) serves as an efficient mechanism for generating a single magnon, which holds significance in quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a scheme to realize magnon blockade effects in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG\thinspace micromagnet and a skyrmion. Through numerical simulations, we explore the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under various parameter regimes and examine the influence of the ambient thermal noise on the magnon blockade effects. The results indicate that the behavior of the second-order correlation function for the magnon mode critically depends on the skyrmion qubit-magnon coupling strength and the drive detuning. By tuning the drive field, the system effectively suppresses multi-magnon state and yields a high-purity single-magnon state, exhibiting pronounced antibunching and magnon blockade effects. This scheme provides a feasible and versatile new all-magnetic platform for achieving high-purity single-magnon sources.

Abstract: The processing unit of a solid-state quantum computer consists in an array of coupled qubits, each locally driven with on-chip microwave lines that route carefully-engineered control signals to the qubits in order to perform logical operations. This approach to quantum computing comes with two major problems. On the one hand, it greatly hampers scalability towards fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are estimated to need a number of qubits -- and, therefore driving lines -- on the order of $10^6$. On the other hand, these lines are a source of electromagnetic noise, exacerbating frequency crowding and crosstalk, while also contributing to power dissipation inside the dilution fridge. We here tackle these two overwhelming challenges by presenting a novel quantum processing unit (QPU) for a universal quantum computer which is globally (rather than locally) driven. Our QPU relies on a string of superconducting qubits with always-on ZZ interactions, enclosed into a closed geometry, which we dub ``conveyor belt''. Strikingly, this architecture requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ physical qubits to run a computation on $N$ computational qubits, in contrast to previous $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ proposals for global quantum computation. Additionally, universality is achieved via the implementation of single-qubit gates and a one-shot Toffoli gate. The ability to perform multi-qubit operations in a single step could vastly improve the fidelity and execution time of many algorithms.

Abstract: We study the silicon vacancy in 3C SiC as a color center of interest in the field of Quantum Technologies, focusing on its magnetic interaction with the SiC nuclear spin bath containing Si29 and C13 nuclei in their natural isotopic concentration. We calculate the system energetic and magnetic properties with ab initio methods based on the Density Functional Theory, identifying the neutral charge state of the silicon vacancy as the most favorable for p doped 3C SiC systems. We thereon evaluate the Free Induction Decay and the Hahn echo sequence on the electron spin interacting with the nuclear spin bath. Here, the Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation phenomenon, due to single nuclear spin flipping processes, and the overall decay are highlighted in the context of the Cluster Correlation Expansion theory. We find a non exponential coherence decay, which is a typical feature of solid state qubits subjected to low frequency 1/f noise from the environment.

Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and spin correlations in frustrated Kitaev quantum materials offers an ideal platform to host non-trivial quantum states with exotic fractional excitations. The signature of spin-freezing behavior of these spin-orbit-driven frustrated magnets is characterized by a bifurcation of zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures much below the characteristic interaction energy scale of spins. The temperature dependence of magnetic specific heat exhibits Cm~ T^2 dependence near the freezing temperature. The field-independent behavior of Cm below the freezing temperature implies the presence of exotic low-energy excitations. The aging and memory effect experiments in the Kitaev magnets suggest a non-hierarchical free energy distribution, which differs from the hierarchical organization of conventional spin-freezing. Furthermore, the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate follows a power law behavior below the spin-freezing temperature, suggesting the persistence of unconventional spin excitation spectra. Herein, we demonstrate that the observed low-temperature spin-freezing phenomena in a few representative Kitaev quantum materials can be effectively explained by the Halperin and Saslow (HS) hydrodynamic modes relevant for non-trivial spin glass materials. The linearly dispersive HS modes are hypothesized to account for instigating non-abelian defect propagation, thereby inducing a spin jam state in the low-temperature regime in frustrated Kitaev magnets. Our investigation reveals that HS modes capture the essence of unconventional spin-freezing ascribed to topological origin in two-dimensional (2D) Kitaev magnets decorated on a honeycomb lattice and its 3D analog hyperhoneycomb that offers a viable ground to extend this framework to a large class of frustrated quantum materials.

Abstract: The subclass of collinear antiferromagnets where spin Kramers degeneracy is broken -- resulting in ferromagnetic-like properties -- offers exciting new opportunities in magnetism and hence motivates the reasoned expansion of the material base for these so-called altermagnets. Here, we show that Ruddlesden-Popper and perovskite phases are generic hosts for altermagnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate altermagnetism in prototypical nickel-based systems such as La$_2$NiO$_4$ and identify additional candidates, including the superconducting La$_3$Ni$_3$O$_7$ and the multiferroic BiFeO$_3$. These materials span insulating, semiconducting, and metallic conduction types, with computed nonrelativistic spin splittings reaching up to 250~meV. Our analysis also reveals the presence of accidental nodes and distinct topologies in the spin-momentum texture at the Brillouin-zone boundary, suggesting a refined classification for altermagnetic materials beyond the $d$-wave or higher even-parity wave classes. In addition, we address formal inconsistencies in the traditional classification of magnetically ordered systems, proposing resolutions grounded in the altermagnetic framework, and point out the potential for altermagnetic behavior in systems beyond collinear antiferromagnets with perfectly compensated magnetization, broadening the scope for future exploration.

Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals present a compelling platform for exploring topological defects in polar fields, while their structural properties can be significantly altered by ionic doping. In this study, we demonstrate that doping the ferroelectric nematic material RM734 with cationic polymers enable the formation of polymeric micelles that connect pairs of half-integer topological defects. Polarizing optical microscopy reveals that these string defects exhibit butterfly textures, featured with a two-dimensional polarization field divided by N\'eel-type kink-walls into domains exhibiting either uniform polarization or negative splay and bend deformations. Through analysis of electrophoretic motion and direct measurements of polarization divergences, we show that the string micelles are positively charged and their side regions exhibit positive bound charges. To elucidate these observations, we propose a charge double layer model for the string defects: the positive charged cationic polymer chains and densely packed RM734 molecules form a Stern charge layer, while small anionic ions and positive bound charges constitute the charge diffusion layer. Notably, our experiments indicate that only cationic polymer doping effectively induces the formation of these unique string defects. These findings enhance our understanding of ionic doping effects and provide valuable insights for engineering polar topologies in liquid crystal systems.

Abstract: Pair density waves (PDWs) are a inhomogeneous superconducting states whose Cooper pairs possess a finite momentum resulting in a oscillatory gap in space, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. There is growing evidence for the existence of PDW superconducting order in many strongly correlated materials, particularly in the cuprate superconductors and in several other different types of systems.
  A feature of the PDW state is that inherently it has a CDW as a composite order associated with it. Here we study the structure of the electronic topological defects of the PDW, paying special attention to the half-vortex and its electronic structure that can be detected in STM experiments. We discuss tell-tale signatures of the defects in violations of inversion symmetry, in the excitation spectrum and their spectral functions in the presence of topological defects. We discuss the ``Fermi surface'' topology of Bogoliubov quasiparticle of the PDW phases, and we briefly discuss the role of quasiparticle interference.

Abstract: The recent observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in moir\'e fractional Chern insulators provides an opportunity to investigate zero magnetic field anyons. To potentially realize non-Abelian anyons, one approach is to engineer higher flat Chern bands that mimic higher Landau levels. Here, we investigate the interaction, topology, and ferromagnetism of the second moir\'e miniband in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. At half filling of the second miniband, we observe spontaneous ferromagnetism and an incipient Chern insulator state. The Chern numbers of the top two moir\'e flat bands exhibit opposite signs for twist angles above 3.1{\deg}, but share the same sign near 2.6{\deg}, consistent with theoretical predictions. In the 2.6{\deg} device, increasing magnetic field induces a topological phase transition via band crossing between opposite valleys, resulting in an emergent state with Chern number C = -2. Additionally, an insulating state at half filling of the second valley-polarized band suggests a charge-ordered state is favored over the fractional Chern insulator state. These findings lay a foundation for understanding the higher flat Chern bands, crucial for the discovery of non-Abelian fractional Chern insulators.

Abstract: Magnons offer a promising path toward energy-efficient information transmission and the development of next-generation classical and quantum computing technologies. However, methods to efficiently excite, manipulate, and detect magnons remain a critical need. Here, we show that magnons, despite their charge-neutrality, can induce electric polarization as a result of both their spin and orbital moments. We demonstrate this by calculating the electric polarization induced by magnons in two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb antiferromagnets. The electric polarization becomes finite when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) is present and its magnitude can be increased by symmetries of the system. We illustrate this by computing and comparing the electric polarizations induced by the magnon Nernst effects in 2D materials with N\'eel and Zigzag ordering. Our findings show that in the Zigzag order, where the effect is dominated by the magnon orbital moment, the induced electric polarization is approximately three orders of magnitude greater than in the N\'eel phase. These findings reveal that electric fields could enable both detection and manipulation of magnons under certain conditions by leveraging their spin and orbital angular moment. They also suggest that the discovery or engineering of materials with substantial magnon orbital moments could lead to more practical use of magnons for future computing and information transmission device applications.

Abstract: The orbital Hall effect (OHE), resulting from non-trivial quantum geometry of 2D materials, has several potential advantages over the spin Hall effect (SHE), the latter being well known for its many applications in spintronics. Like the spin Hall effect, the OHE occurs in nonmagnetic materials without stringent symmetry requirements, but unlike the SHE it does no rely on relatively weak spin-orbit interaction. In 2D materials, these advantages risk to be nullified by the difficulty of turning the orbital moment away from the out-of-plane direction. Multilayered 2D materials offer a way out of this difficulty because the fluctuating in-plane component of the orbital moment, due to motion of electrons between the layers, can latch to a magnetic field. To describe this effect we have derived a semi-phenomenological equation of motion for the density of orbital magnetic moment in stacked 2D materials subjected to a magnetic field. Unlike the equations of motion for the spin, these equations produce a strongly anisotropic dynamics, which is governed by an inverse effective mass tensor for which we provide a fully microscopic expression. As a first application, we combine our equation of motion with phenomenological drift-diffusion equations to obtain a theory of orbital Hanle magnetoresistance in multilayered 2D materials.

Abstract: We propose and characterize a novel two-dimensional material, 2D-CRO, derived from bulk calcium-based ruthenates (CROs) of the Ruddlesden-Popper family, Ca$_{n+1}$Ru$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n = 1$ and $2$). Using density functional theory, we demonstrate that 2D-CRO maintains structural stability down to the monolayer limit, exhibiting a tight interplay between structural and electronic properties. Notably, 2D-CRO displays altermagnetic behavior, characterized by zero net magnetization and strong spin-dependent phenomena, stabilized through dimensionality reduction. This stability is achieved by breaking inversion symmetry along the z-axis, favoring altermagnetic properties even in the absence of van der Waals interactions. Through theoretical models and computational analysis, we explore the altermagnetic behavior of 2D-CRO, both with and without spin-orbit coupling. We identify the spin components that contribute to the altermagnetic character and highlight the potential of 2D-CRO as a promising material for investigating altermagnetic phenomena and topological features.

Abstract: Interlayer coupling plays a critical role in tuning the electronic structures and magnetic ground states of two-dimensional materials, influenced by the number of layers, interlayer distances, and stacking order. However, its effect on the orientation of the magnetic easy axis remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that interlayer coupling can significantly alter the magnetic easy-axis orientation, as shown by the magnetic easy-axis of monolayer 1T-MnSe2 tilting 67{\deg} from the z-axis, while aligning with the z-axis in the bilayer. This change results from variations in orbital occupations near the Fermi level, particularly involving nonmetallic Se atoms. Contrary to the traditional focus on magnetic metal atoms, our findings reveal that Se orbitals play a key role in influencing the easy-axis orientation and topological Chern numbers. Furthermore, we validated our conclusions by changing stacking orders, introducing charge doping, applying in-plane biaxial strains, and substituting non-metallic atoms. Our results highlight the pivotal role of interlayer coupling in tuning the magnetic properties of layered materials, with important implications for spintronic applications.

Abstract: We investigate the design of magnetic ordering in one-dimensional mesoscopic magnetic Ising chains by modulating long-range interactions. These interactions are affected by geometrical modifications to the chain, which adjust the energy hierarchy and the resulting magnetic ground states. Consequently, the magnetic ordering can be tuned between antiferromagnetic and dimer antiferromagnetic phases. These phases are experimentally observed in chains fabricated using both conventional electron-beam lithography and ion implantation techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of controlling magnetic properties at the mesoscale. The ability of attaining these magnetic structures by thermal annealing, underlines the potential of using such systems instead of simulated annealers in tackling combinatorial optimization tasks.

As an illustration of its capabilities, we show that mumax+ can predict antiferromagnetic domain walls and their velocity induced by spin transfer torques, as well as the dispersion relations for antiferromagnetic spin waves, elastic waves, and their magnetoelastic anticrossing behavior.

Abstract: We measure the dynamical behavior of colloidal singlets and dumbbells on an inclined magnetic moir\'e pattern, subject to a precessing external homogeneous magnetic field. At low external field strength single colloidal particles and dumbbells move everywhere on the pattern: At stronger external field strengths colloidal singlets and dumbbells are localized in generic locations. There are however nongeneric locations of flat channels that cross the moir\'e Wigner Seitz cell. In the flat channels we find gravitational driven translational and non-translational dynamic phase behavior of the colloidal singlets and dumbbells depending on the external field strength and the precession angle of the external homogeneous magnetic field.

Abstract: Research on time crystals concerns the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in time, as well as the realization of phenomena and phases known from solid-state physics in the time domain. Periodically driven systems of massive particles are widely used in these studies. In the present work, we consider a photonic system and demonstrate that stable nonlinear propagation of a strong optical wave in a fiber leads to the establishment of quasi-periodic oscillations in the electromagnetic field intensity. A second, weaker signal optical wave propagating in the fiber senses these oscillations and, as a result, undergoes exponential localization in time. This is a temporal analogue of Aubry-Andre localization. If an optical detector is placed at a certain position in the fiber, the temporal localization of the probe wave will be observed in the form of the signal which emerges and then decays as a function of time.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum information processing with superconducting qubits have fueled a growing demand for scaling and miniaturizing circuit layouts. Despite significant progress, predicting the Hamiltonian of complex circuits remains a challenging task. Here, we propose an improved method for quantizing superconducting circuits that incorporates material- and geometry-dependent kinetic inductance. Our approach models superconducting films as reactive boundary elements, seamlessly integrating into the conventional circuit quantization framework without adding computational complexity. We experimentally validate our method using superconducting devices fabricated with 35 nm-thick disordered niobium films, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy in predicting the Hamiltonian based solely on the device layout and material properties of superconducting films and Josephson junctions. Specifically, conventional methods exhibit an average error of 5.4% in mode frequencies, while our method reduces it to 1.1%. Our method enables systematic studies of superconducting devices with disordered films or compact elements, facilitating precise engineering of superconducting circuits at scale.

Abstract: Space weather modelling has been gaining importance due to our increasing dependency on technology sensitive to space weather effects, such as satellite services, air traffic and power grids. Improving the reliability, accuracy and numerical performance of space weather modelling tools, including global coronal models, is essential to develop timely and accurate forecasts and to help partly mitigate the space weather threat. Global corona models, however, require accurate boundary conditions, for the formulations of which we have very limited observational data. Unsuitable boundary condition prescriptions may lead to inconsistent features in the solution flow field and spoil the code's accuracy and performance. In this paper, we develop an adjustment to the inner boundary condition of the COCONUT global corona model to better capture the dynamics over and around the regions of stronger magnetic fields by constraining the plasma \b{eta} and the Alfv\'en speed. Using data from solar observations and solar atmospheric modelling codes such as Bifrost, we find that the baseline homogeneous boundary condition formulations for pressure and density do not capture the plasma conditions physically accurately. We develop a method to adjust these prescribed pressure and density values by placing constraints on the plasma \b{eta} and the Alfv\'en speed that act as proxies. We demonstrate that we can remove inexplicable fast streams from the solution by constraining the maximum Alfv\'en speed and the minimum plasma \b{eta} on the boundary surface. We also show that the magnetic topology is not significantly affected by this treatment otherwise. The presented technique shows the potential to ease the modelling of solar maxima, especially removing inexplicable features while, at the same time, not significantly affecting the magnetic field topology around the affected regions.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore classical electromagnetic radiation using a dual four-dimensional potential $\Theta^\mu$ approach. Our focus is on the Planar Dipole Blade Antenna (PDBA), a system consisting of two flat conductive regions on the $xy$-plane, separated by a gap $\mathcal{G}$, with alternating potentials applied to the conductors. This method emphasizes the use of the scalar magnetic potential $\Psi(\boldsymbol{r},t)$ and the electric vector potential $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$, which generates the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}(\boldsymbol{r},t)=\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\Theta}(\boldsymbol{r},t)$ in free space. These potentials replace the standard magnetic vector potential $\boldsymbol{A}$ and the scalar electric potential $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ in our analysis. For harmonic radiation, the electromagnetic field can be expressed in terms of the electric vector potential $\boldsymbol{\Theta}(\boldsymbol{r},t)$. We derive a corresponding retarded vector potential for $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$ in terms of a two-dimensional vector field $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{W}}(\boldsymbol{r},t)$, which flows through the gap region $\mathcal{G}$. This dual analytical approach yields mathematically equivalent expressions for modeling Planar Blade Antennas, analogous to those used for ribbons in the region $\mathcal{G}$, simplifying the mathematical problem. In the gapless limit, this approach reduces the two-dimensional radiator (PDBA) to a one-dimensional wire-loop-like antenna, significantly simplifying the problem's dimensionality. This leads to a dual version of Jefimenko's equations for the electric field, where $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{W}}$ behaves like a surface current in the gap region and satisfies a continuity condition. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we provide an analytical solution for a PDBA with a thin annular gap at low frequency.

Abstract: Temperature gradients developed at ultra-high temperatures create a challenge for temperature measurements that are required for material processing. At ultra-high temperatures, the components of the system can react and change phases depending on their thermodynamic stability. These reactions change the system's physical properties, such as thermal conductivity and fluidity. This phenomenon complicates the extrapolation of temperature measurements, as they depend on the thermal conductivity of multiple insulating layers. The proposed model is an induction furnace employing an electromagnetic field to generate heat reaching 2500 degrees Celsius. A heat transfer simulation applying the finite element method determined temperatures and verified experimentally at key locations on the surface of the experimental setup within the furnace. The computed temperature profile of cylindrical graphite crucibles embedded in a larger cylindrical graphite body surrounded by zirconia grog is determined. Compared to experimental results, the simulation showed a percentage error of approximately 3.4 percent, confirming its accuracy.

Abstract: The time-varying geomagnetic field is a superposition of contributions from multiple internal and external current systems. A major source of geomagnetic variations at periods less than few years are current systems external to the solid Earth, namely the ionospheric and magnetospheric currents, as well as associated mantle-induced currents. The separation of these three sources is mathematically underdetermined using either ground or satellite measurements alone, but becomes tractable when the two datasets are combined. Based on this concept, we developed a new geomagnetic field modelling approach that allows us to simultaneously characterise the mid-latitude ionospheric, magnetospheric and the internal induced magnetic fields using ground and satellite observations for all local times and magnetic conditions, and without prescribing any harmonic behaviour on these current systems in time, as is typical in other models. By applying this new method to a 10-year dataset of ground observatory and multi-satellite measurements from 2014 to 2023, we obtained the time series of the spherical harmonic coefficients of the ionospheric, magnetospheric and induced fields. These new time series unravel complex non-periodic dynamics of the external magnetic fields during global geomagnetic storms, as well as periodicities in the magnetospheric coefficients linked to solar activities and periodic ionospheric magnetic fields linked to lunar daily variations, contributing to a better picture of the dynamics of the external currents and magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions. Finally, new approach provides more consistent field estimates for electromagnetic induction studies, and, owing to its flexibility and on-the-fly updates, can facilitate space weather operations.

Abstract: The response of the magnetosphere to interplanetary drivers depends on their type. The reliability of their identification affects the conclusions of the analysis of connections between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. In this work, we analyze the list of moderate and strong geomagnetic storms and their interplanetary sources for the period 2009 - 2019, presented in the work of Qiu et al. It is shown that some of the events in this list were identified incorrectly, and their interpretation differs in ~20% of cases from our catalog by Yermolaev et al. (http://www.iki.rssi.ru/pub/omni/) for types of solar wind Sheath, ICME and CIR, and in ~28% of cases from the Richardson and Cane catalog for ICME. Using the unadjusted list of Qiu et al. may lead to incorrect identification of interplanetary drivers of magnetic storms and erroneous conclusions. It is recommended to use the classification of interplanetary events from catalogs of events accepted by the scientific community as reference ones.

Abstract: Fano profiles are observed across various fields of wave physics. They emerge from interference phenomena and are quantified by the asymmetry parameter q. In optics, q is usually considered as a phenomenological coefficient obtained by fitting experimental or numerical data. In this work, we introduce an ab initio Maxwellian approach using quasinormal modes to analytically describe line shapes in light scattering problems. We show that the response of each individual quasinormal mode inherently exhibits a Fano profile and derive an explicit analytical formula for the Fano parameter. Experimental and numerical validations confirm the formula's accuracy across a broad spectrum of electromagnetic systems. The general expression for q opens new possibilities for fine-tuning and optimizing spectral line shapes in electromagnetism.

In this work, we design and analyze twisted bilayer crystals capable of steering light in a direction controlled by the twist angle. In order to achieve beam steering, the device efficiently routes input power into a single, twist-dependent, transmitted diffraction order. The outgoing light then follows the orientation of this diffraction order, externally controlled by the twist angle. The optimization is performed using high-efficiency heuristic optimization method which enabled a data-oriented approach to further understand the design operation. The optimized device demonstrates an efficiency above 90% across twist angles ranging from 0 to 30 degrees for both TE and TM polarizations. Extending the optimization to include left- and right-handed polarizations yields overall accuracy nearing 90% when averaged across the entire 0 to 60 degrees control range. Finally, we show how the device resembles blazed gratings by effectively canceling the undesired diffraction orders. The optimized devices exhibit a shared slant dependent on the selected diffraction order. Our analysis is supported by a structural blazing model arising from the data-oriented statistical analysis.

Abstract: Thin film ferroelectric devices with ultralow power operation, non-volatile data retention and fast and reliable switching are attractive for non-volatile memory and as synaptic weight elements. However, low thermal budget ferroelectric oxides suffer from crystalline inhomogeneity and defects that makes their large-scale circuit integration challenging. Here, we report on the thermally engineered way to induce wafer-scale homogeneity in Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ capacitors that can lead to high device reliability making their integration possible in ultralow power memory and neuromorphic computing hardware.

Abstract: The capability to tailor mutual interactions between colloidal nanoparticles strongly depends on the length scales involved. While electrostatic and optomechanically driven interactions can cover nano and micron-scale landscapes, controlling inter-particle dynamics at larger distances remains a challenge. Small physical and electromagnetic cross-sections of nanoparticles make long-range interactions, screened by a fluid environment, inefficient. To bypass the limitations, we demonstrate that forming micron-scale bubbles around gilded vaterite nanoparticles enables mediating long-range interactions via thermo-optical forces. Femtosecond laser illumination leads to the encapsulation of light-absorbing particles inside long-lasting micron-scale bubbles, which in turn behave as negative lenses refracting incident light. Our experiments reveal the bubble-induced collimation of laser beams, traversing over mm-scale distances. The collimated beams are visualized with the aid of phase-contrast Schlieren imaging, which reveals refractive index variations, caused by temperature gradients within the fluid. We demonstrate that the refracted beams initiate the formation of secondary bubbles around nearby gilded vaterite particles. As the consequence, we demonstrate the ability to control secondary bubble motion by pushing and pulling it with optical radiation pressure force and by thermocapillary Marangoni effect, respectively. The latter facilitates interactions over millimeter-scale distances, which are otherwise unachievable. Apart from exploring new physical effects, mediating long-range interactions can find a use in a range of applications including drug design and screening, photochemistry, design of colloidal suspensions, and many others.

Abstract: We numerically study the first and the second order topological states of electromagnetic (EM) wave in the three-dimensional (3D) woodpile photonic crystal (PhC). The recent studies on 3D PhCs have mainly focused on the observation of the topological states. Here, we not only focus on finding the topological states but also propose a numerical calculation method for topological invariants, which is based on the Wilson loop. For the 3D woodpile PhC, the topological states emerge due to the finite difference in the winding number or partial Chern number. The selection rule for the emergence of topological hinge states is also pointed out based on the topological invariants. Our numerical calculation results are essential and put a step toward the experimental realization of topological waveguide in 3D PhCs.

Abstract: High silicon steel with 6.5% silicon content is the best because of its excellent magnetic properties, such as high saturation magnetization, high resistivity, low iron loss and near zero magnetostriction. High silicon steel can greatly save energy, and reduce the weight and size of electrical appliances. This has a very important application prospect for energy and aerospace industry. The high brittleness of high silicon steel makes its production and processing very difficult. For more than 30 years, many steel companies and research institutions around the world have adopted various technical means to study the industrialization of high silicon steel, but they have not been successful . JFE-NKK steel company in Japan has realized the small batch production of high silicon steel by using SiCl4-CVD technology. However, due to the complex process, corrosion and pollution, high cost, its production scale is greatly limited. So far, large-scale production of high silicon steel is still a major challenge in the world. This paper will introduce the experimental results of successfully preparing high silicon steel by Double Glow Plasma Surface Metallurgy Technology. The process is simple and easy without any corrosion or pollution, which may provide a new way for the world to achieve large-scale production of high silicon steel. The large-scale production and wide application of high silicon steel is likely to change the pattern of the world's energy and electric power industry, save a lot of energy for mankind, and create huge economic benefits.

arXiv:2412.12028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, with their ability to control electromagnetic waves, hold immense potential in optical device design, especially for applications requiring precise control over dispersion. This work introduces an approach to dispersion engineering using heterogeneous freeform metasurfaces, which overcomes the limitations of conventional metasurfaces that often suffer from poor transmission, narrow bandwidth, and restricted polarization responses. By transitioning from single-layer, canonical meta-atoms to bilayer architectures with non-intuitive geometries, our design decouples intrinsic material properties (refractive index and group index), enabling independent engineering of phase and group delays as well as higher-order dispersion properties, while achieving high-efficiency under arbitrary polarization states. We implement a two-stage multi-objective optimization process to generate libraries of meta-atoms, which are then utilized for the rapid design of dispersion-engineered metasurfaces. Additionally, we present a bilayer metasurface stacking technique, paving the way for the realization of high-performance, dispersion-engineered optical devices. Our approach is validated through the demonstration of metasurfaces exhibiting superior chromatic aberration correction and broadband performance, with over 81% averaged efficiency across the 420-nm visible-to-near-infrared bandwidth. Our synergistic combination of advanced design physics, powerful freeform optimization methods, and bi-layer nanofabrication techniques represents a significant breakthrough compared to the state-of-the-art while opening new possibilities for broadband metasurface applications.

Abstract: Finite difference based micromagnetic simulations are a powerful tool for the computational investigation of magnetic structures. In this paper, we demonstrate how the discretization of continuous micromagnetic equations introduces a numerical 'discretization anisotropy'. We demonstrate that, in certain scenarios, this anisotropy operates on an energy scale comparable to that of intrinsic physical phenomena. Furthermore, we illustrate that selecting appropriate finite difference stencils and minimizing the size of the discretization cells are effective strategies to mitigate discretization anisotropy.

arXiv:2412.10633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed 3D MHD simulations to study the effect of partial ionization in the process of magnetic flux emergence in the Sun. In fact, we continue previous work and we now focus: 1) on the emergence of the magnetic fields above the solar photosphere and 2) on the eruptive activity, which follows the emergence into the corona. We find that in the simulations with partial ionization (PI), the structure of the emerging field consists of arch-like fieldlines with very little twist since the axis of the initial rising field remains below the photosphere. The plasma inside the emerging volume is less dense and it is moving faster compared to the fully ionized (FI) simulation. In both cases, new flux ropes (FR) are formed due to reconnection between emerging fieldlines, and they eventually erupt in an ejective manner towards the outer solar atmosphere. We are witnessing three major eruptions in both simulations. At least for the first eruption, the formation of the eruptive FR occurs in the low atmosphere in the FI case and at coronal heights in the PI case. Also, in the first PI eruption, part of the eruptive FR carries neutrals in the high atmosphere, for a short period of time. Overall, the eruptions are relatively faster in the PI case, while a considerable amount of axial flux is found above the photosphere during the eruptions in both simulations.

Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J<0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1<u>|J|<-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J>0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1</u>2<u>|J|<0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U</u>|J|>-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J>0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.

Abstract: We propose a novel detection method for axion dark matter using the Rabi oscillation of neutron spins in beam-based measurements. If axions couple to neutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive transitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field when the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states. The transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with the first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second splitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection capability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \,$eV mass window with the capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.

# On the Ehrenfest theorem and centroids of relativistic particles

**Authors:** Konstantin Y. Bliokh

arXiv:2412.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider relativistic versions of the Ehrenfest relation between the expectation values of the coordinate and momentum of a quantum particle in free space: $d\langle {\bf r} \rangle /dt = \langle {\bf p} \rangle/m$. We find that the simple proportionality between the mean velocity and momentum holds true only for the simplest quadratic dispersion (i.e., dependence of the energy on the momentum). For relativistic dispersion, the mean velocity is generally not collinear with the mean momentum, but velocity of the {\it energy centroid} is directed along the mean momentum. This is related to the conservation of the Lorentz-boost momentum and has implications in possible decomposition of the mean orbital angular momentum into intrinsic and extrinsic parts. Neglecting spin/polarization effects, these properties depend solely on the dispersion relation, and can be applied to any waves, including classical electromagnetic or acoustic fields.

Abstract: We establish an extended version of the kinetic theory of the relativistic axionically active multi-component plasma, which is based on the inclusion of a unit time-like vector field, associated with the velocity of dynamic aether, into the scheme of interactions. The proposed extension of the plasma theory can be indicated as semi-phenomenological. This term means that master equations for the gravitational, electromagnetic, pseudoscalar (axionic) and vector (aetheric) fields are derived using the Lagrange formalism, the kinetic equations for the distribution functions are obtained by the methods of the covariant statistics, however, the relativistic forces acting from the listed fields on the plasma particles are reconstructed phenomenologically based on classical analogies. We consider this work as a first part of a trilogy; here we presented, first, the complete formalism of this extended theory, second, the classification of forces, third, the new concept of equilibrium states in the relativistic axionically - aetherically active plasma.

Abstract: Hybrid magnonics, exploring the coupling between magnons and quantum systems, is an exciting field for developing next-generation information technologies. Achieving a strong and tunable magnon-magnon coupling (MMC) in confined nanomagnets is crucial for the on-chip integration of these hybrid systems and advancing the field. In this work, we numerically investigate the interactions between different magnon modes excited within an elliptical magnonic nano-disc (EMND), demonstrating an anti-crossing effect in the dispersion spectra. A comprehensive theoretical framework was presented that explains this anti-crossing phenomenon as a result of MMC and provide estimates for the strength of the coupling (g). Furthermore, we show that this intermodal coupling can be tuned from a strong coupling regime (g = 300 MHz) to a weak coupling regime by varying the direction of the external magnetic field and the intrinsic properties of the EMND. Our combined numerical and theoretical findings offer new insights into MMC, significantly advancing the field of quantum magnonics and magnon-based quantum information technology.

Abstract: The dynamics of swimming bacteria depend on the properties of their habitat media. Recently it was shown that the motion of swimming bacteria dispersed directly in a non-toxic water-based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal can be controlled by the director field of the liquid crystal. Here we investigate whether the macroscopic polar order of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) can be recognized by bacteria B. Subtilis swimming in a water dispersion adjacent to a glassy NF film by surface interactions alone. We show that B. Subtilis tends to move in the direction antiparallel to the spontaneous electric polarization at the NF surface. Their speed was found to be the same with or without a polar NF layer. In contrast to observation on crystal ferroelectric films, the bacteria do not get immobilized. These observations may offer a pathway to creation of polar microinserts to direct bacterial motion in-vivo.

Abstract: Engineering sublattice imbalance is an intuitive way to induce high-spin ground states in bipartite polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs). Such high-spin molecules can be employed as building blocks of quantum spin chains, which are outstanding platforms to study many-body physics and fundamental models in quantum magnetism. Recent reports on the bottom-up synthesis of antiferromagnetic molecular spin chains provided insights into paradigmatic quantum phenomena such as fractionalization. In contrast to antiferromagnetism, demonstration of ferromagnetic coupling between PCHs has been scarce. Previous attempts in this direction were limited by the formation of non-benzenoid rings leading to spin quenching, or the use of spacer motifs that considerably weaken the magnitude of ferromagnetic exchange. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of short ferromagnetic spin chains based on dibenzotriangulene (DBT), a PCH with a triplet ground state. Our synthetic strategy centers on achieving a direct (that is, without a spacer motif) majority-minority sublattice coupling between adjacent units. This leads to a global sublattice imbalance in spin chains scaling with the chain length, and therefore a ferromagnetic ground state with a strong intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange. By means of scanning probe measurements and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry calculations, we analyze the electronic and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic dimers and trimers of DBT, and confirm their quintet and septet ground states, respectively, with an intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange of 7 meV. Furthermore, we elucidate the role of sublattice coupling on magnetism through complementary experiments on antiferromagnetic DBT dimers with majority-majority and minority-minority couplings. We expect our proof-of-principle study to provide impetus for the design of purely organic ferromagnetic materials.

Abstract: Er3+ color centers are promising candidates for quantum science and technology due to their long electron and nuclear spin coherence times, as well as their desirable emission wavelength. By selecting host materials with suitable, controllable properties, we introduce new parameters that can be used to tailor the Er3+ emission spectrum. PbTiO3 is a well-studied ferroelectric material with known methods of engineering different domain configurations through epitaxial strain. By distorting the structure of Er3+-doped PbTiO3 thin films, we can manipulate the crystal fields around the Er3+ dopant. This is resolved through changes in the Er3+ resonant fluorescence spectra, tying the optical properties of the defect directly to the domain configurations of the ferroelectic matrix. Additionally, we are able to resolve a second set of peaks for films with in-plane ferroelectric polarization. We hypothesize these results to be due to either the Er3+ substituting different sites of the PbTiO3 crystal, differences in charges between the Er3+ dopant and the original substituent ion, or selection rules. Systematically studying the relationship between the Er3+ emission and the epitaxial strain of the ferroelectric matrix lays the pathway for future optical studies of spin manipulation by altering ferroelectric order parameters

Abstract: As quantum computing hardware becomes more complex with ongoing design innovations and growing capabilities, the quantum computing community needs increasingly powerful techniques for fabrication failure root-cause analysis. This is especially true for trapped-ion quantum computing. As trapped-ion quantum computing aims to scale to thousands of ions, the electrode numbers are growing to several hundred with likely integrated-photonic components also adding to the electrical and fabrication complexity, making faults even harder to locate. In this work, we used a high-resolution quantum magnetic imaging technique, based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, to investigate short-circuit faults in an ion trap chip. We imaged currents from these short-circuit faults to ground and compared to intentionally-created faults, finding that the root-cause of the faults was failures in the on-chip trench capacitors. This work, where we exploited the performance advantages of a quantum magnetic sensing technique to troubleshoot a piece of quantum computing hardware, is a unique example of the evolving synergy between emerging quantum technologies to achieve capabilities that were previously inaccessible.

Abstract: Wide-field magnetic microscopy using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can yield high-quality magnetic images of DC and AC magnetic fields. The unique combination of micron-scale spatial resolution of scalar or vector fields at room temperature and parallel camera readout make this an appealing technique for applications in biology, geology, condensed-matter physics, and electronics. However, while NV magnetic microscopy has achieved great success in these areas, historically the accessible frequency range has been limited. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by implementing the recently developed technique of quantum frequency mixing. With this approach, we generate wide-field magnetic images of test structures driven by alternating currents up to 70 MHz, well outside the reach of DC and Rabi magnetometry methods. With further improvements, this approach could find utility in hyperspectral imaging for electronics power spectrum analysis, electronics diagnostics and troubleshooting, and quantum computing hardware validation.

Abstract: We implement the Fock-space perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster theory to compute the electric dipole polarizability of ground and low lying excited states, and nuclear spin-dependent parity violating (NSD-PNC) transition amplitudes in Cs. Moreover, to check the accuracy of the wavefunctions used in the calculations, we compute the excitation energies, E1 transition amplitudes and magnetic dipole hyperfine constants for ground and low lying excited states. To improve the accuracy of the computed properties, we have incorporated the corrections from the relativistic and QED effects in our calculations. The contributions from triple excitations are accounted perturbatively. Our results on excitation energies, E1 transition amplitudes and hyperfine constants are in good agreement with the available experimental results. Our polarizability results using FS-PRCC theory match well with the experimental values. The values of parity-violating transition amplitudes from our calculations are, in general, on the lower side of the previous values. From the detail analysis of electron correlations, we find that the corrections from the Breit interaction and QED effects are important to get accurate results of NSD-PNC amplitudes in Cs. The largest cumulative contribution from the Breit and QED corrections is found to be $\approx$ 3.2\% of the total value. The upper bound on the theoretical uncertainty in our calculated NSD-PNC amplitudes is estimated to be about 1\%.

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of how ion mobility affects electron density and temperature in hypersonic flows. We compare two ion mobility models: one derived from Gupta-Yos cross-sections, and the other from swarm drift velocity experiments. The ion mobility model significantly alters the plasma density around a hypersonic waverider, with increases of more than twofold observed at low dynamic pressures and high Mach numbers. This is partly due to electron loss through surface catalysis, which depends on ambipolar diffusion scaling with ion mobility. We also derive novel scaling laws that highlight the strong dependence of electron cooling on ion mobility both within the quasi-neutral regions and the non-neutral plasma sheaths. Electron cooling influences the electron temperature across the plasma, leading to a previously unrecognized impact of ion mobility on plasma bulk temperature. This in turn affects plasma density via electron-ion recombination rates which are temperature-dependent. Accurately modeling ion mobility is critical for predicting hypersonic plasma behavior, with important implications for optimizing magnetohydrodynamic technologies and mitigating or exploiting plasma-induced interference with electromagnetic waves.

Abstract: Research on time crystals concerns the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in time, as well as the realization of phenomena and phases known from solid-state physics in the time domain. Periodically driven systems of massive particles are widely used in these studies. In the present work, we consider a photonic system and demonstrate that stable nonlinear propagation of a strong optical wave in a fiber leads to the establishment of quasi-periodic oscillations in the electromagnetic field intensity. A second, weaker signal optical wave propagating in the fiber senses these oscillations and, as a result, undergoes exponential localization in time. This is a temporal analogue of Aubry-Andre localization. If an optical detector is placed at a certain position in the fiber, the temporal localization of the probe wave will be observed in the form of the signal which emerges and then decays as a function of time.

Abstract: Numerical modeling of the interaction process of two counter-streaming supersonic plasma flows with an arched magnetic field configuration in the regime of a magnetic Mach number of the order of unity $M_m \sim 1$ is carried out. The flows were launched from the bases of the arch along the direction of the magnetic field. It is shown that the interaction has non-equilibrium and non-stationary nature. It is accompanied by an expansion of the resulting magnetic plasma arch due to $E \times B$ drift with the formation of a region with oppositely directed magnetic fields, in which magnetic reconnection is observed. In the subcritical regime Mm < 1 the reconnection process is slow, and in the overcritical one Mm > 1 it is more intense and leads to plasma turbulization. Filamentation of flows due to the development of Weibel instability, as well as excitation of surface waves near the ion-cyclotron frequency on the surface of the plasma tube are also observed. The modeling was carried out for the parameters of an experiment planned for the near future, which made it possible to formulate the conditions for observing the effects discovered in the modeling.

Abstract: We study the silicon vacancy in 3C SiC as a color center of interest in the field of Quantum Technologies, focusing on its magnetic interaction with the SiC nuclear spin bath containing Si29 and C13 nuclei in their natural isotopic concentration. We calculate the system energetic and magnetic properties with ab initio methods based on the Density Functional Theory, identifying the neutral charge state of the silicon vacancy as the most favorable for p doped 3C SiC systems. We thereon evaluate the Free Induction Decay and the Hahn echo sequence on the electron spin interacting with the nuclear spin bath. Here, the Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation phenomenon, due to single nuclear spin flipping processes, and the overall decay are highlighted in the context of the Cluster Correlation Expansion theory. We find a non exponential coherence decay, which is a typical feature of solid state qubits subjected to low frequency 1/f noise from the environment.

Abstract: We present a broad review of 1/f noise observations in the heliosphere, and discuss and complement the theoretical background of generic 1/f models as relevant to NASA's PUNCH mission. First observed in the voltage fluctuations of vacuum tubes, the scale-invariant 1/f spectrum has since been identified across a wide array of natural and artificial systems, including heart rate fluctuations and loudness patterns in musical compositions. In the solar wind, the interplanetary magnetic field trace spectrum exhibits 1/f scaling within the frequency range from around 2e-6 Hz to around 1e-3 Hz at 1 au. One compelling mechanism for the generation of 1/f noise is the superposition principle, where a composite 1/f spectrum arises from the superposition of a collection of individual power-law spectra characterized by a scale-invariant distribution of correlation times. In the context of the solar wind, such a superposition could originate from scale-invariant reconnection processes in the corona. Further observations have detected 1/f signatures in the photosphere and corona at frequency ranges compatible with those observed at 1 au, suggesting an even lower altitude origin of 1/f spectrum in the solar dynamo itself. This hypothesis is bolstered by dynamo experiments and simulations that indicate inverse cascade activities, which can be linked to successive flux tube reconnections beneath the corona, and are known to generate 1/f noise possibly through nonlocal interactions at the largest scales. Conversely, models positing in situ generation of $1/f$ signals face causality issues in explaining the low-frequency portion of the 1/f spectrum. Understanding 1/f noise in the solar wind may inform central problems in heliospheric physics, such as the solar dynamo, coronal heating, the origin of the solar wind, and the nature of interplanetary turbulence.

Abstract: The north-south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy's spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multi-directional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean-free-path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion-convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean-free-path length into $\le200$ GV rigidity region from $<10$ GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.

# Atomic Site Preference in the Quaternary Phase Eu2Mn1–xCd1+xPt2 (x = 0.11) with LaNiAl type structure

## 具有LaNiAl型结构的四相Eu2Mn1-xCd1 xPt2 (x = 0.11) 中的原子位置偏好

**Authors:** Anja-Verena, Mudring

After attempts to synthesize the imaginary ternary phase “EuMnPt” failed, the solid solutions EuMnxCd1–xPt were prepared following speculations that random mixing of the divalent Cd and Mn metals may be achieved in the previ-ously reported analogue EuCdPt (TiNiSi type, Pnma–c3). However, an unexpected atomic ordering resulted in the quater-nary phase Eu2Mn1–xCd1+xPt2 (x = 0.11) which adopts the Pd2(Mn,Pd)Ge2 (or LaNiAl, Pnma–c6) structure type instead, in which two mixed Mn/Cd sites in the structure show pronounced site preference, reminiscent to that of Mn/Pd sites in the prototype. Thus, the crystal structure of Eu2Cd1+xMn1–xPt2 (x = 0.11) represents a unique example of 4f-3d-4d-5d intermetallic system with nearly complete atomic ordering, and it may be best viewed as an intergrowth of hexagonal ZrNiAl type (previously reported for CeCdxMn1–xPt) and orthorhombic TiNiSi type (previously reported for YbCdxMn1–xPt). It is also the first Eu based compound to adopt the LaNiAl type structure, already reported only with the earlier lanthanides (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd), and all noble metals of the Pt group, but Os and Pt itself. The sublattice of paramagnetic Mn atoms consists of linear zigzag chains with Mn–Mn distance of 3.084(1) Å, while triangular magnetic geometrical frustration is realised in the Eu sublattice. Thus, the rather unexpected atomic segregation between two isovalent transition metals Mn (3d5) and Cd (4d10) may be ascribed, at first glance, to chemical bonding preference for homonuclear Mn–Mn over Cd–Cd and heteronuclear Mn–Cd interactions, in agreement with the 18–n rule.

## 超顺磁性聚乙二醇化零价铁金 (Fe0Au) 纳米粒子的合成与表征

Iron-gold (Fe0-Au) nanoparticles are forefront agents in biomedicine because of their magnetic and plasmonic properties and are prime candidates for advanced biomedical applications such as magnetic hyperthermia, targeted drug delivery, and bioimaging. Synthesizing biocompatible, stable iron phase, and minimal borate-related cytotoxicity, Fe0-Au hybrid nanoparticles are a great challenge, This study presents an optimized, two-step synthetic approach to produce PEGylated Fe0-Au hybrid nanoparticles, employing NaBH4 as a reducing agent under strictly anaerobic conditions. UV-Vis spectroscopy confirmed nanoparticle formation, with absorbance peaks at 260 nm for Fe0 and 526 nm for Au, accompanied by discernible color shifts in the colloidal suspension, indicative of successful metal reduction. High Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed a uniform spherical morphology with an average diameter of 50 nm, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated substantial minimization of borate byproducts, reducing these potentially cytotoxic residues to 14 atomic percent. Magnetization assessments showed hysteresis-free superparamagnetic behavior with a saturation magnetization of 75 Am&amp;sup2;/kg for the PEGylated NPs, validating their suitability for precision hyperthermia and magnetic resonance imaging. These findings indicate that PEG functionalization enhances colloidal stability and effectively mitigates toxicity risks, rendering these Fe0-Au nanoparticles as highly viable candidates for preclinical and potentially translational biomedical applications.

# The role of left atrio-ventricular coupling index and left atrial ejection fraction in predicting onset of atrial fibrillation and adverse cardiac events in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

## 左房室耦合指数和左心房射血分数在预测肥厚型心肌病心房颤动和不良心脏事件中的作用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5427795/latest

Background In recent years, several indexes have been proposed to predict atrial fibrillation (AF) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients, but with limited accuracy. This study aims to assess the role of new echocardiographic parameters in predicting AF onset. Additionally, the relationship of these parameters with major adverse cardiovascular outcomes (cardiovascular death and heart transplant) has been also investigated.Methods Clinical and imaging data from 141 patients with HCM and without history of AF have been retrospectively analyzed over 5 years period. Patients who developed AF during the study were compared to those who did not. Main parameters analyzed included end-diastolic left atrial volume (LAVmin), end-systolic volume (LAVmax), left atrial ejection fraction (LAEF), left atrioventricular coupling index (LACI), and left atrial diameter (LAD). The standardization of echocardiographic measurements has been assessed using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as a reference.Results Thirty-five patients developed AF at mean time of 4 years from the baseline evaluation. HCM-AF group had significantly higher values of LACI, LAD, and LAVmin. A LACI&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;43% on echocardiography, and LACI&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;44% on CMR showed the best performance in identifying patients who would develop AF. In a multivariate analysis, an echocardiographic LAEF&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;43% was independently associated with the occurences of AF (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4&amp;ndash;13.7). Eleven patients met the composite outcome of cardiovascular death or heart transplant; and a LACI&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;60% was associated with this outcome.Conclusion In HCM patients, both LACI and LAEF were significantly associated with the occurrence of AF over a 4 years period, demonstrating higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other tools. LACI&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;60% showed to be associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular death or heart transplant in HCM patients.

# Anisotropic Non-Fermi Liquid and Dynamical Planckian Scaling of a Quasi-Kagome Kondo Lattice System

## 准Kagome Kondo晶格系统的各向异性非费米液体和动态普朗克标度

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5436127/latest

At the quantum critical point between a magnetically ordered state and a correlated Fermi liquid state, a non-Fermi liquid state appears where electron correlations continuously develop to very low temperatures. The interacted electrons, namely quasiparticles, can be regarded as quantum entanglement where the relaxation time is scaled with the Planckian time, ℏ/kBT . However, there is a debate over whether heavy-fermion systems can obey the Planckian time. In the optical conductivity
spectra, the Planckian scale appears as the scaling of ℏ&omega;/kBT as the dynamical Planckian scaling (DPS). Here, we investigate the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the Drude response of a candidate for such materials, the quasi-kagome Kondo lattice CeRhSn, combining polarized optical conductivity measurements and first-principles band calculations. Even though the material shows a strong valence fluctuation, renormalized Drude responses observed at the photon energy below 100 meV are characterized by non-Fermi-liquid-like scattering rate 1/&tau;, which is far from other Ce-based heavy fermions. Additionally, the heavy carriers&rsquo; Drude response only for the Ce quasi-kagome plane obeyed DPS below 80 K, suggesting quantum criticality. These results suggest that the anisotropic quantum criticality with the strong c-f hybridization is realized in the Ce quasi-kagome lattice in CeRhSn.

# Predictive Value of Urethral Sphincter Complex Volume for Persistent High Voiding Pressure in Female Urethral Diverticulum Patients Post-Diverticulectomy

## 尿道括约肌复合体容积对女性尿道憩室术后持续高排尿压力的预测价值

Purpose This study evaluated the relationship between urethral diverticulum volume (UDv), urethral sphincter complex volume (USCv), clinical and urodynamic characteristics, and surgical outcomes in women with UD.Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 53 female patients who underwent diverticulectomy for UD. They were divided into two groups: proximal/middle UD (pmUD, n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;43) and distal UD (dUD, n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;10). Preoperative assessments included videourodynamic study (VUDS) and magnetic resonance imaging, with a follow-up VUDS 1 month post-surgery.Results Compared to the dUD group, pmUD patients were less likely to present with a vaginal lump (37.2% vs. 80.0%, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.031) but had significantly larger USCv (9.96&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;5.91 cm3 vs. 5.23&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.19 cm3, p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001) and UDv (6.27&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;7.40 cm3 vs. 0.84&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.81 cm3, p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001). The pmUD patients had longer surgeries and higher recurrence rates (32.6% vs. 0%, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.018). In the pmUD group, 24 patients had bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and 25 exhibited high-pressure voiding (&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;20cmH2O). No significant association was found between UDv or USCv and recurrence, unresolved BOO, or high-pressure voiding status. However, a USCv cutoff of &amp;ge;&amp;thinsp;8.2 cm3 was identified, predicting unresolved high-pressure voiding status post-surgery (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.023). Additionally, 9.3% pmUD patients developed de novo stress urinary incontinence, correlated with larger UDv (11.5&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;14.3 cm3 vs. 5.9&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;6.4 cm3, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.02).Conclusion A USCv cutoff of &amp;ge;&amp;thinsp;8.2 cm3 was identified as a predictor for unresolved high-pressure voiding after diverticulectomy.

## 肼与聚乙二醇化二氧化硅包覆的磁铁矿纳米颗粒的缀合作为pH响应性磁性纳米载体，用于阿霉素的共价负载和控制释放

Breast cancer is a major health issue among women, and doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used treatment. However, its clinical application is limited by its considerable toxicity. This study introduces an acidity-responsive magnetite nanoparticle-based nanocarrier for effective breast cancer treatment. The magnetite nanoparticles were initially coated with [3-(2,3-Epoxypropoxy)-propyl]-trimethoxysilane, an epoxysilane crosslinker, to enhance their stability and functional properties. Subsequently, NH2-PEG-COOH was conjugated to epoxy-functionalized silica-coated magnetite nanoparticles to improve biocompatibility and introduce reactive carboxyl groups. These carboxyl groups were further modified with hydrazine via carbodiimide-mediated amidation to construct magnetic nanocarriers (MNC). DOX was loaded into the system via acid-sensitive hydrazone bonds, resulting in the final MNC-DOX formulation. The DOX loading process followed the Ho-McKay model, demonstrating chemical adsorption kinetics with a high loading capacity of 433.147 mg/g. The acid-sensitive hydrazone bond facilitated rapid DOX release in response to the acidic tumor microenvironment, with release kinetics following the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, indicative of Fickian diffusion. In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that MNC-DOX exhibited significant cytotoxicity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells. This novel MNC-DOX formulation holds great potential for enhancing cancer therapy, highlighting its responsiveness to subtle pH changes and its ability to improve the targeted delivery and controlled release of chemotherapeutic agents.

# Physicochemical characteristics of lignins from corncob and agave tequila bagasse warrant their use for sustainable materials

## 来自玉米芯和龙舌兰龙舌兰酒甘蔗渣的木质素的理化特性保证了它们可用于可持续材料

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5357092/latest

Corncob and agave tequila bagasse are agricultural residues composed of lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses. Despite being the second most abundant biopolymer, commercial applications of lignin are restricted owed to its heterogeneous and complex chemical structure. However, lignin properties (UV-absorption, biodegradation, biocompatibility, antioxidant, etc.) forecast production of sustainable high-added value materials. The aim of this contribution was to characterize the material properties of organosolv lignins from corncobs (CC) and agave tequila bagasse (T), to aid in the development of sustainable materials. The physicochemical characteristics of both polymers were determined. The degree of polymerization was 16, determined by GPC for both residues, resulting in similar thermal properties (TGA and DSC). Infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies showed that T was composed mainly of syringyl (S) units, while CC contains p-hydroxyphenyl (H), syringyl (S), and guaiacyl (G) units. The surface composition as investigated by XPS, showed that T has more hydroxyl groups available on the surface and a higher surface area (12.2 m2/g) as compared to CC. Hydrodynamic size, determined by light scattering, ranged from 255&amp;ndash;712 nm for T, while CC particles had a wider distribution (from 70-1000 nm), with an 8-fold polydispersity index as compared with T; the z potential was in the vicinity of -30 mV for T and &amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;20 mV for CC. Spherical nanoparticles with diameters of 42 nm for T and 49 nm for CC were observed. Based upon the specific material properties of each lignin, sustainable, high value-added products can be obtained.

# Human Immunodeficiency Virus - Assocciated Hyperthropic Cardiomyopathy Presenting with Chest Pain Suspected with Acute Myocarditis: An Unusual Case Report

## 人类免疫缺陷病毒相关的多发性心肌病，表现为胸痛，怀疑患有急性心肌炎: 不寻常的病例报告

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5428463/latest

Background: Human Immunodeficiency Virus-associated cardiomyopathy (HIVAC) is a stage 4 disease that is linked to HIV and is still a major cause of illness and death in people who have HIV. The cause of HIVAC and how it shows up in the body depend on how weak the host's immune system is. Myocarditis caused by direct HIV toxicity, opportunistic diseases, and food deficiencies may be a cause of HIVAC. We describe a woman with a low CD4 count who had severe dilated cardiomyopathy caused by HIV.
Case Presentation: A 40-year-old female with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy presented with severe chest pain that began two hours before hospital admission. Complaints were linked to perspiration and shortness of breath. The vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg, a heart rate of 85 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 25 brpm. The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with anteroseptal old myocardial infarction, while echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy, a 77% ejection fraction, septal thickening with asynergic ventricular regions in the inferolateral area, and a suspicion of myocarditis. The CD4 count at admission was reduced to 144 cells/mm3, and the high sensitivity troponin level was increased. She initiated inotropic and vasopressor therapy, a maintenance protocol of dual antiplatelet medicines, anticoagulants, heart failure care, and steroid treatment. After five days of therapy, the patient's symptoms improved, and a referral for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was arranged to validate the diagnosis of acute myocarditis.
Conclusion: This instance underscores the significance of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sustaining adequate CD4 counts and suppressing elevated viral loads to avert opportunistic infections, perhaps serving as a crucial factor in HIVAC.

# Wireless Power Reception System Based on Metasurface Lens for Compact Unmanned Mobilities

## 基于超表面透镜的紧凑型无人机动无线功率接收系统

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3511098/latest

In this paper, a wireless power reception system is proposed for compact unmanned mobilities. It comprises an electromagnetic (EM) wave focusing metasurface lens integrated patch antenna for improved EM wave reception and a complementary metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit rectifier to convert received millimetre waves to DC power source. Dynamic wireless power reception could be stably realised by exploiting the polarisation independency and wider incident angle characteristics, even when a misalignment occurs between the transmitter and receiver antennas. Compared to the conventional patch array antenna structure, the main radiation pattern of the proposed metasurface structure shows noticeably wider angular coverages for both E- and H- planes, confirming the wider wireless power receiving capability even for oblique incident waves. Finally, to demonstrate the wireless power transfer capability of the proposed system, the metasurface based wireless power reception IC system is implemented on a miniaturised actuator system based on ionic elastomer mimicking a locomotive &ldquo;bug&rdquo;, confirming that the proposed concept holds promise potentially for a full-scale, high power, longer range operation for powering small, unmanned vehicles.

# &nbsp; Realistic finite temperature simulations for magnetic and transport properties of ferromagnet &nbsp;

## 铁磁体的磁性和输运性质的现实有限温度模拟

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5495560/latest

Accurately modeling the magnetic and transport properties of ferromagnetic materials at finite temperatures remains a significant challenge in materials science. In this study, we present a comprehensive simulation approach that combines first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo simulations to investigate body-centered cubic (bcc) iron (Fe). We calculate the magnetic exchange coupling constants (Jij) while incorporating thermal lattice vibrations effects, achieving a more realistic temperature-dependent behavior of Jij and the Curie temperature of bcc Fe. Our Monte Carlo simulations employ the classical Heisenberg model enhanced with a quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation, wherein thermal spin fluctuations effects of magnons obey Bose-Einstein statistics. This approach successfully reproduces the spontaneous magnetization curve across a wide temperature range. Our method addresses well-known discrepancies in spontaneous magnetization between the ordinary classical Heisenberg model and experimental results, particularly in the low-temperature regime where spontaneous magnetization follows Bloch&rsquo;s 3/2 power law in experimental data. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach accurately reproduces the electrical resistivity and specific heat of bcc Fe, whereas the ordinary classical Heisenberg model fails to capture these temperature-dependent properties. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both thermal lattice vibrations and thermal spin fluctuations effects with Bose-Einstein statistics when modeling ferromagnetic materials, thus enabling more precise predictions of magnetic and transport properties at finite temperatures.

# A superconducting metamaterials transmission line resonator: experimental verification of the non-uniform mode spacing

## 超导超材料传输线谐振器: 非均匀模式间隔的实验验证

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5149330/latest

Superconducting transmission line resonators (TLRs) have been widely applied to circuit quantum electrodynamical systems for superconducting quantum computation and single-photon detections. Recently, such a right-handed TLR has been generalized to electromagnetic metamaterials (MTMs), and its unconventional mode structure has been experimentally characterized [H. Wang et al., Phys. Rev. Applied 11, 054062 (2019)]. Here, we demonstrate another kind of MTM TLR, a superconducting quarter-wavelength composite right/left-handed (CRLH) TLR composed of lumped-elements. We design the devices and analyze their transport properties by developing a real-space approach, wherein the physical parameters at the device boundaries are utilized conveniently. Superconducting MTM TLRs with typical three unit cells were experimentally prepared by etching a superconducting aluminum film on a SiO2 substrate, and their microwave transport properties were measured at low temperatures of 50mK. The results show that the modes spacing in such a quarter-wavelength CRLH-TLR is non-uniform due to the nonlinear dispersion relation. This implies that they could be utilized to encode the superconducting qubits, analogously to the usual ones encoded by the Josephson devices.
