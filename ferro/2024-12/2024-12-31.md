Abstract: An ansatz applied to the two-dimensional Ising model in an external magnetic field h gives rise to an exactly soluble model. The singularity in the magnetization found by Onsager does not survive the presence of the external magnetic field as found earlier by Lee and Yang in 1952. However, the singularity in the heat capacity remains even in the presence of the magnetic field. A surprising result is the presence of negative heat capacity for h > 0.

arXiv:2412.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnon heat transport in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator containing a domain wall (DW) in the presence of a magnetic field applied along the easy axis. We show that the intrinsic spin of the DW couples to the external magnetic field which modifies the transmission of spin wave (SW) through the DW. Applying the magnetic field lifts the degeneracy between two AFM magnon modes and results in different occupation numbers for the two magnon modes. Combined with the finite reflection of a narrow domain wall, this is found to have a significant impact on the magnon heat transport, giving rise to thermal magnetoresistance. Our findings suggest that an AFM DW can be used as a controllable element for regulating the magnon heat current in magnonic devices through the application of a magnetic field.

Abstract: Topological polar textures in ferroelectrics have attracted significant interest for their potential for energy-efficient and high-density data storage and processing. Among these, polar merons and antimerons are predicted in strained and twisted bilayers of inversion symmetry broken systems. However, experimental observation of these polar textures within twisted two-dimensional van der Waals (2D vdW) materials remains challenging. Here, we utilize vector piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to reconstruct the polarization fields in R-type marginally twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We observe alternating out-of-plane (OOP) polarizations at domain regions and in-plane (IP) vortex-like polarization patterns along domain walls (DWs), indicative of a network of polar merons and antimerons. Notably, the OOP polarization exhibits three polarity reversals across a DW. Similar polar textures are identified in marginally twisted MoSe2 and WSe2 homobilayers. Our theoretical simulations attribute these unusual polarization reversals near the DWs to the competition between moir\'e ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. These results provide experimental evidence of complex polar textures in moir\'e ferroelectrics, offering new insights into the electronic band topology in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).

arXiv:2412.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron correlation often gives birth to various orders in quantum materials. Recently, a strongly correlated kagome antiferromagnet FeGe is discovered to undergo a charge density wave transition inside the A-type antiferromagnetic state, providing an opportunity to explore the interplay between charge order and magnetism. Here, we reported the observation of anisotropic resistivity and Hall effect, along with a topological Hall effect, in the annealed FeGe crystals. As the current flows along the \emph{ab}-plane, the temperature dependence of $\rho_{ab}$ exhibits a distinct resistivity loop related to a first-order transition at $T_{cdw}$. The applied magnetic fields do not alter $T_{cdw}$ but can induce a spin-flop transition at $H_{sf}$. Consequently, a field-induced large topological Hall effect is observed in the canting antiferromagnetic (CAFM) state below $T_{cant}$, which is possibly attributed to the non-trivial spin texture during the spin-flop process. Whereas, as current is parallel to \emph{c}-axis, both the field-induced transitions in $\rho_{c}$ and $\chi_{c}$ disappear. Instead, the Hall resistivity in the annealed FeGe significantly exhibits a deviation from the linear field-dependent. These findings provide valuable insight into revealing the interplay among magnetism, charge order and topology in the kagome magnets.

arXiv:2412.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For molecules and solids, we developed efficient MPI-parallel algorithms for evaluating the second-order exchange term with bare, statically screened, and dynamically screened interactions. We employ the resulting term in a fully self-consistent manner together with scGW, resulting in the following vertex-corrected scGW schemes: scGWSOX, scGWSOSEX, scGW2SOSEX, and scG3W2theories. We show that for the vertex evaluation, the reduction of scaling by tensor hypercontraction (THC) has two limiting execution regimes. We used the resulting code to perform the largest (by the number of orbitals) fully self-consistent calculations with the SOX term. We demonstrate that our procedure allows for a reliable evaluation of even small energy differences. Utilizing a broken-symmetry approach, we explore the influence of the SOX term on the effective magnetic exchange couplings. We show that the treatment of SOX has a significant impact on the obtained values of the effective exchange constants, which we explain through a self-energy dependence on an effective dielectric constant. We confirm this explanation by analyzing natural orbitals and local changes in charge transfer quantifying superexchange. Our analysis explains the structure of weak electron correlation responsible for the modulation of superexchange in both molecules and solids. Finally, for solids, we evaluate Neel temperatures utilizing the high-temperature expansion and compare the results obtained with experimental measurements.

Abstract: Hybrid systems consisting of multiple materials with distinct physical properties and tunable interactions provide a promising route for fulfilling transformative quantum innovations. Solid-state spin qubits and superconducting circuits stand out as leading candidates in this context due to their complementary device performance and quantum mechanical properties. Here, we report experimental integration of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spin qubit and an on-chip superconducting resonator for realizing multimodal quantum applications. Specifically, we have observed superconductivity enhanced NV spin relaxation, which shows a similar Hebel-Slichter peak feature around the phase transition point. In the coherent interaction regime, we show that the superconducting resonator mode is capable of exciting NV Rabi oscillations. Taking advantage of scanning NV magnetometry, we further visualized microscopic electromagnetic behaviors of the superconducting resonator, revealing the formation and evolution of superconducting vortices at the nanoscale. Our results highlight the potential of harnessing NV centers and superconducting circuits for designing hybrid systems to advance the burgeoning quantum revolution. The current study will also open a new pathway to test and evaluate miniaturized superconducting electronics for their future design and performance improvements.

Abstract: Spin current plays a central role in spintronics for driving exotic spin-dependent phenomena and high-performance device applications. Recently, a magnetic spin Hall effect has been discovered in spin-split antiferromagnets including noncollinear antiferromagnets and altermagnets, allowing the efficient generation of unconventional spin currents even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. However, although such nonrelativistic spin currents are proposed to have a magnetic origin, the direct connection between the Neel vector and the spin current polarization is still missing. Here, using the altermagnetic RuO2 as a representative example, we unveil the spin current polarization by disentangling the conventional and magnetic spin Hall effects using a technique we developed based on the spin Hall magnetoresistance measurement. The results suggest that the nonrelativistic spin current hosts a polarization very close to the Neel vector. Our work offers unambiguous evidence of the magnetic origin of the nonrelativistic spin current in altermagnetic RuO2, and paves a straightforward route to understand the unconventional spin currents that are crucial in spintronics.

Abstract: Ferroelectricity has been one major focus in modern fundamental research and technological application. We consider the physical origin of improper ferroelectricity in Mott insulating materials. Beyond the well-known Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky's inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism for the noncollinearly ordered magnets, we point out the induction of the electric polarizations in the multipolar ordered Mott insulators. Using the multiflavor representation for the multipolar magnetic moments, we can show the crossover or transition from the pure inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism to the pure multipolar origin for the ferroelectricity, and also incorporate the intermediate regime with the mixture of both origins. We expect our results to inspire the reexamination of the ferroelectricity among the multipolar-ordered magnets.

Abstract: Nanoscale confinement of molecules in a fluid can result in enhanced viscosity, local fluidic order, or collective motion. Confinement also affects ion transport and/or the rate and equilibrium concentration in a chemical reaction, all of which makes it the subject of broad interest. Studying these effects, however, is notoriously difficult, mainly due to the lack of experimental methods with the required sensitivity and spatial or time resolution. Here we leverage shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the dynamics of room-temperature water molecules entrapped within ~6-nm-tall channels formed between the diamond crystal and a suspended hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake. NV-enabled nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of confined water protons reveal a much reduced H2O self-diffusivity, orders of magnitude lower than in bulk water. We posit the slow dynamics stem from the accumulation of photogenerated carriers at the interface and trapped fluid, a notion we support with the help of molecular dynamics modeling. Our results provide feedback for theories describing interfacial water, and lay out a route for investigating other fluids under confinement.

arXiv:2412.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization flutter, produced by an applied AC electric field drives an equilibrium ferroelectric nematic ($\mathrm{N_F}$) liquid crystal (LC) through a transition into a dissipative active ferroelectric nematic state exhibiting strong elasto-hydrodynamic intermolecular interaction. In such a fluttering ferroelectric, the typical equilibrium $\mathrm{N_F}$ textural features adopted to reduce electrostatic energy, such as preferences for director bend, and alignment of polarization parallel to LC/air interfaces, are overcome, giving way to nonequilibrium conjugate structures in which director splay, and alignment of polarization normal to $\mathrm{N_F}$/air interfaces are preferred. Viewing the latter textures as those of an active nematic phase reveals that self-organization to reduce effective viscosity and resulting dissipation generates a flow-driven apparent nematic elasticity and interface structuring that dominates equilibrium LC elastic and surface forces.

Abstract: Half-metals are a class of quantum materials with 100% spin-polarization at the Fermi level and have attracted a lot of attention for future spintronic device applications. CrO2 is one of the most promising half-metal candidates, for which the electrical and magnetic properties have been intensively studied in the last several decades. Here, we report the observation of a giant anisotropy (~1600%) of effective Gilbert damping in the single crystalline half metallic (100)-CrO2 thin films, which is significantly larger than the values observed on conventional ferromagnetic Fe and CoFe thin films. Furthermore, the effective Gilbert damping exhibits opposite temperature-dependent behaviors below 50 K with magnetic field along [010] direction and near [001] direction. These experimental results suggest the strong spin-orbit coupling anisotropy of the half-metallic CrO2 and might pave the way for future magnonic computing applications.

# Towards structural softness and enhanced electromechanical responses in HfO2 ferroelectrics

**Authors:** Binayak Mukherjee, Natalya S. Fedorova, Jorge \'I\~niguez-Gonz\'alez

arXiv:2412.19093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural softness - often characterized by unstable phonon modes and large electromechanical responses - is a hallmark of ferroelectric perovskites like BaTiO3 or Pb(Ti,Zr)O3. Whether HfO2 ferroelectrics present any such structural softness is still a matter of debate. Here, using first principles calculations, we predict that it is possible to induce structural instabilities in hafnia. More specifically, our calculations show that in-plane epitaxial tensile strain causes a mechanical instability of the ferroelectric phase, which transforms discontinuously into an antipolar polymorph. Then, upon release of the tensile strain, the antipolar polymorph transforms back to the ferroelectric state by a soft phonon instability. We show that the softening is accompanied by enhancements in the dielectric and piezoelectric responses. While these transitions occur at high epitaxial strains for pure ferroelectric HfO2, we show that the required deformations are considerably lowered in superlattices with other simple oxides, which may facilitate realizing these effects experimentally.

# Discovery of an Ultra-Stable Antiferromagnetic Two-Dimensional CrF3 Phase with Anisotropic Quasi-1D Mechanical, Electronic, and Thermal Properties

arXiv:2412.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.

Abstract: Strategies such as chemical substitution, strain engineering and van der Waals stacking offer powerful means to control magnetism in 2D materials, enabling the emergence of novel quantum phenomena. Here, we investigate the magnetic properties of bulk CrSBr$_{1-x}$Cl$_x$ ($x = 0{-}1$) and the strain-dependent switchable magnetic phases in bilayers CrSBr, CrSCl, and CrSBr/CrSCl heterostructures, using firstprinciples calculations. Our findings demonstrate that Cl incorporation in CrSBr induces competing interlayer antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic couplings, leading to a spin-glass state when the Cl content exceeds a 67%. This is accompanied by a decrease of magnetic anisotropy, where a $XY$-type magnetic ground state is observed in pristine CrSCl. For CrSBr and CrSCl bilayers, we report a reversible strain-induced switching between interlayer antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic configurations. Furthermore, we reveal the emergence of interfacial ferromagnetism in CrSBr/CrSCl heterostructures, stabilizing an in-plane magnetization axis for CrSCl by proximity to CrSBr. These results underscore the potential of manipulating magnetism in 2D magnetic materials through precise control of magnetic phases.

By analyzing a tight-binding model in a two-dimensional tetragonal system, we show that the $g$-wave altermagnets give rise to the nonlinear piezomagnetic effect, where a net magnetization is induced by the second-order strain. We compare the results for the $g$-wave altermagnets with those for the $d$-wave altermagnets, where the linear piezomagnetic effect occurs. As a result, we find that the induced magnetization is enhanced when the Fermi level lies on the band with the large spin splitting in both cases. We also show that the magnitudes of the induced magnetization are comparable to each other. Our results indicate that the nonlinear piezomagnetic effect is a good phenomenon to characterize the physical properties in $g$-wave altermagnets.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the physical properties of intermetallic ErPd$_2$Si$_2$, a compound renowned for its intriguing magnetic and electronic characteristics. We confirm the tetragonal crystal structure of ErPd$_2$Si$_2$ within the $I4/mmm$ space group. Notably, we observed anisotropic thermal expansion, with the lattice constant $a$ expanding and $c$ contracting between 15 K and 300 K. This behavior is attributed to lattice vibrations and electronic contributions. Heat capacity measurements revealed three distinct temperature regimes: $T_1 \sim 3.0$ K, $T_\textrm{N} \sim 4.20$ K, and $T_2 \sim 15.31$ K. These correspond to the disappearance of spin-density waves, the onset of an incommensurate antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure, and the crystal-field splitting and/or the presence of short-range spin fluctuations, respectively. Remarkably, the AFM phase transition anomaly was observed exclusively in low-field magnetization data (120 Oe) at $T_\textrm{N}$. A high magnetic field ($B =$ 3 T) effectively suppressed this anomaly, likely due to spin-flop and spin-flip transitions. Furthermore, the extracted effective PM moments closely matched the expected theoretical value, suggesting a dominant magnetic contribution from localized 4$f$ spins of Er. Additionally, significant differences in resistance ($R$) values at low temperatures under applied $B$ indicated a magnetoresistance (MR) effect with a minimum value of -4.36\%. Notably, the measured MR effect exhibited anisotropic behavior, where changes in the strength or direction of the applied $B$ induced variations in the MR effect. A twofold symmetry of $R$ was discerned at 3 T and 9 T, originating from the orientation of spin moments relative to the applied $B$. Intriguingly, above $T_\textrm{N}$, short-range spin fluctuations also displayed a preferred orientation along the $c$-axis due to single-ion anisotropy.

Abstract: Magnons, the quanta of spin angular momentum, can be excited in magnetic insulators by spin-flip scattering processes originated from currents applied to a heavy metal overlayer. The efficiency to generate non-equilibrium magnons across interfaces is parametrized by the spin conductance gs, a phenomenological constant that is considered to be dependent on thermal magnons. Here, we investigate non-linear magnetoresistance phenomena originated in Pt due to current-driven nonequilibrium magnons in Y3Fe5O12 (YIG). Remarkably, we find that spin-flip scattering processes are dominated by subthermal magnons at room temperature, resulting in a large modulation of gs with the magnetic field and YIG thickness. Concretely, we find that decreasing the YIG thickness from 100 to 10 nm increases gs by a factor 30 and observe that the magnetic field exponentially suppresses the magnon generation efficiency. These findings challenge current understanding on gs and indicate that electrically-driven magnonic effects such as damping compensation and magnon condensation can be largely boosted by device miniaturization.

Abstract: Following the concept of creating individual centers, we investigate local electronic states and magnetic ordering in nickel oxide (NiO) induced by substituting oxygen (O) with nitrogen (N). Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design could potentially advance quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-qubits.

Abstract: The transient negative capacitance (NC) of solid ferroelectric materials used in field effect transistors can reduce the power dissipation of electronics. Here we show that similar negative capacitance appears in the recently discovered fluid ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (FNLC) films while switching their ferroelectric polarization. Instead of sidewise motion of domains with opposite direction of polarization of ferroelectric crystals, in FNLCs the polarization vector that at zero field aligns parallel to the substrates, rotates toward the applied electric field. In spite of that difference, the observed switching time per unit electric field values are comparable. Although current FNLCs have much larger electric conductivity than of ferroelectric crystals, they have several advantages: they are organic, lightweight, can be prepared and operated at ambient temperature, the direction of the polarization can be set by simple surface alignment, and they require much less electric field for switching of the polarization. These properties make FNLCs attractive to test them in in flexible organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) devices.

Abstract: Mechanical stress produced in nano- and micro-scale structures can enhance materials properties, such as the high mobility of silicon in modern transistors or amplified magnetization dynamics in spintronic devices. Here, we report on the dynamics of coherent acoustic phonons excited by femtosecond light pulses and confined in a single freestanding nickel layer, acting as an acoustic cavity. By combining Fourier transform analysis of the experimental signal and numerical multi-physics simulations, we show that high-frequency (> 10 GHz) longitudinal acoustic pulses can resonate inside the cavity and display lower damping compared to a reference nickel film on SiO2 substrate given that the conditions of total reflection are nearly met in the cavity. Our results provide a thorough understanding of the opto-acoustic response in suspended membranes of magnetic materials, which we foresee can be used to amplify magnetization precession dynamics and to develop magneto-acousto-optical modulators.

Abstract: Superconducting permanent magnets (SCs) with trapped magnetic flux are used in technical devices (motors, generators, etc.). These magnets endure repeated magnetic "shocks" during operation, which can affect their performance. In this work, we investigated the dynamic behavior of magnetic induction in the trapped flux in an SC disk when exposed to stepwise changes in the external magnetic field, simulating these operational shocks. Our results reveal a direct correlation between the stepwise changes in the magnetic field and the trapped flux response, with each increase or decrease in the field inducing a corresponding 40-50% change in trapped flux for a 600 G field step at temperature of 5 K. The magnitude of these changes depends on the external parameters and their dynamics could lead to additional energy dissipation and potential heating, which may affect the reliability of SC magnets in applications. A scaling analysis of the induction flux profiles, revealing roughness exponents in the range of 0.435 to 0.475 was performed as well, and we determined the Hausdorff dimension of the surface structure.

Abstract: We study the orbital magnetic susceptibility of tilted massless Dirac fermions in two dimensions. It is well-known that the type-I massless Dirac fermions exhibit divergingly-large diamagnetic susceptibility, whereas less is known about the types II and III cases. We first clarify that the orbital magnetic susceptibility is vanishing for the types II and III in the continuum model. We then compare the three types of Dirac fermions for the lattice models. We employ three tight-binding models with different numbers of Dirac points, all of which are two-band models defined on a square lattice. For all three models, we find that the type-I Dirac fermions show the divergingly-large orbital diamagnetic susceptibility, whereas the type-II Dirac fermions exhibit non-diverging paramagnetic susceptibility. The type-III Dirac fermions exhibit diamagnetism but its susceptibility is small compared with the type-I case.

Abstract: Quantum computation based on superconducting circuits utilizes superconducting qubits with Josephson tunnel junctions. Engineering high-coherence qubits requires materials optimization. In this work, we present two superconducting thin film systems, grown on silicon (Si), and one obtained from the other via annealing. Cobalt (Co) thin films grown on Si were found to be superconducting [EPL 131 (2020) 47001]. These films also happen to be a self-organised hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (S/F/S) structure. The S/F/S hybrids are important for superconducting $\pi$-qubits [PRL 95 (2005) 097001] and in quantum information processing. Here we present our results on the superconductivity of a hybrid Co film followed by the superconductivity of a CoSi$_2$ film, which was prepared by annealing the Co film. CoSi$_2$, with its $1/f$ noise about three orders of magnitude smaller compared to the most commonly used superconductor aluminium (Al), is a promising material for high-coherence qubits. The hybrid Co film revealed superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ = 5 K and anisotropy in the upper critical field between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The anisotropy was of the order of ratio of lateral dimensions to thickness of the superconducting Co grains, suggesting a quasi-2D nature of superconductivity. On the other hand, CoSi$_2$ film showed a $T_c$ of 900 mK. In the resistivity vs. temperature curve, we observe a peak near $T_c$. Magnetic field scan as a function of $T$ shows a monotonic increase in intensity of this peak with temperature. The origin of the peak has been explained in terms of parallel resistive model for the particular measurement configuration. Although our CoSi$_2$ film contains grain boundaries, we observed a perpendicular critical field of 15 mT and a critical current density of 3.8x10$^7$ A/m$^2$, comparable with epitaxial CoSi$_2$ films.

Abstract: Development of quantum materials and tailoring of their functional properties is a fundamental interest in materials science. Here we propose a new design concept for robust quantum anomalous Hall effect via entropy engineering in 2D magnets. As a prototypical example, configurational entropy of monolayer transition metal trihalide VCl$_3$ is manipulated by incorporating four different transition-metal cations [Ti,Cr,Fe,Co] in the honeycomb structure made of vanadium, such that all the in-plane mirror symmetries, inversion and/or roto-inversion are broken. Monolayer VCl$_3$ is a ferromagnetic Dirac half-metal in which spin-polarized Dirac dispersion at valley momenta is accompanied by bulk states at the $\Gamma$-point and thus the spin-orbit interaction driven quantum anomalous Hall phase does not exhibit fully gapped bulk band dispersion. Entropy-driven bandstructure renormalization, especially band flattening in combination with red and blue shifts at different momenta of the Brillouin zone and crystal-field effects, transforms Dirac half-metal to a Dirac spin gapless semiconductor and leads to a robust quantum anomalous Hall phase with fully gapped bulk band dispersion, and thus, a purely topological edge state transport without mixing with dissipative bulk channels. These findings provide a paradigm to design entropy-driven 2D materials for the realization of robust quantum anomalous Hall effect and quantum device applications.

Abstract: We present a fully analytical model of hybridization between magnon, and phonons observed experimentally in magneto-Raman scattering in van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (AFM). Here, the representative material, FePS3, has been shown to be a quasi-two-dimensional-Ising antiferromagnet, with additional features of spin-phonon coupling in the Raman spectra emerging below the N\'eel temperature (TN) of approximately 120 K. Using magneto-Raman spectroscopy as an optical probe of magnetic structure, we show that one of these Raman-active modes in the magnetically ordered state is a magnon with a frequency of 3.7 THz (~ 122 cm-1). In addition, one magnon band and three phonon bands are coupled via the magneto-elastic coupling evidenced by anti-crossing in the complete spectra. We consider a simple model involving only in-plane nearest neighbor exchange couplings (designed to give rise to a similar magnetic structure) and perpendicular anisotropy in presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field. Exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian leads to energy bands which show that the interaction term gives rise to avoided crossings between the hybridized magnon and phonon branches. Realizing magnon-phonon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) AFMs is important for the verification of the theoretical predictions on exotic quantum transport phenomena like spin-caloritronics, topological magnonics, etc.

Abstract: Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.

Abstract: In light of recent advancements in energy technology, there is an urgent need for lead-free barium titanate (BTO) -based materials that exhibit remarkable ferroelectric and photoelectric properties. Notwithstanding the considerable experimental advances, a theoretical understanding from the electron and atomic perspectives remains elusive. This study employs the generalized gradient approximation plane wave pseudopotential technique to investigate the structural, electronic, ferroelectric, and optical properties of (Zn,Co) co-doped BaTiO3 (BZCT) based on density functional theory. The objective is to ascertain the extent of performance enhancement and the underlying mechanism of (Zn,Co) co-doping on barium titanate. Our findings reveal that incorporating (Zn,Co) into the BaTiO3 lattice significantly augments the tetragonality of the unit cell. Moreover, the ferroelectric properties are enhanced, with a spontaneous polarization stronger than that observed in pure BTO, exhibiting excellent ferroelectricity. The results of the Hubbard+U algorithm indicate that the band gap of BZCT is reduced. Concurrently, the enhanced ferroelectric polarization increases the built-in electric field of the material, facilitating the separation of photogenerated carriers and improving optical absorption. Consequently, the optical absorption ability and photorefractive ability are effectively enhanced. BZCT, with its high spontaneous polarization and outstanding optical properties, can be a promising candidate material in energy storage and photovoltaics.

Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.

Abstract: We use a combination of ultra-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering and Monte Carlo numerical simulations to study the thermodynamics and the structure of spin excitations in the spin-supersolid phase of the triangular lattice XXZ easy axis antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ and its evolution in a magnetic field. BKT transitions heralding the onset of Ising and supersolid order are detected. Above the supersolid phase the value of Wannier entropy is experimentally recovered. At low temperatures, with an experimental resolution of about 23 $\mu$eV, no discrete coherent magnon modes are resolved within a broad continuum of scattering. In addition to gapless excitations, a pseudo-Goldstone mode with a small energy gap of 0.06 meV is found. A second excitation continuum is seen at higher energy, in place of single-spin-flip excitations of the Ising model. In applied fields the continuum gradually morphs into coherent spin waves, with the Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone sectors showing distinct evolution. The agreement between experiment and numerical simulations is excellent on the quantitative level.

Abstract: Recently, there is an increasing renewed interest in 2D magnetism such as Van der Waals magnets. The physics of 2D magnetism and ultra-thin magnetic films has a long history. This chapter is a review devoted to some fundamental theoretical properties of 2D magnets and and magnetic thin films including frustrated systems and topological spin textures. These properties allow to understand macroscopic behaviors experimentally observed in thin films and superlattices where the surface and the interface play a crucial role. The chapter begins with a review on 2D magnets, their spin structures and phase transitions. Next, the case of thin films is considered. The theory of surface spin waves is discussed in various situations with and without surface reconstruction of spin ordering. Various interactions are taken into account: surface interaction different from the bulk one, competing interactions, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Surface phase transitions are shown in some particularly striking cases. Finally, some cases of topological spin textures called "skyrmions" are reviewed. All the results shown in this chapter have been published in various research papers cited in the text. Therefore, we will discuss some important results but avoid to enter complicated methods. Instead, the reader is referred to original papers for detailed demonstrations.

Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) arise from the bounds on fluctuations of thermodynamics quantities during a non-equilibrium process and they impose constraints on the corresponding process. We experimentally implement a quantum SWAP engine on a nuclear magnetic resonance setup and demonstrate that a Gibbs thermal state can be prepared in two different ways, either directly from a thermal equilibrium state, or by first initializing the system in a pseudopure state. We show that the quantum SWAP engine can work both as a heat engine and as a refrigerator. Starting from a pseudopure state, we construct the SWAP engine, and investigate the violation of two different TURs, namely a generalized TUR and a tighter, more specific TUR. Our results validate that the generalized TUR is obeyed in all the working regimes of the SWAP engine, while the tighter TUR is violated in certain regimes. ~

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermal quantum correlations in a semiconductor double quantum dot system. The device comprises a single electron in a double quantum dot subjected to a longitudinal magnetic field and a transverse magnetic field gradient. The thermal entanglement of the single electron is driven by the charge and spin qubits. Utilizing the density matrix formalism, we derive analytical expressions for thermal concurrence and correlated coherence. The main goal of this work is to provide a good understanding of the effects of temperature and various parameters on quantum coherence. Additionally, our findings indicate that the transverse magnetic field can be employed to adjust the thermal entanglement and quantum coherence of the system. We also highlight the roles of thermal entanglement and correlated coherence in generating quantum correlations, noting that thermal correlated coherence is consistently more robust than thermal entanglement. This suggests that quantum algorithms based solely on correlated coherence might be more resilient than those relying on entanglement.

Abstract: The practical difficulty in distinguishing the impact of magnetic circular dichroism and the inverse Faraday effect fuels intense debates over which mechanism predominantly drives the process of helicity dependent all-optical switching of magnetization in ferromagnets. Here, we quantitatively measure the efficiency of the switching process in a Pt/Co/Pt multilayered stack using visible- to near-infrared optical pulses. We find that the switching efficiency increases by a factor of 8.6 upon increasing the pumping wavelength from 0.5 $ \mu $m to 1.1 $ \mu $m, becoming 100 % efficient at even longer wavelengths up to 2.0 $ \mu $m. Our experimental results can be successfully explained by the phenomenon of magnetic circular dichroism, making a significant step towards resolving the long-standing controversy over the origin of the all-optical process of magnetization reversal in ferromagnets.

Abstract: We compute the transmission coefficients and zero-temperature conductance for chiral quasiparticles propagating through various geometries, which consist of junctions of three-dimensional nodal-point semimetals. In the first scenario, we consider a potential step with two Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl or two birefringent semimetals, which are tilted with respect to the other on the two sides of the junction. The second set-up consists of a junction between a doped Dirac semimetal and a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal, where an intrinsic magnetization present in the latter splits the doubly-degenerate Dirac node into a pair of Weyl nodes. A scalar potential is also applied in the region where the Weyl semimetal phase exists. Finally, we study sandwiches of Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals, with the middle region being subjected to both scalar and vector potentials. Our results show that a nonzero transmission spectrum exists where the areas, enclosed by the Fermi surface projections (in the plane perpendicular to the propagation axis) of the incidence and transmission regions, overlap. Such features can help engineer unidirectional carrier propagation, topologically protected against impurity backscattering, because of the chiral nature of the charge carriers.

Abstract: In this review, the thermoelectric properties in nodal-point semimetals with two bands are discussed. For the two-dimensional (2D) cases, it is shown that the expressions of the thermoelectric coefficients take different values depending on the nature of the scattering mechanism responsible for transport, by considering examples of short-ranged disorder potential and screened charged impurities. An anisotropy in the energy dispersion spectrum invariably affects the thermopower quite significantly, as illustrated by the results for a node of semi-Dirac semimetal and a single valley of graphene. The scenario when a magnetic field of magnitude $B$ is applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2D semimetal is also considered. The computations for three-dimensional (3D) cases necessarily involve the inclusion of nontrivial Berry phase effects. In addition to demonstrating the expressions for the response tensors, the exotic behaviour observed in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups is also discussed.

Abstract: Despite the presence of the exact solution and well-established recipe for its realization, the quest for the Kitaev spin liquid in real materials remains exceptionally challenging. Among many magnets, $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ emerges as a prime candidate, albeit the hallmarks of the spin liquid manifest only within the specific region where the zigzag-type antiferromagnetic order is suppressed by an applied magnetic field. Here, we propose the possible realization of the Kitaev spin liquid at zero field by making van der Waals heterostructures of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and a ferromagnet Cr$X_3$ ($X$=Cl and I). Using {\it ab initio} calculations, we find that in the case of $X$=Cl the zigzag order is suppressed by the proximity effect of the ferromagnetic CrCl$_3$ layer, while the Kitaev interaction is still relevant in the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ layer. Notably, the induced Ru moment is close to the value observed in the spin liquid region of the bulk material, signifying the possibility of the Kitaev spin liquid at zero field. In contrast, in the case of $X$=I, the system is on the verge of an insulator-metal transition by carrier doping through interlayer hybridization. Our results indicate that van der Waals heterostructures provide a new platform for studying not only magnetic but also electronic properties of the Kitaev magnets.

Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) have recently attracted attention in the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics because of their various interesting properties. Due to the noncollinear magnetic order, the localized electron spins on different magnetic sublattices are not conserved even when spin-orbit coupling is neglected, making it difficult to understand the transport of spin angular momentum. Here we study the conserved Noether current due to spin-rotation symmetry of the local spins in noncollinear AFMs. Interestingly, we find that a Hall component of the spin current can be generically created by a longitudinal driving force associated with a propagating spin wave, inherently distinguishing noncollinear AFMs from collinear ones. We coin the corresponding Hall coefficient, an isotropic rank-4 tensor, as the Hall (inverse) mass, which generally exists in noncollinear AFMs and their polycrystals. The resulting Hall spin current can be realized by spin pumping in a ferromagnet (FM)-noncollinear AFM bilayer structure as we demonstrate numerically, for which we also give the criteria of ideal boundary conditions. Our results shed light on the potential of noncollinear AFMs in manipulating the polarization and flow of spin currents in general spintronic devices.

Abstract: We study percolation transition of run and tumble particles (RTPs) on a two dimensional square lattice. RTPs in these models run to the nearest neighbour along their internal orientation with unit rate, and to other nearest neighbours with rates $p$. In addition, they tumble to change their internal orientation with rate $\omega$. We show that for small tumble rates, RTP-clusters created by joining occupied nearest neighbours irrespective of their orientation form a phase separated state when the rate of positional diffusion $p$ crosses a threshold; with further increase of $p$ the clusters disintegrate and another transition to a mixed phase occurs. The critical exponents of this re-entrant site-percolation transition of RTPs vary continuously along the critical line in the $\omega$-$p$ plane, but a scaling function remains invariant. This function is identical to the corresponding universal scaling function of percolation transition observed in the Ising model. We also show that the critical exponents of the underlying motility induced phase separation transition are related to corresponding percolation-critical-exponents by constant multiplicative factors known from the correspondence of magnetic and percolation critical exponents of the Ising model.

Abstract: Recent experiments on pentalayer rhombohedral graphene moir\'e superlattices have observed the quantum anomalous Hall effect at moir\'e filling factor of $\nu = 1$ and various fractional values. These phenomena are attributed to a flat Chern band induced by electron-electron interactions. In this study, we demonstrate that at $\nu = 2$, many-body effects can lead to the emergence of quantum spin Hall and quantum valley Hall states, in addition to the quantum anomalous Hall state, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling or valley-dependent potentials. These three topological states can be selectively induced by the application and manipulation of a magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that at $\nu = 3$ and $4$, the ground state can be a combination of topologically trivial and nontrivial states, unlike the cases of $\nu=1$ and 2. This contrasts with the conventional quantum Hall effect in graphene where the ground state at filling factor $\nu$ is given as the particle-hole counterpart at $4-\nu$.

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in high-pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ has garnered significant attention. Using density functional theory, we investigate the magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ at ambient pressure. Our calculations suggest that with $\delta=0$, the double spin stripe phase is favored as the magnetic ground state. Oxygen vacancies may effectively turn nearest Ni spins into \textit{charge} sites. Consequently, with moderate $\delta$ values, our theoretical magnetic ground state exhibits characteristics of both double spin stripe and spin-charge stripe configurations, providing a natural explanation to reconcile the seemingly contradictory experimental findings that suggest both the configurations as candidates for the spin-density-wave phase. With higher $\delta$ values, we anticipate the ground state to become a spin-glass-like noncollinear magnetic phase with only short-range order. The oxygen vacancies are expected to significantly impact the magnetic excitations and the transition temperatures $T_{SDW}$. Notably, the magnetic ordering also induces concomitant charge ordering and orbital ordering, driven by spin-lattice coupling under the low symmetry magnetic order. We further offer a plausible explanation for the experimental observations that the measured $T_{SDW}$ appears insensitive to the variation of samples and the lack of direct evidence for long-range magnetic ordering.

Abstract: The doping evolution behaviors of the normal state magnetic excitations (MEs) of the nickelate La3Ni2O7 are theoretically studied in this paper. For a filling of n = 3.0 which corresponds roughly to the material which realizes the superconductivity of about 80 K under moderately high pressures above 14 GPa, the MEs exhibit a square-like pattern centered at (0,0) which originates from the intrapocket particle-hole scatterings. Furthermore, it was found that the MEs show very strong modulations on the interlayer momentum qz. With the increasing of qz, the patterns of the MEs change dramatically. In the large qz regime, they turn to be ruled by the interpocket excitation modes with significantly larger intensity which may play a vital role in the superconducting pairing. This hidden feature of the MEs was not revealed by previous studies. The established features of the MEs are found to be very robust against doping. They persist in the wide hole- or electron-doping regime around n = 3.0. However, in the heavily electron-doped regime, a Lifshitz transition will occur. Consequently, the behaviors of the MEs change qualitatively across this transition. With the absence of the hole pocket, we predict that a strong tendency toward the spin-density-wave (SDW) order will develop due to the perfect nesting between the electron and the hole pockets at n = 4.0. Thus, we have investigated the normal state behaviors of the MEs and their doping evolutions which may shed light on the mechanism of superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7.

Abstract: We investigate a specific limit of the one-dimensional non-Hermitian Hubbard Hamiltonian with complex interactions. In this framework, fermions with different spin quantum numbers are mapped onto two distinct spin species, resulting in two $XY$ spin chains that are coupled through Ising $ZZ$ interaction. The spin ladder model is then examined within the semiclassical limit using a spin-coherent state basis, where the dynamics is governed by a set of coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations. The non-Hermitian interactions in this model generate a spin-transfer torque term. We analyze the system's evolution toward several potential steady states, including a state of decoupled chains that is accessible when each chain has uniform initial conditions. Other possible steady states involve dimerized configurations with decoupled rungs, where the rung spins are either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically coupled, depending on the sign of the imaginary interactions. The spin dynamics is then studied in the infinite-temperature limit, which favors dimerized steady states. Despite the decoupled rungs, we observe the formation of ferromagnetic domains along each chain in the steady state. Additionally, we investigate the spin correlation functions and identify signatures of anomalous spin dynamics.

Abstract: Nonreciprocal transport, characterized by its direction-selective nature, holds significant potential for applications in various devices. In this study, we investigate nonreciprocal heat transport in Majorana systems, specifically focusing on the Kitaev chiral spin liquid under external magnetic fields. Our theoretical examination focuses on effects of open boundaries in which the Majorana edge modes exist, and the inversion symmetry is broken, which leads to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Through perturbation theory, we demonstrate that DMI induces asymmetric hopping, resulting in the asymmetry of the Majorana band. The results of nonreciprocal heat currents are presented for various directions of external magnetic fields, and we discuss the relation between the current and the field-directions. The potential exists to manipulate both of the directions and magnitude of the nonreciprocal current by varying external magnetic fields and apply to heat transfer devices.

Abstract: We investigate how the signatures of the topological properties of the bandstructures for nodal-point semimetals are embedded in the response coefficients, arising in two distinct experimental set-ups, by taking the Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal as an example. The first scenario involves the computation of third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the charge/thermal current densities to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field/temperature gradient. On the premises that internode scatterings can be ignored, the relaxation-time approximation leads to a quantized value for the nonvanishing components of each of these nonlinear response tensors, characterizing a single untilted RSW node. Furthermore, the final expressions turn out to be insensitive to the specific values of the chemical potential and the temperature. The second scenario involves computing the magnetoelectric conductivity under the action of collinear electric ($\mathbf E$) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields, representing a planar Hall set-up. In particular, our focus is in bringing out the dependence of the linear-in-$|\mathbf B|$ parts of the conductivity tensor on the intrinsic topological properties of the bandstructure, which are nonvanishing only in the presence of a nonzero tilt in the energy spectrum.

Abstract: LiNbO3 films doped with vanadium (V) were deposited using RF magnetron sputtering technique. To realize doping with a wider range of V concentration, a 30 mm V metal inlaid target asymmetrically embedded in the 150 mm lithium niobate target was used. The V concentration in the deposited films was a decreasing function of the distance from the V target. The V/Nb ratio in the film decreased from 0.155 to 0.024. Surface and inner morphology and structure, phase and element composition, microstructure, and ferroelectric properties of the undoped and V doped LiNbO3 films were studied. The measured maximal d33 constant of the LiNbVO film with V/Nb ratio of 0.07 was about three times higher than that of the undoped LiNbO3 film, 13.5 pC/N and 4.76 pC/N, respectively. The optimal composition in the deposition geometry used was within the V/Nb ratio range of 0.05 to 0.13. Undoped and V doped LiNbO3 thin films were used as bulk acoustic wave ultrasonic transducers deposited on stainless steel plates to generate longitudinal waves and compare their ultrasonic performance.

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a novel class of quantum materials with significant potential in spintronics, optoelectronics, valleytronics, and opto-valleytronics. TMDs exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling, enabling efficient spin-charge interconversion, which makes them ideal candidates for spin-orbit torque-driven spintronic devices. In this study, we investigated the spin-to-charge conversion through ferromagnetic resonance in MoS2/Cu/CoFeB heterostructures with varying Cu spacer thicknesses. The conversion efficiency, quantified by the spin Hall angle, was enhanced by an order of magnitude due to Cu intercalation. Magneto-optic Kerr effect microscopy confirmed that Cu did not significantly modify the magnetic domains, indicating its effectiveness in decoupling MoS2 from CoFeB. This decoupling preserves the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of MoS2 by mitigating the exchange interaction with CoFeB, as proximity to localized magnetization can alter the electronic structure and SOC. First-principles calculations revealed that Cu intercalation notably enhances the spin Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity, contributing to the increased spin Hall angle. This study demonstrates that interface engineering of ferromagnet/TMD-based heterostructures can achieve higher spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies, paving the way for advancements in spintronic applications.

Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism within a single material system represents a long-standing goal in condensed matter physics. Van der Waals-based moir\'e superlattices provide an exceptional platform for exploring competing and coexisting broken symmetry states. Alternating twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) exhibits robust superconductivity at the magic angle of 1.57{\deg} and 1.3{\deg}, with suppression at intermediate twist angles. In this study, we investigate the intermediate regime and uncover evidence of orbital magnetism. As previously reported, superconductivity is suppressed near the charge neutrality point (CNP) and emerges at larger moir\'e fillings. Conversely, we find orbital magnetism most substantial near the CNP, diminishing as superconductivity develops. This complementary behavior is similarly observed in the displacement field phase space, highlighting a competitive interplay between the two phases. Utilizing gate-defined Josephson junctions, we probe orbital magnetism by electrostatically tuning the weak links into the magnetic phase, revealing an asymmetric Fraunhofer interference pattern. The estimated orbital ferromagnetic ordering temperature is approximately half the superconducting critical temperature, coinciding with the onset of Fraunhofer asymmetry. Our findings suggest that the observed orbital magnetism is driven by valley polarization and is distinct from the anomalous Hall effect reported at integer fillings in twisted graphene systems. These results offer insights into the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in moir\'e superlattices.

Abstract: The development of Mn-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries promises to alleviate supply chain bottlenecks in battery manufacturing. Challenges in Mn-rich cathodes arise from Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions of Mn$^{3+}$, Mn migration, and phase transformations to spinel-like order, which can affect the electrochemical performance. These phenomena motivate an ab initio re-examination of the thermodynamics of the LiMnO2 polymorphs. It is found that the generalized gradient approximation (GGA - PBEsol) and meta-GGA (r2SCAN) density functionals with empirical on-site Hubbard U corrections yield spurious stable phases for LiMnO2, such as predicting a phase with gamma-LiFeO2-like order (g-LiMnO2) to be the ground state instead of the orthorhombic (Pmmn) phase, which is the experimentally known ground state. Accounting for the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in each structure has a substantial effect on the total energies and resulting phase stability. By using hybrid-GGA (HSE06) and GGA with extended Hubbard parameters (on-site U and inter-site V) that are self-consistently determined, the experimentally observed LiMnO2 phase stability trends are recovered. The calculated Hubbard U in the experimentally observed orthorhombic, layered, and spinel phases (around 5.8 eV) are significantly smaller than U in g-LiMnO2 and disordered layered structures (around 6.4 eV). The smaller values of U are correlated with a collinear ordering of JT distortions, in which all $e_g$ orbitals are oriented in the same direction. This cooperative JT effect leads to increased Mn-O covalency, which contributes to the greater electronic stability compared to the phases with noncollinear JT arrangements, and also generate greater vibrational entropy, which helps stabilize these phases at high temperature. These phases are shown to be strongly insulating with large calculated band gaps > 3 eV, computed using HSE06 and $G_0W_0$.

Abstract: The quest for room-temperature nanoscale magnets remains a central challenge, driven by their promising applications in quantum technologies. Layered $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal oxides with high magnetic ordering temperatures offer significant potential in this context. We explore ultrathin \ce{SrRu2O6} nanosheets using first-principles calculations, complemented by the classical Heisenberg Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, these nanosheets exhibit robust antiferromagnetic ordering with N\'eel temperatures exceeding 430 K, despite the enhanced spin fluctuations characteristic of two-dimensional systems. Surface-termination-induced intrinsic charge doping introduces complexity to the magnetism, resulting in an insulator-to-metal transition and renormalized N\'eel temperatures in doped systems. A detailed microscopic analysis reveals distinct mechanisms underlying the magnetic behavior in electron- and hole-doped nanosheets. These findings provide a foundation for advancing theoretical and experimental studies in the largely unexplored realm of correlated oxides at the two-dimensional limit.

Abstract: We investigate the critical properties of the Anisotropic Next-Nearest-Neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model using a feedback-based quantum algorithm (FQA). We demonstrate how this algorithm enables the computation of both ground and excited states without relying on classical optimization methods. By exploiting symmetries in the algorithm initialization, we show how targeted initial states can increase convergence and facilitate the study of excited states. Using this approach, we study the quantum phase transitions with the Finite Size Scaling method, analyze correlation functions through spin correlations in the ground state, and examine magnetic structure by calculating structure factors via the Discrete Fourier Transform. Our findings highlight FQA's potential as a versatile tool for studying not only the ANNNI model but also other quantum systems, providing insights into quantum phase transitions and the magnetic properties of complex spin models.

Abstract: Turbulent transport driven by trapped electron modes (TEMs) is believed to drive significant heat and particle transport in quasihelically symmetric stellarators. Two three-dimensionally-shaped magnetic configurations with suppressed trapped-electron-mode (TEM)-driven turbulence were generated through optimization that targeted quasihelical symmetry and the available energy of trapped electrons. Initial equilibria have flux surface shapes with a helically rotating negative triangularity (NT) and positive triangularity (PT). In gyrokinetic simulations, TEMs are suppressed in the reduced-TEM NT and PT configurations, showing that negative triangularity does not have the same beneficial turbulence properties over positive triangularity as seen in tokamaks. Heat fluxes from TEMs are also suppressed. Without temperature gradients and with a strong density gradient, the most unstable modes at low $k_y$ were consistent with toroidal universal instabilities (UIs) in the NT case and slab UIs in the PT case. Nonlinear simulations show that UIs drive substantial heat flux in both the NT and PT configurations. A moderate increase in $\beta$ halves the heat flux in the NT configuration, while suppressing the heat flux in the PT geometry. Based on the present work, future optimizations aimed at reducing electrostatic drift wave-driven turbulent transport will need to consider UIs if $\beta$ is sufficiently small.

Abstract: A hybrid spectral/finite-element code is developed to numerically solve the resistive finite-pressure magnetohydrodynamic equilibria without the necessity of postulating nested magnetic flux surfaces in the non-axisymmetric toroidal systems. The adopted approach integrates a hyperbolic parallel damping equation for pressure updating, along with a dynamic resistive relaxation for magnetic field. To address the nonaxisymmetry in toroidal geometry, a pseudo flux mapping is employed to relate the axisymmetric computational domain to the physical domain. On the computational mesh, an isoparametric C1-continuous triangular element is utilized to discretize the poloidal plane, which is complemented with a Fourier decomposition in the toroidal direction. The versatility of the code is demonstrated through its application to several different non-axisymmetric toroidal systems, including the inherently three-dimensional equilibria in stellarators, the helical-core equilibrium states in tokamak plasmas, and the quasi-single-helicity states in a reversed-field pinch.

Abstract: To accelerate ultra-relativistic charged particles, such as electrons, using an electromagnetic pulse along a hollow-core waveguide, the pulse needs to have a longitudinal electric field component and a phase velocity of $c$, the speed of light in vacuum. We derive an approximate closed-form expression for the wavelength at which the phase velocity of the TM$_{01}$ mode in a metal-clad hollow-core fiber with a dielectric layer is $c$. The expression is then used to derive conditions for material dispersion required of the dielectric in order to simultaneously have $c$ phase and group velocity. It is shown that the dispersion would need to be so heavily anomalous that the losses in the anomalously dispersive regime would render such a particle accelerator useless. We then propose the utilization of gain in the form of two spectral peaks in the dielectric to circumvent the otherwise fundamental limits and allow for TM$_{01}$ pulses with $c$ phase and group velocity and thus arbitrary length-scaling of fiber-based electron accelerators. In theory, the group velocity dispersion could also be made zero with further gain-assisted dispersion engineering, allowing for the co-propagation of dispersionless electromagnetic pulses with relativistic particles.

Abstract: Plasma turbulence in the edge of magnetic confinement devices is customarily treated as full-$f$ due to large fluctuations. For computational efficiency, field-aligned coordinates are employed, separating the magnetic field into equilibrium $B_0$ and delta-f perturbations which are handled by the magnetic flutter operators. Evolving the full-$f$ pressure with delta-$f$ magnetic perturbations can cause inconsistency since the latter contain background components such as the Shafranov shift, which are actually parts of the equilibrium magnetic field. Such background components ($B_s$) contained in the magnetic perturbations undermine the field-aligned numerics when treated as flutter: errors arise if $B_s/B_0\ll l_\perp/h_\parallel$ is not satisfied, with the perpendicular turbulence scale $l_\perp$ and the parallel grid distance $h_\parallel$. We find that the commonly used removal of $B_s$ by subtracting the toroidal average of magnetic perturbations intervenes in the Alfv\'en dynamics, causing spurious $E\times B$ transport. Instead, we propose an improved method to dynamically filter out the evolving background from the turbulent magnetic fluctuations in the time domain. The filter is verified in both low and high confinement tokamak conditions, confirming its capability to preserve the turbulence fidelity, provided sufficient filter width.

Abstract: We study how a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field along its standard circular path (cyclotron motion) reacts to a short-duration, homogeneous, uniform electric field pulse injected in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. A `permanent' change in the radius of the initial circle and a shift of its centre is noted at later times, after the pulse is switched off. The magnitude of the velocity undergoes a change too, akin to a `velocity kick'. In summary, our results suggest a pulse-induced `electromagnetic memory-like effect', which is not quite a `wave memory', but, nevertheless, has similar features within a simple, non-relativistic context.

Abstract: For molecules and solids, we developed efficient MPI-parallel algorithms for evaluating the second-order exchange term with bare, statically screened, and dynamically screened interactions. We employ the resulting term in a fully self-consistent manner together with scGW, resulting in the following vertex-corrected scGW schemes: scGWSOX, scGWSOSEX, scGW2SOSEX, and scG3W2theories. We show that for the vertex evaluation, the reduction of scaling by tensor hypercontraction (THC) has two limiting execution regimes. We used the resulting code to perform the largest (by the number of orbitals) fully self-consistent calculations with the SOX term. We demonstrate that our procedure allows for a reliable evaluation of even small energy differences. Utilizing a broken-symmetry approach, we explore the influence of the SOX term on the effective magnetic exchange couplings. We show that the treatment of SOX has a significant impact on the obtained values of the effective exchange constants, which we explain through a self-energy dependence on an effective dielectric constant. We confirm this explanation by analyzing natural orbitals and local changes in charge transfer quantifying superexchange. Our analysis explains the structure of weak electron correlation responsible for the modulation of superexchange in both molecules and solids. Finally, for solids, we evaluate Neel temperatures utilizing the high-temperature expansion and compare the results obtained with experimental measurements.

Abstract: Mechanical stress produced in nano- and micro-scale structures can enhance materials properties, such as the high mobility of silicon in modern transistors or amplified magnetization dynamics in spintronic devices. Here, we report on the dynamics of coherent acoustic phonons excited by femtosecond light pulses and confined in a single freestanding nickel layer, acting as an acoustic cavity. By combining Fourier transform analysis of the experimental signal and numerical multi-physics simulations, we show that high-frequency (> 10 GHz) longitudinal acoustic pulses can resonate inside the cavity and display lower damping compared to a reference nickel film on SiO2 substrate given that the conditions of total reflection are nearly met in the cavity. Our results provide a thorough understanding of the opto-acoustic response in suspended membranes of magnetic materials, which we foresee can be used to amplify magnetization precession dynamics and to develop magneto-acousto-optical modulators.

Abstract: We review the status of the QED calculations for the muonium $2S_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ energy interval and provide the updated theoretical value of $9874.357\pm0.001\,\mathrm{MHz}$. Additionally, we present a model for probing Lorentz-violating coefficients within the Standard Model Extension framework using the fine structure measurement in the presence and absence of a weak external magnetic field, enabling novel tests of CPT and Lorentz symmetry. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that a precision of $\sim 10\,\mathrm{kHz}$ on the isolated $2S_{1/2}, F=1 - 2P_{3/2}, F=1$ transition could be achievable employing Ramsey's separate oscillatory fields (SOF) technique. Collecting the required statics will become feasible with the upcoming High-Intensity Muon Beam (HiMB) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. These advancements will enable precise tests of radiative QED corrections and nuclear self-energy contributions, while also providing tests of new physics and sensitivity to unconstrained coefficients for Lorentz violation within the Standard Model Extension framework.

Abstract: Recently, large models, or foundation models, have exhibited remarkable performance, profoundly impacting research paradigms in diverse domains. Foundation models, trained on extensive and diverse datasets, provide exceptional generalization abilities, allowing for their straightforward application across various use cases and domains. Exploration geophysics is the study of the Earth's subsurface to find natural resources and help with environmental and engineering projects. It uses methods like analyzing seismic, magnetic, and electromagnetic data, which presents unique challenges and opportunities for the development of geophysical foundation models (GeoFMs). This perspective explores the potential applications and future research directions of GeoFMs in exploration geophysics. We also review the development of foundation models, including large language models, large vision models, and large multimodal models, as well as their advancement in the field of geophysics. Furthermore, we discuss the hierarchy of GeoFMs for exploration geophysics and the critical techniques employed, providing a foundational research workflow for their development. Lastly, we summarize the challenges faced in developing GeoFMs, along with future trends and their potential impact on the field. In conclusion, this perspective provides a comprehensive overview of the development, hierarchy, applications, development workflow, and challenges of foundation models, highlighting their transformative potential in advancing exploration geophysics.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provides high-resolution visualization of atomic structures as well as various functional imaging modes utilizing phase contrast. In this study we introduce a semicircular aperture in STEM bright field imaging, which gives a phase contrast transfer function that becomes complex and includes both lower and higher spatial frequency contrast transfer. This approach offers significant advantages over conventional phase plate methods, having no charge accumulation, degradation, or unwanted background noise, which are all problematic in the phase plate material. Also compared to the differential phase contrast or ptychography equipment, this semicircular aperture is far less costly. We apply this approach to visualization of polymer, biological and magnetic samples.

Abstract: The theory of plasmas, that is collectives of charged particles, is developed using the coordinate-free and geometric methods of exterior calculus. This dramatically simplifies the algebra and gives a geometric physical interpretation. The fundamental foundation on which the theory is built is the conservation of phase space volume expressed by the Generalized Liouville Equation in terms of the Lie derivative. The theory is expanded both in the order of the correlation and in the weakness of the correlation. This gives a Generalized BBGKY (Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon) Hierarchy. The derivation continues to give a new generalized formula for the Variational Theory of Reaction Rates (VTRR). Pullbacks of the generalized formulas to generic canonical coordinates and Poisson brackets are done. Where appropriate, the canonical coordinates are assumed to be "action-angle" coordinates that are generated by the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the action. Finally, generalized forms of all the common kinetic equations are derived: the Vlasov Equation, the Boltzmann Equation, the Master Equation, the Fokker-Planck Equation, the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) Equation, the Fluid Equations, and the MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) Equations. Specific examples are given of these equations. The application of the VTRR to three-body recombination in a strong magnetic field is shown.

Abstract: LiNbO3 films doped with vanadium (V) were deposited using RF magnetron sputtering technique. To realize doping with a wider range of V concentration, a 30 mm V metal inlaid target asymmetrically embedded in the 150 mm lithium niobate target was used. The V concentration in the deposited films was a decreasing function of the distance from the V target. The V/Nb ratio in the film decreased from 0.155 to 0.024. Surface and inner morphology and structure, phase and element composition, microstructure, and ferroelectric properties of the undoped and V doped LiNbO3 films were studied. The measured maximal d33 constant of the LiNbVO film with V/Nb ratio of 0.07 was about three times higher than that of the undoped LiNbO3 film, 13.5 pC/N and 4.76 pC/N, respectively. The optimal composition in the deposition geometry used was within the V/Nb ratio range of 0.05 to 0.13. Undoped and V doped LiNbO3 thin films were used as bulk acoustic wave ultrasonic transducers deposited on stainless steel plates to generate longitudinal waves and compare their ultrasonic performance.

# Precision labeling of proteins in live cells illustrated by in-cell 19F-NMR spectroscopy

## 通过细胞内19F-NMR光谱说明活细胞中蛋白质的精确标记

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-gsprr?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Jia-Long, Zhao

Deciphering protein activity in living cells, especially at atomic resolution, remains a challenge. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a unique tool to provide atomic-resolution information of proteins in live cells, but most currently modification methods for proteins are not suitable for in-cell NMR. Here we introduce a new strategy for site-precise labeling of proteins via a reversible Michael addition reaction-triggered neighbor group participation (RAT-NGP), where the NGP reaction stabilizes the reversible Michael addition product. The RAT-NGP labeling shows high performance in precision labeling of two engineered solvent-exposed cysteines without perturbations on the native cysteines in the target proteins. This labeling strategy causes no significant structural perturbations in the target proteins as examined by NMR and CD spectroscopy. In-cell 19F NMR shows that the RAT-NGP labeling method enables site-precise labeling of target proteins in live cells and effectively avoids the over consumption and interference of intracellular glutathione (GSH).

# MRI regional strain analysis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Mediterranean cohort

## 地中海队列中肥厚型心肌病患者的MRI区域应变分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5678626/latest

Purpose: To evaluate the regional left ventricular myocardial strain in patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) especially young apparently compensated patients by magnetic resonance imaging.
Materials and Methods: 25 HCM patients representing all age groups and 25 healthy volunteers underwent 1.5 Tesla MRI examination for cardiac volumes, and mass, followed by regional strain analysis in radial, circumferential, and longitudinal directions as regard the displacement, strain, peak diastolic and systolic strain rate, peak diastolic and systolic velocity, time to peak displacement and time to peak strain.
Results: In the HCM group, hypertrophic segments showing delayed gadolinium enhancement (DGE) were significantly different from non-hypertrophic apparently normal showing no enhancement concerning most of the regional radial strain parameters.
In longitudinal and circumferential directions, hypertrophic segments showing DGE were significantly different from apparently normal segments with no enhancement as regard the strain, peak diastolic and systolic strain rate.
Compared to normal volunteers, the hypertrophic segments with DGE were significantly different concerning most of the radial and longitudinal strain parameters, while apparently normal segments with no enhancement don&rsquo;t present a similar significant difference.
In circumferential analysis, hypertrophic enhancing segments were significantly different as regard the strain, peak diastolic strain rate, peak systolic velocity, and time to peak displacement, while the apparently normal non-enhancing segments present difference concerning the strain, peak systolic velocity, and time to peak displacement.
Conclusion
The hypertrophied segments showing DGE are more affected than the segments of apparently normal thickness non enhancing in HCM patients, especially in the radial direction, the apparently normal segments are less affected with no tendency of functional compensation.
These findings are crucial in young age apparently compensated patients&rsquo; diagnosis follow up.

# Inhibiting CSF1R signaling reduces disc degeneration and discogenic back pain

## 抑制CSF1R信号可减轻椎间盘退变和椎间盘源性背痛

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5647673/latest

Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is one of the major causes of low back pain. Inflammation has been implicated in discogenic back pain and disc degeneration, however, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Herein we demonstrate that Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R) signaling plays an essential role in the development of IVD degeneration and discogenic back pain. Genetic deletion of CSF1R from microglia/macrophages or oral administration of a CSF1R competitive inhibitor, GW2580, decreased IVD degeneration as evidenced by serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological analyses in adult mice following disc injury. CSF1R deletion or GW2580 administration inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine release from injured discs and blocked dorsal root ganglion (DRG) macrophage and spinal cord dorsal horn microglia activation and in so doing, eliminated neuropathic pain secondary to disc injury. These results suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chronic low back pain secondary to IVD degeneration.

# Efficacy of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Smoking Cessation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

## 重复经颅磁刺激戒烟效果的系统评价和Meta分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5665829/latest

Background Tobacco use disorder remains one of the most prevalent substances use disorders globally, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality. While pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been effective, relapse rates remain high, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. One such approach is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has shown promise in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including medication-resistant conditions.Objective To evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in smoking cessation, its impact on abstinence rates, nicotine dependence, and craving.Methods We conducted a comprehensive search across multiple databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and Clinicaltrials.gov) from inception to August 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating rTMS as a treatment for smoking cessation, with outcomes including nicotine dependence, craving, abstinence, and cigarette consumption.Results  We included 17 RCTs involving 859 participants were included in this review. The pooled analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction in nicotine dependence based on the Fagerstr&amp;ouml;m Test (mean difference = -0.47, 95% CI [-0.88 to -0.06], P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.03). rTMS also demonstrated significant reductions in craving, as measured by the Tobacco Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (mean difference = -10.88, 95% CI [-12.87 to -8.89], P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.00001). Self-reported abstinence showed a significant improvement (risk ratio&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1.91, 95% CI [1.16 to 3.14], P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.01). However, no significant effects were observed for self-reported cigarette consumption (mean difference = -3.81, 95% CI [-7.99 to 0.38], P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.07) or the Visual Analog Scale for craving (pooled standardized mean difference = -0.27, 95% CI [-0.66 to 0.12], P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.17). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant differences based on rTMS targets (e.g., DLPFC, insula) or the number of sessions.Conclusion rTMS shows promising potential as an adjunctive treatment for smoking cessation by reducing nicotine dependence, alleviating craving, and improving abstinence rates. However, its effectiveness is not uniform across all smoking-related outcomes. With further research, rTMS could become a valuable component of comprehensive smoking cessation strategies.

# Spectroscopic and molecular insights into humic substances in compost amended with varying biochar levels

## 用不同的生物炭水平对堆肥中腐殖质的光谱和分子见解进行了修正

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5509938/latest

This study explores the effects of biochar (BC) amendments at varying levels (0%, 1%, 2%, and 5%) on the molecular and structural characteristics of humic substances (HS), specifically humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), in compost. The addition of BC significantly increased the HA content by 13-16% while reducing the FA content by 12-32%, with the most pronounced effects observed at a 5% BC addition. Spectroscopic analyses, including UV-Vis and fluorescence, revealed enhanced aromaticity and molecular weight (MW) of HA, driven by microbial activity and polymerization facilitated by BC amendments, whereas FA aromaticity remained largely unchanged. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and number-average molecular weight (Mn) of HA increased significantly, indicating improved humification and stabilization. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that BC addition had minimal impact on the functional group composition of HA and FA but altered the proportions of carbon types. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis demonstrated higher persistent free radical (PFR) levels in HA, correlating with increased molecular size and a higher degree of condensation. These findings underscore the potential of BC amendments to enhance compost quality by promoting the formation of stable and complex humic substances with improved reactivity.

# Altermagnetism and Strain Induced Altermagnetic Transition in Cairo Pentagonal Monolayer

## 开罗五边形单层中的磁和应变诱导的磁转变

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5691373/latest

Altermagnetism, a recently discovered class of magnetic order characterized by vanishing net magnetization and spin-splitting band structures, has garnered significant research attention. In this work, we introduce a novel two-dimensional system that exhibits g-wave altermagnetism and undergoes a strain-induced transition from g-wave to d-wave altermagnetism. This system can be realized in an unconventional monolayer Cairo pentagonal lattice, for which we present a realistic tight-binding model that incorporates both magnetic and non-magnetic sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-trivial band topology can emerge in this system by breaking the symmetry that protects the spin-polarized nodal points. Finally, ab initio calculations on several candidate materials, such as FeS2 and Nb2FeB2, which exhibit symmetry consistent with the proposed tight-binding Hamiltonian, are also presented. These findings open new avenues for exploring spintronic devices based on altermagnetic systems.
