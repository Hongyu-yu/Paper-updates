It turns out that the boundary, being extensive, plays a dominant role. At the boundary, spin fluctuations are enhanced. The metal-insulator transition observed on some geometries is a consequence of the boundary. The magnetically ordered phase at weak coupling shows macroscopic moments that cancel to form a spin-singlet ground state.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRB/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.235105.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

# A New Moir\'e Platform Based on M-Point Twisting

## 一种基于M点扭转的新型Moir \ &#39;e平台

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18684

arXiv:2411.18684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of moir\'e systems and materials based on monolayers with triangular lattices and low-energy states at the M points of the Brillouin zone. These M-point moir\'e materials are fundamentally distinct from those derived from $\Gamma$- or K-point monolayers, featuring three time-reversal-preserving valleys related by three-fold rotational symmetry. We propose twisted bilayers of experimentally exfoliable 1T-SnSe$_2$ and 1T-ZrS$_2$ as realizations of this new class. Using extensive ab initio simulations, we develop quantitative continuum models and analytically show that the corresponding M-point moir\'e Hamiltonians exhibit emergent momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetries and a kagome plane-wave lattice in momentum space. This represents the first experimentally viable realization of a projective representation of crystalline space groups in a non-magnetic system. With interactions, these materials represent six-flavor Hubbard simulators with Mott physics, as can be seen by their flat Wilson loops. Furthermore, the presence of a non-symmorphic momentum-space in-plane mirror symmetry makes some of the M-point moir\'e Hamiltonians quasi-one-dimensional in each valley, suggesting the possibility of realizing Luttinger liquid physics. We predict the twist angles at which a series of (conduction) flat bands appear, provide a faithful continuum Hamiltonian, analyze its topology and charge density and briefly discuss several aspects of the physics of this new platform.

Abstract: The experimental realisation of unconventional superconductivity and charge order in kagome systems \textit{A}V$_3$Sb$_5$ is of critical importance. We conducted a highly systematic study of Cs(V$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$ with $x$=0.07 (Nb$_{0.07}$-CVS) by employing a unique combination of tuning parameters such as doping, hydrostatic pressure, magnetic fields, and depth, using muon spin rotation, AC susceptibility, and STM. We uncovered tunable magnetism in the normal state of Nb$_{0.07}$-CVS, which transitions to a time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking superconducting state under pressure. Specifically, our findings reveal that the bulk of Nb$_{0.07}$-CVS (at depths greater than 20 nm from the surface) experiences TRS breaking below $T^*=40~$K, lower than the charge order onset temperature, $T_\mathrm{CO}$ = 58 K. However, near the surface (within 20 nm from the surface), the TRS breaking signal doubles and onsets at $T_\mathrm{CO}$, indicating that Nb-doping decouples TRS breaking from charge order in the bulk but synchronises them near the surface. Additionally, Nb-doping raises the superconducting critical temperature $T_\mathrm{C}$ from 2.5 K to 4.4 K. Applying hydrostatic pressure enhances both $T_\mathrm{C}$ and the superfluid density by a factor of two, with a critical pressure $p_\mathrm{cr}$ ${\simeq}$ 0.85 GPa, suggesting competition with charge order. Notably, above $p_\mathrm{cr}$, we observe nodeless electron pairing and weak internal fields below $T_\mathrm{C}$, indicating broken TRS in the superconducting state. Overall, these results demonstrate a highly unconventional normal state with a depth-tunable onset of TRS breaking at ambient pressure, a transition to TRS-breaking superconductivity under low hydrostatic pressure, and an unconventional scaling between $T_\mathrm{C}$ and the superfluid density.

# Non-relativistic spin splitting above and below the Fermi level in a $g$-wave altermagnet

## $ g $ 波altermagnet中费米能级上下的非相对论自旋分裂

arXiv:2411.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are distinguished by their unique spin group symmetries, where spin and spatial symmetries are fully decoupled, resulting in nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of electronic bands. This phenomenon, unlike conventional spin splitting driven by relativistic spin-orbit coupling, has transformative potential in fields such as spintronics, superconductivity and energy-efficient electronics. However, direct observation of NRSS is challenging due to presence of competing phases, low N\'eel temperatures, and the limitations of existing experimental probes to unambiguously capture the associated properties. Here, we integrate theoretical and experimental approaches to uncover NRSS in the intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoNb$_4$Se$_8$. Symmetry analysis, density functional theory (DFT), a novel Symmetry-Constrained Adaptive Basis (SCAB), and tight-binding modeling predict the presence of symmetry-enforced spin splitting, which we directly confirm using spin-ARPES for the occupied band structure and a newly developed technique, spin- and angle-resolved electron reflection spectroscopy (spin-ARRES), for the unoccupied states. Together, these complementary tools reveal alternating spin textures consistent with our predicted g-wave altermagnetic order and demonstrate the persistence of NRSS across a broad energy range. Crucially, temperature-dependent measurements show the suppression of NRSS at the N\'eel temperature ($T_N$), providing the first direct evidence of an altermagnetic phase transition. Residual spin splitting above $T_N$ suggests the coexistence of altermagnetic fluctuations and spin-orbit coupling effects, underscoring a complex interplay of mechanisms. By establishing CoNb$_4$Se$_8$ as a prototypical g-wave altermagnet, this work offers a robust framework for understanding NRSS, and lays the foundation for designing energy-efficient spin-based technologies.

Abstract: Observing the amplitude-Higgs mode in superconductors has been a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Unlike the phase mode in the electromagnetic (EM) response, the amplitude mode is not needed to satisfy gauge invariance. Indeed, it couples to linear EM response properties only in special superconductors that are associated with a pairing vector $\mathbf{Q} \neq 0$. In this paper we characterize the amplitude-mode contribution within a gauge-invariant treatment of the linear optical conductivity for these non-uniform superconductors, noting that they are by their very nature particularly vulnerable to pair-breaking from non-magnetic impurities. This leads to inevitable damping of the Higgs mode. Our gauge-invariant formulation provides an in-depth understanding of two sets of $f$-sum rules which must be obeyed. We illustrate how difficult it is to disentangle the neutral amplitude mode contributions from those of the charged quasi-particles. These observations are presented in the context of an applied supercurrent, where we observe a new low-frequency feature that reflects the superfluid density and appears consistent with recent experiments.

Abstract: Understanding the coherent interplay of light with the magnetization in metals has been a long-standing problem in ultrafast magnetism. While it is known that when laser light acts on a metal it can induce magnetization via the process known as the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), the most basic ingredients of this phenomenon are still largely unexplored. In particular, given a strong recent interest in orbital non-equilibrium dynamics and its role in mediating THz emission in transition metals, the exploration of distinct features in spin and orbital IFE is pertinent. Here, we present a first complete study of the spin and orbital IFE in $3d$, $4d$ and $5d$ transition metals of groups IV$-$XI from first-principles. By examining the dependence on the light polarization and frequency, we show that the laser-induced spin and orbital moments may vary significantly both in magnitude and sign. We underpin the interplay between the crystal field splitting and spin-orbit interaction as the key factor which determines the magnitude and key differences between the spin and orbital response. Additionally, we highlight the anisotropy of the effect with respect to the ferromagnetic magnetization and to the crystal structure. The provided complete map of IFE in transition metals is a key reference point in the field of optical magnetism.

# Continuous Collapse of the Spin Cycloid in BiFeO3 Thin Films under and Applied Magnetic Field probed by Neutron Scattering

Abstract: Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is one of the rare materials that exhibits multiferroic properties already at room-temperature. Therefore, it offers tremendous potential for future technological applications, such as memory and logic. However, a weak magnetoelectric coupling together with the presence of a noncollinear cycloidal spin order restricts various practical applications of BiFeO3. Therefore, there is a large interest in the search for suitable methods for the modulation of the spin cycloid in BiFeO3. By performing neutron diffraction experiments using a triple-axis instrument we have determined that the spin cycloid can be systematically suppressed by applying a high magnetic field of 10 T in a BiFeO3 thin film of about 100 nm grown on a (110)-oriented SrTiO3 substrate. As predicted by previous theoretical calculations, we observed that the required critical magnetic field to suppress the spin cycloid in a BiFeO3 thin film was lower as compared to the previously reported critical magnetic field for bulk BiFeO3 single crystals. Our experiment reveals that the spin cycloid continuously expands with increasing magnetic field before the complete transformation into a G-type antiferromagnetic spin order. Such tuning of the length of the spin cycloid up to a complete suppression offers new functionalities for future technological applications as in spintronics or magnonics.

Abstract: We examine the viability of twisted bilayers of group IV and IVB trigonal transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MX$_{2}$ (M$=$Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and X$=$S, Se, Te) as a moir\'{e} material platform. We show that the low energy conduction band states in these systems are accurately described by a set of three emergent periodic Hamiltonians which we derive for a representative homobilayer from small unit cell density functional theory calculations using a local displacement approximation. In monolayer form, these TMDs have conduction band minima with anisotropic effective masses near the three inequivalent Brillouin zone $M$ points, implying a moir\'e band model that has six flavors when spin is included. Because each $M$ point is time-reversal invariant, spontaneous valley polarization is signaled in transport by anisotropy instead of by the anomalous Hall and magnetic circular dichroism effects commonly seen in graphene and $K$-valley TMD based moir\'{e} multilayers.

arXiv:2411.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate magnetic structures of materials is crucial for the advancements in material science, spintronics, and geology. Recent developments of quantum-enabled magnetometers, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, have enabled direct imaging of magnetic field distributions associated with a wide variety of magnetic profiles. However, reconstructing the magnetization of a sample from a measured magnetic field map poses a complex inverse problem, which can be further complicated by the presence of measurement noise, finite spatial resolution, and the sample-to-sensor distance. While magnetic field distributions are typically measured through various available imaging methods, accurately reconstructing the underlying structures from these maps remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient GPU-based method for reconstructing magnetic source quantities (i.e. spatially varying magnetization density) from measured magnetic fields with minimum prior assumptions. We validate our method by simulating diverse magnetic structures under realistic experimental conditions, including multi-domain ferromagnetism and magnetic spin textures such as skyrmion, anti-skyrmion, and meron. Experimentally, we apply our technique to investigate the magnetic field maps from a lunar rock (Apollo lunar mare basalt sample 10003,184) obtained using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. The reconstructed magnetic domains of the lunar rock are consistent with current paleomagnetic knowledge. Our approach provides a versatile and universal tool for investigating complex magnetization profiles, paving the way for future quantum sensing experiments.

Abstract: The quasi two-dimensional kagome ferrimagnet TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ is investigated for thermo-remanent magnetization and Hall effects. On cooling under a moderate magnetic field, the sample attains a magnetization value close to the saturation magnetization. Upon heating in a very small magnetic field, the sample continues to maintain the large value of magnetization, which eventually diminishes distinctly at around 200 K manifesting an ultrasharp jump. A similar feature is also observed in the Hall resistivity, which holds its saturation value when heated back in zero field after being field-cooled. The ultrasharp jump in magnetization is also get reflected in our Hall data. The observed data is exotic and can be rooted to the large anisotropy and the strong exchange interaction.

Abstract: We studied the structural and magnetic properties of the solid solution Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B through theoretical and experimental approaches. Powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray Pair Distribution Function analysis, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveal that the Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B solid solution crystallizes in the FeB structure type up to x = 0.6-0.7 and exhibits anisotropic unit cell volume contraction with increasing Ni concentration. Magnetic measurements showed a transition from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism around x = 0.7. For x = 0.5, the low (< 0.3 $\mu_{B}$) magnetic moments suggest itinerant magnetism despite the relatively high Curie temperature (up to 225 K). Theoretical calculations indicated different types of magnetic orderings depending on the Fe/Ni atomic order, with the antiferromagnetic state being stable for ordered FeNiB$_{2}$, whereas the ground state is ferromagnetic for the disordered alloy. Calculations also predicted the coexistence of low- and high-spin states in Fe atoms around the composition with x=0.5, in line with the experimental evidence from $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. The two magnetically distinct Fe sites for x = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 observed by $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy can also be interpreted as two magnetically different regions or clusters that could affect the critical behavior near a quantum magnetic transition based on a potential ferromagnetic quantum critical point identified computationally and experimentally near x=0.64. This work highlights the complex interplay between structure and magnetism in Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B alloys, suggesting areas for future research on quantum critical behavior.

arXiv:2411.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Weyl semimetals, the nonlinear planar Hall effect (NPHE) and spin-orbit torque (SOT) are prominent manifestations of nonlinear and linear charge-spin conversion, respectively. However, simultaneous investigations of these phenomena within a single material system are scarce, limiting our understanding of their intrinsic connection and underlying mechanisms. Here, we report the first simultaneous observation of NPHE and SOT in a TaIrTe4/Py heterostructure. By employing harmonic Hall measurements and developing a magnetic field-dependent method, we successfully separated the contributions from NPHE, field-like SOT, and damping-like SOT, enabling accurate characterization of both linear and nonlinear charge-spin conversion properties. Our experiments revealed significant anisotropy along the [100] and [010] crystallographic directions of TaIrTe4, with stronger nonlinear responses and field-like SOT along the [100] direction, and larger damping-like SOT along the [010] direction. The distinct directional dependence of these phenomena provides new insights into the interplay between surface and bulk contributions to charge-spin conversion in Weyl semimetals. These findings enhance our understanding of anisotropic charge-spin conversion mechanisms in Weyl semimetals, which may inform future research and development of spintronic devices based on topological materials.

Abstract: FeSn is a room-temperature antiferromagnet composed of alternating Fe3Sn kagome layers and honeycomb Sn layers. Its distinctive lattice allows the formation of linearly dispersing Dirac bands and topological flat bands in its electronic band structure, positioning FeSn as an ideal candidate for investigating the interplay between magnetism and topology. In this study, we investigate the epitaxial growth of FeSn thin films on GaAs(111) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. A significant challenge in this growth process is the diffusion of Ga and As from the substrate into the deposited films and the diffusion of Fe into the substrate. This diffusion complicates the formation of a pure FeSn phase. Through a comprehensive analysis-including reflection high energy electron diffraction, high-resolution X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry-we demonstrate that the Sn evaporation temperature plays a critical role in influencing the crystallinity, surface morphology, and magnetic behaviour of the films. Our results show that while it is difficult to grow a single-phase FeSn film on GaAs due to diffusion, optimizing the Sn evaporation temperature can enhance the dominance of the FeSn phase, partially overcoming these challenges.

Abstract: Altermagnets (AM) are a recently discovered third class of collinear magnets, and have been attracting significant interest in the field of condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we propose four two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials--monolayer V$_2$Te$_2$O, V$_2$STeO, V$_2$SSeO, and V$_2$S$_2$O--as candidates for altermagnetic materials. We show that these materials are semiconductors with spin-splitting in their nonrelativistic band structures. Furthermore, in the band structure, there are a pair of Dirac-type valleys located at the time-reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) X and Y points. These two valleys are connected by crystal symmetry instead of time-reversal symmetry. We investigate the strain effect on the band structure and find that uniaxial strain can induce valley polarization, topological states in these monolayer materials. Moreover, piezomagnetism can be realized upon finite doping. Our result reveals interesting valley physics in monolayer V$_2$Te$_2$O, V$_2$STeO, V$_2$SSeO, and V$_2$S$_2$O, suggesting their great potential for valleytronics, spintronics, and multifunctional nanoelectronics applications.

arXiv:2411.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kirchhoff's kinetic analogy relates the equilibrium solutions of an elastic rod or strip to the motion of a spinning top. In this analogy, time is replaced by the arc length parameter in the phase portrait to determine the equilibrium configurations of the rod. Predicted equilibrium solutions from the phase portrait for specific boundary value problems, as well as certain localized solutions, have been experimentally observed. In this study, we employ the kinetic analogy to investigate the equilibrium solutions of planar soft ferromagnetic rods subjected to transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. Our analysis reveals a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation in the phase portrait of a ferromagnetic rod subjected to transverse external magnetic field as the axial load is decreased continuously from a large compressive load. Similarly, a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation is observed in the case of longitudinal external magnetic field. We predict equilibrium configurations for a free-standing soft ferromagnetic elastic rod and the same subjected to canonical boundary conditions. Furthermore, we observe novel localized equilibrium solutions arising from homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, which are absent in the phase portraits of purely elastic rods.

Abstract: The magnetic properties of CrI$_3$ monolayers, which were recently measured, have been investigated considering electronic repulsion and localization effects in Cr 3d orbitals. In this study, we propose a DFT approach using Hubbard U corrections to improve accuracy. We compare the valence density-of-states using the HSE06 hybrid functional and the DFT+U approach, which includes U parameters for both Cr 3d and I 5p orbitals. The results of our study indicate that the optimal values for U(Cr$_{3d}$) and U(I$_{5p}$) are 3.5 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. This approach is further applied to improve calculations of electronic and magnetic properties in CrI$_3$ monolayers and, more importantly, in bilayers combined with van der Waals functionals. These refinements hold promise for further studies of complex CrI$_3$ nanostructures, and may also be of interest for other trihalide few-layer systems.

Abstract: CoSn and FeSn, two kagome-lattice metals, have recently attracted significant attention as hosts of electronic flat bands and emergent physical properties. However, current understandings of their physical properties are limited to the knowledge of the average crystal structure. Here, we report the Fe-doping induced co-emergence of the antiferromagentic (AFM) order and local symmetry breaking in (Co0.45Fe0.55)Sn. Rietveld analysis on the neutron and synchrotron x-ray diffraction data indicates A-type antiferromagnetic order with the moment pointing perpendicular to the kagome layers, associated with the anomaly in the MSn(1)2Sn(2)4 (M = Co/Fe) octahedral distortion and the lattice constant c. Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling of the synchrotron x-ray total scattering results captured the subtle local orthorhombic distortion involving off-axis displacements of Sn2. Our results indicate that the stable hexagonal lattice above TN becomes unstable once the A-type AFM order is formed below TN. We argue that the local symmetry breaking has a magnetic origin and is driven by the out-of-plane magnetic exchange coupling. Our study provides comprehensive information on the crystal structure in both long-range scale and local scale, unveiling unique coupling between AFM order, octahedral distortion, and hidden local symmetry breaking.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets with spin-phonon coupling are crucial for next-generation spintronics. Among them, Fe3GaTe2 has attracted widespread attention due to above-room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, the lattice vibrations and the interplay between ferromagnetism and lattice vibrations in Fe3GaTe2 are still unexplored. Here, we report the lattice vibration, Raman modes, and room-temperature spin-phonon coupling in 2D Fe3GaTe2 with above-room-temperature Curie temperature (TC). Two typical Raman modes with out-of-plane lattice vibrations are identified: "A" _"1g" ^"1" and "A" _"1g" ^"2" , whose frequencies increase as the thickness decreases from bulk to 2D Fe3GaTe2 due to the weakening of interlayer vdW interactions and spin exchange coupling. Moreover, the difference between phonon band dispersions under ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic interlayer spin ordering indicates the existence of spin-phonon coupling. The phonon frequency diverges from the anharmonic model below TC and thus the strength of spin-phonon coupling is ~0.28 cm-1 at 300 K, which is the first experimental identification of room-temperature spin-phonon coupling in 2D vdW magnets. This work deepens the understanding of novel 2D vdW magnets and provides a basis for spintronic applications at and above room temperature.

Abstract: We performed single-crystal magnetic susceptibility and $^1$H NMR measurements on a quasi-1D, spin-1 antiferromagnet NiC$_2$O$_4$$\cdot$2NH$_3$, with temperature down to 100 mK and with field up to 26 T. With field applied along the chain direction (crystalline $b$ direction), a spin gap is determined at low fields. Our susceptibility and spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal a Haldane phase at low field, with an intrachain exchange coupling $J$ $\approx$ 35 K and an easy-plane single-ion anisotropy of 17 K. A field-induced antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering emerges at fields of 2.1 T, which sets a three-dimensional (3D) quantum critical point (QCP). The high-temperature spin-lattice relaxation rates $1/T_1$ resolves an onset of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior at field above $3.5$ T, which characterizes a hidden 1D QCP.

arXiv:2411.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-wall skyrmions (DWSKs) are topological spin textures confined within domain walls that have recently attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in racetrack memory technologies. In this study, we theoretically investigated the motion of DWSKs driven by spin-polarized currents in ferromagnetic strips. Our findings reveal that the motion of DWSKs is contingent upon the direction of the current. When the current is applied parallel to the domain wall, both spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT) can drive the DWSK along the domain wall. Conversely, for currents applied perpendicular to the domain wall, STT can induce DWSK motion by leveraging the skyrmion Hall effect as a driving force, whereas SOT-driven DWSKs halt their motion after sliding along the domain wall. Furthermore, we demonstrated the current-driven motion of DWSKs along curved domain walls and proposed a racetrack memory architecture utilizing DWSKs. These findings advance the understanding of DWSK dynamics and provide insights for the design of spintronic devices based on DWSKs.

arXiv:2411.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat elastic sheets tend to display wrinkles and folds. From pieces of clothing down to two-dimensional crystals, these corrugations appear in response to strain generated by sheet compression or stretching, thermal or mechanical mismatch with other elastic layers, or surface tension. Extensively studied in metals, polymers and, more recently, in van der Waals exfoliated layers, with the advent of thin single crystal freestanding films of complex oxides, researchers are now paying attention to novel microstructural effects induced by bending ferroelectric-ferroelastics, where polarization is strongly coupled to lattice deformation. Here we show that wrinkle undulations in BaTiO3 sheets bonded to a viscoelastic substrate transform into a buckle delamination geometry when transferred onto a rigid substrate. Using spatially resolved techniques at different scales (Raman, scanning probe and electron microscopy), we show how these delaminations in the free BaTiO3 sheets display a self-organization of ferroelastic domains along the buckle profile that strongly differs from the more studied sinusoidal wrinkle geometry. Moreover, we disclose the hierarchical distribution of a secondary set of domains induced by the misalignment of these folding structures from the preferred in-plane crystallographic orientations. Our results disclose the relevance of the morphology and orientation of buckling instabilities in ferroelectric free sheets, for the stabilization of different domain structures, pointing to new routes for domain engineering of ferroelectrics in flexible oxide sheets.

# Critical heat current fluctuations in Curie-Weiss model in and out of equilibrium

arXiv:2411.19643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some models of nonequilibrium phase transitions, fluctuations of the analyzed currents have been observed to diverge with system size. To assess whether this behavior is universal across phase transitions, we examined heat current fluctuations in the Curie-Weiss model, a paradigmatic model of the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition, coupled to two thermal baths. This model exhibits phase transitions driven by both the temperature and the magnetic field. We find that at the temperature-driven phase transition, the heat current noise consists of two contributions: the equilibrium part, which vanishes with system size, and the nonequilibrium part, which diverges with system size. For small temperature differences, this leads to nonmonotonic scaling of fluctuations with system size. In contrast, at the magnetic-field-driven phase transition, heat current fluctuations do not diverge when observed precisely at the phase transition point. Instead, out of equilibrium, the noise is enhanced at the magnetic field values away but close to the phase transition point, due to stochastic switching between two current values. The maximum value of noise increases exponentially with system size, while the position of this maximum shifts towards the phase transition point. Finally, on the methodological side, the paper demonstrates that current fluctuations in large systems can be effectively characterized by combining a path integral approach for macroscopic fluctuations together with an effective two-state model describing subextensive transitions between the two macroscopic states involved in the phase transition.

Abstract: Layered van der Waals tellurides reveal topologically non-trivial properties that give rise to unconventional magneto-transport phenomena. Additionally, their semimetallic character with high mobility makes them promising candidates for large magneto-thermoelectric effects. Remarkable studies on the very large and unconventional Nernst effect in WTe$_2$ have been reported, raising questions about whether this property is shared across the entire family of van der Waals tellurides.
  In this study, systematic measurements of the Nernst effect in telluride van der Waals Weyl semimetals are presented. Large linear Nernst coefficients in WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ are identified, and moderate Nernst coefficients with non-linear behavior in magnetic fields are observed in W$_{0.65}$Mo$_{0.35}$Te$_2$, TaIrTe$_4$, and TaRhTe$_4$. Within this sample set, a correlation between the dominant linear-in-magnetic-field component of the Nernst coefficient and mobility is established, aligning with the established Nernst scaling framework, though with a different scaling factor compared to existing literature. This enhancement might be caused by the shared favorable electronic band structure of this family of materials. Conversely, the non-linear component of the Nernst effect in a magnetic field could not be correlated with mobility. This non-linear term is almost absent in the binary compounds, suggesting a multiband origin and strong compensation between electron-like and hole-like carriers. This comprehensive study highlights the potential of van der Waals tellurides for thermoelectric conversion.

Abstract: Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) is a powerful measurement technique often used in scanning tunneling spectroscopy to probe excited states of various nanostructures, e.g., the magnetic properties of complex spin systems. The observed excited states can be of magnetic and vibrational origin and it is therefore necessary to differentiate between these two excitation mechanisms. Here, we investigate the spin S = 1/2 phenalenyl radical on Au(111). IETS measurements feature inelastic excitations, whereas the spatial distribution of their intensity excludes any spin excitations. Comparison to theoretical simulations proves the vibrational origin of those excitations and allows us to assign the observed features to distinct vibrational modes.

Abstract: Topological spin textures in magnetic materials beyond two-dimensional skyrmions have attracted attention for electronics beyond CMOS technologies. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) topological spin textures are promising due to the expected complex non-linear dynamics as well as high static and dynamic thermal stability. In multilayer heterostructures, a hybrid chiral skyrmion tube is a well-known example of a 3D topological spin texture, exhibiting an intriguing chirality transition along the thickness direction. This transition progresses from left-handed to right-handed N\'eel-type chirality, passing through a Bloch-type intermediate state. Such an exotic spin configuration potentially exhibits distinctly different dynamics from that of the common skyrmion tube that exhibits a homogeneous chirality; yet these dynamics have not been ascertained so far. Here we reveal the distinct features of current-induced dynamics that result from the hybrid chiral skyrmion tube structure in synthetic antiferromagnetic (SyAFM) multilayers. Strikingly, the SyAFM hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes exhibit a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall effect in the flow regime. The non-reciprocity can even be tuned by the degree of magnetic compensation in the SyAFM systems. Our theoretical modeling qualitatively corroborates that the non-reciprocity stems from the dynamic oscillation of skyrmion helicity during its current-induced motion. The findings highlight the critical role of the internal degrees of freedom of these complex skyrmion tubes for their current-induced dynamics.

arXiv:2411.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the magnetic ground states of frustrated antiferromagnets provides unique insight into the stability of quantum spin liquids, even if the anticipated state is not realized towards T = 0. Particularly relevant are structural modifications setting in at temperatures where the magnetic correlations come into play. Here we explore the lattice dynamics of Y-kapellasite (Y3Cu9(OH)19Cl8) single crystals by infrared spectroscopy in combination with ab initio calculations. We observe significant changes in the phonon spectra at Ts = 32 K, that gradually evolve down to low temperatures. The increase in the number of phonon modes provides evidence for a lowering of symmetry and we discuss several possibilities of crystal structure modifications. Our analysis also reveals that the structural variation involves exclusively H and O atoms, while the other atoms remain rather unaffected. An 8% red shift of the lowest-lying phonon mode upon cooling indicates strong magneto-elastic effects upon decoupling Cu-6f hexagons through the lattice vibrations.

arXiv:2411.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum acoustic framework has recently emerged as a non-perturbative, coherent approach to electron-lattice interactions, uncovering rich physics often obscured by perturbative methods with incoherent scattering events. Here, we model the coupled dynamics of electrons and acoustic lattice vibrations within this framework, representing lattice vibrations as coherent states and electrons as quantum wavepackets. We derive and numerically implement electron backaction on the lattice, providing both visual and quantitative insights into electron wavepacket evolution, self-trapping, and the formation of small acoustic polarons. We investigate polaron binding energies across varying material parameters and compute key observables-including mean square displacement, kinetic energy, potential energy, and vibrational energy-over time. Our findings reveal the conditions that favor polaron formation, which is enhanced by low temperatures, high deformation potential constants, slow sound velocities, high effective masses, and small Fermi surfaces. Additionally, we explore the impact of external electric and magnetic fields, showing that while polaron formation remains robust under moderate fields, it is weakly suppressed at higher field strengths. These results deepen our understanding of polaron dynamics and pave the way for future studies into non-trivial transport behavior in quantum materials.

# Altermagnetic multiferroics and altermagnetoelectric effect

arXiv:2411.19928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics are highly sought after for applications in low-power electronics and for advancing fundamental research, including axion insulators and dark matter detection. However, achieving a combination of ferroic spin and electric orders, along with their controllable switching, remains a significant challenge in conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Here, we present first-principles evidence that time-reversal symmetry-breaking altermagnetic spin polarization with relatively high critical temperatures can emerge in ferroelectrics BaCuF$_4$ (T$_N$ $\sim$ 275K) and Ca$_3$Mn$_2$O$_7$ (T$_N$ $\sim$ 110K). Furthermore, we classify all possible altermagnetic polar spin groups, revealing altermagnetism in a collinear phase of BiFeO$_3$. We also propose an altermagnetoelectric effect, a nonrelativistic cross-coupling between altermagnetic spin polarization and ferroelectric polarization, mediated by a rotation of nonmagnetic polyhedra in the lattice structure. Our findings suggest an alternative pathway towards high-temperature magnetoelectric multiferroicity and the electric field control of altermagnetic order parameters.

Abstract: While experimental measurements of photon correlations have become routine in laboratories, theoretical access to these quantities for the light generated in complex nanophotonic devices remains a major challenge. Current methods are limited to specific simplified cases and lack generality. Here we present a novel method that provides access to photon statistics resolved in space and frequency in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. Within the macroscopic QED framework, we develop a practical tool to compute electric field correlations for complex quantum systems by including lossy two-level systems that act as field detectors within the system. To make the implementation feasible, we use a recently developed multi-emitter few-mode quantization method to correctly account for fully retarded light propagation to the detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique by studying the photon correlations of one and two emitters in close proximity to a plasmonic nanoparticle. The simulations show that even in these relatively simple configurations, the light statistics exhibit a strong angular dependence. These results highlight the importance of going beyond conventional quantum-optical approaches to fully capture the analyzed physical effects and enable the study of the quantum light generation in realistic nanophotonic devices.

Abstract: Theoretical calculations show that twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) under a transverse electric field develops a valley Chern number 2 at charge neutrality. Using thermodynamic and thermal activation measurements we report the experimental observation of a universal closing of the charge neutrality gap in the Hofstadter spectrum of TDBG at 1/2 magnetic flux per unit cell, in agreement with theoretical predictions for a valley Chern number 2 gap. Our theoretical analysis of the experimental data shows that the interaction energy, while larger than the flat-band bandwidth in TDBG near 1\deg does not alter the emergent valley symmetry or the single-particle band topology.

Abstract: Using the rigid dipole model, we study the translational and rotational motions of single-domain fer-romagnetic nanoparticles in a dilute suspension induced by the harmonically oscillating gradient magnetic field in the presence of a time-independent uniform magnetic field. Our approach is based on a set of the first-order differential equations that describe the time dependencies of the particle coordinate and mag-netization angle. We find the asymptotic solutions of this set of equations at small and large times and, by applying the matched asymptotic expansions for discrete times, derive analytical expressions for the aver-age particle coordinate and velocity.

Abstract: Particles in a crowded environment exhibit slow anomalous diffusion, and their efficient manipulation is important in controlling transport phenomena in complex materials. Skyrmions and half-skyrmions, spatially localized quasiparticles observed in magnetic systems and liquid crystals, also exhibit diffusive motion. They exhibit normal diffusion in dilute conditions. However, the cooperative dynamics and diffusion of skyrmions and half-skyrmions in their condensed liquid, hexatic, and crystalline phases are elusive. Here we show in the half-skyrmion condensed phases that the fusion and fission of half-skyrmions, not their diffusion, are responsible for the primary structural relaxation. The fusion and fission occur due to the non-conserved nature of the quasiparticle number density. The diffusion, which contributes to the secondary structural relaxation, is suppressed by cages formed by surrounding half-skyrmions, whereas enhanced by Mermin-Wagner fluctuation characteristic to two-dimensional systems, leading to subdiffusive motion. Large displacement of half-skyrmions is locally excited by fusion-fission and bond-breaking between adjacent half-skyrmions via heterogeneous elastic fields. Furthermore, the motion of half-skyrmions couples with transverse and longitudinal sound wave excitation differently, where the transverse sound wave is more attenuated than the longitudinal one due to the coupling between transverse sound wave and half-skyrmion deformation. We also discuss the {relationship} between half-skyrmion diffusion in our system and skyrmion diffusion in magnetic systems. Our result provides a qualitative difference in dynamical properties between half-skyrmion gaseous and condensed phases, suggesting the efficient manipulation of high-density half-skyrmions and skyrmions.

Abstract: Ferromagnets with high spin polarization are known to be valuable for spintronics--a research field that exploits the spin degree of freedom in information technologies. Recently, antiferromagnets have emerged as promising alternative materials for spintronics due to their stability against magnetic perturbations, absence of stray fields, and ultrafast dynamics. For antiferromagnets,however, the concept of spin polarization and its relevance to the measured electrical response are elusive due to nominally zero net magnetization.Here, we define an effective momentum-dependent spin polarization and reveal an unexpected property of many noncollinear antiferromagnets to exhibit nearly 100% spin polarization in a broad area of the Fermi surface. This property leads to the emergence of an extraordinary tunneling magnetoresistance (ETMR) effect in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs). As a representative example, we predict that a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn$_{3}$GaN exhibits nearly 100% spin-polarized states that can efficiently tunnel through low-decay-rate evanescent states of perovskite oxide SrTiO$_{3}$ resulting in ETMR as large as $10^{4}$%. Our results uncover hidden functionality of material systems with noncollinear spin textures and open new perspectives for spintronics.

Abstract: We map out the ground state phase diagram of the isotropic Kekule'-Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of the Heisenberg exchange couplings. Our study relies on large-scale tensor network simulations based on graph-based projected entangled pair state (gPEPS) approach in the thermodynamic limit. We find that on top of the quantum spin liquid (QSL) and conventional magnetically ordered phases which are typical of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, the Kekule'-Heisenberg phase diagram, hosts two plaquette valance bond solid (VBS) phases with vanishing magnetic order. While the VBS phases preserve the symmetries of the original Hamiltonian, they differ markedly from the Kitaev spin liquid by having decorated plaquette ordering which is distinguished by a plaquette order parameter.

Abstract: In the pseudogap phase of the cuprate, a thermal Hall response of neutral objects has been recently detected experimentally, which continuously persists into the antiferromagnetic insulating phase. In this work, we study the transport properties of neutral spinons as the elementary excitation of a doped Mott insulator, which is governed by a mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge structure. We show that such a chiral spinon as a composite of an $S=1/2$ spin sitting at the core of a supercurrent vortex, can contribute to the thermal Hall effect, thermopower, and Hall effect due to its intrinsic transverse (cyclotron) motion under internal fictitious fluxes. In particular, the magnitudes of the transport coefficients are phenomenologically determined by two basic parameters: the doping concentration and $T_c$, quantitatively consistent with the experimental measurements including the signs and qualitative temperature and magnetic field dependence. Combined with the predictions of the spinon longitudinal transport properties, including the Nernst and spin Hall effects, a phenomenological description of the pseudogap phase is established as characterized by the neutral spinon excitations, which eventually become "confined" with an intrinsic superconducting transition at $T_c$. Finally, within this theoretical framework, the "order to order" phase transition between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic insulating phases are briefly discussed, with the thermal Hall monotonically increasing into the latter.

Abstract: Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional substitutional disorder. We conduct a finite-size scaling analysis on the observed reentrant phases to identify critical points, determine associated critical exponents, and examine the scaling behavior linked to localization transitions. Additionally, we explore the parameter space to identify the conditions under which the reentrant phases occur. Described within a tight-binding framework, present work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry. Potential applications and experimental realizations of RL phenomena are also explored.

Abstract: The inherent complexity of system-bath interactions often requires making critical approximations, which we here show to have a radical influence on the renormalization group flow and the resulting phase diagram. Specifically, for the Caldeira-Leggett model Schmid and Bulgadaev (SB) predicted a phase transition, whose experimental verification in resistive superconducting circuits is currently hotly debated. For normal metal and Josephson junction array resistors, we show that the mapping to Caldeira-Leggett is only exact when applying approximations which decompactify the superconducting phase. We show that there exist treatments that retain phase compactness, which immediately lead to a phase diagram depending on four instead of two parameters. While we still find an SB-like transition in the transmon regime, the critical parameter is controlled exclusively by the capacitive coupling. In contrast, the Cooper pair box maps to the anisotropic Kondo model, where a pseudoferromagnetic phase is not allowed for regular electrostatic interactions.

Abstract: Altermagnets are compensated magnets belonging to spin symmetry groups that allow alternating spin polarizations both in the coordinate space of the crystal and in the momentum space of the electronic structure. In these materials the anisotropic local crystal environment of the different sublattices lowers the symmetry of the system so that the opposite-spin sublattices are connected only by rotations, which results in an unconventional spin-polarized band structure in the momentum space. This low symmetry of the crystal structure is expected to be reflected in the anisotropy of the anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we study the anisotropy of the anomalous Hall effect in epitaxial thin films of Mn$_5$Si$_3$, an altermagnetic candidate material. We first demonstrate a change in the relative N\'eel vector orientation when rotating the external field orientation through systematic changes in both the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic longitudinal magnetoresistance. We then show that the anomalous Hall effect in this material is anisotropic with the N\'eel vector orientation relative to the crystal structure and that this anisotropy requires high crystal quality and unlikely correlates with the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Our results provide further systematic support to the case for considering epitaxial thin films of Mn$_5$Si$_3$ as an altermagnetic candidate material.

Abstract: We describe an integrated modelling approach to accelerate the search for novel, single-phase, multicomponent materials with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA). For a given system we predict the nature of atomic ordering, its dependence on the magnetic state, and then proceed to describe the consequent MCA, magnetisation, and magnetic critical temperature (Curie temperature). Crucially, within our modelling framework, the same ab initio description of the material's electronic structure determines all aspects. We demonstrate this holistic method by studying the effects of alloying additions in FeNi, examining systems with the general stoichiometries Fe$_4$Ni$_3X$ and Fe$_3$Ni$_4X$, for additives including X= Pt, Pd, Al, and Co. The atomic ordering behaviour predicted on adding these elements, fundamental for determining a material's MCA, is rich and varied. Equiatomic FeNi has been reported to require ferromagnetic order to establish the tetragonal L10 order suited for significant MCA. Our results show that when alloying additions are included in this material, annealing in an applied magnetic field and/or below a material's Curie temperature may also promote tetragonal order, along with an appreciable effect on the predicted hard magnetic properties.

arXiv:2403.01171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical physics, one of the standard methods to study second order phase transitions is the renormalization group that usually leads to an expansion around the corresponding fully connected solution. Unfortunately, often in disordered models, some important finite dimensional second-order phase transitions are qualitatively different or absent in the corresponding fully connected model: in such cases the standard expansion fails. Recently, a new method, the $M$-layer one, has been introduced that performs an expansion around a different soluble mean field model: the Bethe lattice one. This new method has been already used to compute the upper critical dimension $D_U$ of different disordered systems such as the Random Field Ising model or the Spin glass model with field. If then one wants to go beyond and construct an expansion around $D_U$ to understand how critical quantities get renormalized, the actual computation of all the numerical factors is needed. This next step has still not been performed, being technically more involved. In this paper we perform this computation for the ferromagnetic Ising model without quenched disorder, in finite dimensions: we show that, at one-loop order inside the $M$-layer approach, we recover the continuum quartic field theory and we are able to identify the coupling constant $g$ and the other parameters of the theory, as a function of macroscopic and microscopic details of the model such as the lattice spacing, the physical lattice dimension and the temperature. This is a fundamental step that will help in applying in the future the same techniques to more complicated systems, for which the standard field theoretical approach is impracticable.

Abstract: Trapped ions in a periodic potential are a paradigm of a frustrated Wigner crystal. The dynamics is captured by a long-range Frenkel-Kontorova model. The classical ground state can be mapped to the one of an antiferromagnetic spin chain with long-range interactions in a magnetic field, whose strength is determined by the mismatch between chain's and substrate lattice's periodicity. The mapping is exact when the substrate potential is a piecewise harmonic potential and holds for any two-body interaction decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ with the distance $r$. The ground state is a devil's staircase of regular, periodic structures as a function of the mismatch, whose range of stability depends also on the coefficient $\alpha$. While the staircase is well defined in the thermodynamic limit for $\alpha>1$, for Coulomb interactions, $\alpha=1$, it disappears and the sliding-to-pinned transitions becomes crossovers. However, due to the logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit characteristic of the Coulomb potential, the staircase is found for any finite number of ions. We discuss the experimental parameters as well as the features that allow one to observe and reveal our predictions in experimental platforms. These dynamics are a showcase of the versatility of trapped ion platforms for exploring the interplay between frustration and interactions.

Abstract: We study the phase behaviour of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy. Our approach is based on a perturbative analysis of the internal energy of the paramagnetic solid solution as evaluated within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker formulation of density functional theory, using the coherent potential approximation to average over disorder. Via application of a Landau-type linear response theory, we infer preferential chemical orderings directly. In addition, we recover a pairwise form of the alloy internal energy suitable for study via atomistic simulations, which in this work are performed using the nested sampling algorithm, which is well-suited for studying complex potential energy surfaces. When the underlying lattice is fcc, at low concentrations of Al, depending on the value of $x$, we predict either an $\mathrm{L}1_2$ or $\mathrm{D}0_{22}$ ordering emerging below approximately 1000 K. On the other hand, when the underlying lattice is bcc, consistent with experimental observations, we predict $\mathrm{B}2$ ordering temperatures higher than the melting temperature of the alloy, confirming that this ordered phase forms directly from the melt. For both fcc and bcc systems, chemical orderings are dominated by Al moving to one sublattice, Ni and Co the other, while Cr and Fe remain comparatively disordered. On the bcc lattice, our atomistic modelling suggests eventual decomposition into $\mathrm{B}2$ NiAl and Cr-rich phases. These results shed light on the fundamental physical origins of atomic ordering tendencies in these intriguing materials.

Abstract: The dispersion relation of spin waves can vary monotonically about the center of the Brillouin zone, allowing zero-momentum wavepackets to flow unidirectionally, which is of interest for applications. Techniques such as propagating spin wave spectroscopy are inoperative in such cases because of the difficulty to identify the spin wave wavevector at a particular frequency within a spectrum. Here we present a method to analyse this case and apply it to acoustic spin waves in a synthetic antiferromagnet in the scissors state, in which we confirm that propagation parallel to the applied fields is unidirectional. Interestingly, we find that in this unidirectional situation, the phase accumulated by the spin waves propagating between two antenna is not proportional to the antenna spacing. It is also a function of the two other lengths of the problem: the antenna width and the spin wave decay length. Accounting for them is required to avoid wavevector errors in the dispersion relations.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic properties of $S=1$ antiferromagnetic diamond lattice, Ni$X_{2}$(pyrimidine)$_{2}$ ($X$ = Cl, Br), hosting a single-ion anisotropy (SIA) orientation which alternates between neighbouring sites. Through neutron diffraction measurements of the $X$ = Cl compound, the ordered state spins are found to align collinearly along a pseudo-easy-axis, a unique direction created by the intersection of two easy planes. Similarities in the magnetization, exhibiting spin-flop transitions, and the magnetic susceptibility in the two compounds imply that the same magnetic structure and a pseudo-easy-axis is also present for $X$ = Br. We estimate the Hamiltonian parameters by combining analytical calculations and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of the spin-flop and saturation field. The MC simulations also reveal that the spin-flop transition occurs when the applied field is parallel to the pseudo-easy-axis. Contrary to conventional easy-axis systems, there exist field directions perpendicular to the pseudo-easy-axis for which the magnetic saturation is approached asymptotically and no symmetry-breaking phase transition is observed at finite fields.

Abstract: Flat band (FB) systems, featuring dispersionless energy bands, have garnered significant interest due to their compact localized states (CLSs). However, a detailed account on how local impurities affect the physical properties of overlapping CLSs is still missing. Here we study a diamond chain with a finite magnetic flux per plaquette that exhibits a gapped midspectrum FB with non-orthogonal CLSs, and develop a framework for projecting operators onto such non-orthogonal bases. This framework is applied to the case of an open diamond chain with small local impurities in the midchain plaquette, and analytical expressions are derived for FB states influenced by these impurities. For equal impurities in top and bottom sites under diagonal disorder, we show how the impurity states experience an averaged disorder dependent on their spatial extension, leading to enhanced robustness against disorder. For a single impurity, an exotic topological phase with a half-integer winding number is discovered, which is linked to a single in-gap edge state under open boundary conditions. Numerical simulations validate the analytical predictions.

Abstract: For a Weyl semimetal (WSM) in a magnetic field, a semiclassical description of the Fermi-arc surface state dynamics is usually employed for explaining various unconventional magnetotransport phenomena, e.g., Weyl orbits, the three-dimensional Quantum Hall Effect, and the high transmission through twisted WSM interfaces. For a half-space geometry, we determine the low-energy quantum eigenstates for a four-band model of a WSM in a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface. The eigenstates correspond to in- and out-going chiral Landau level (LL) states, propagating (anti-)parallel to the field direction near different Weyl nodes, which are coupled by evanescent surface-state contributions generated by all other LLs. These replace the Fermi arc in a magnetic field. Computing the phase shift accumulated between in- and out-going chiral LL states, we compare our quantum-mechanical results to semiclassical predictions. We find quantitative agreement between both approaches.

Abstract: Materials composed of spin-1 antiferromagnetic (AFM) chains are known to adopt complex ground states which are sensitive to the single-ion-anisotropy (SIA) energy ($D$), and intrachain ($J_{0}$) and interchain ($J'_{i}$) exchange energy scales. While theoretical and experimental studies have extended this model to include various other energy scales, the effect of the lack of a common SIA axis is not well explored. Here we investigate the magnetic properties of Ni(pyrimidine)(H$_{2}$O)$_{2}$(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, a chain compound where the tilting of Ni octahedra leads to a 2-fold alternation of the easy-axis directions along the chain. Muon-spin relaxation measurements indicate a transition to long-range order at $T_{\text{N}}=2.3$\,K and the magnetic structure is initially determined to be antiferromagnetic and collinear using elastic neutron diffraction experiments. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were used to find $J_{0} = 5.107(7)$\,K, $D = 2.79(1)$\,K, $J'_{2}=0.18(3)$\,K and a rhombic anisotropy energy $E=0.19(9)$\,K. Mean-field modelling reveals that the ground state structure hosts spin canting of $\phi\approx6.5^{\circ}$, which is not detectable above the noise floor of the elastic neutron diffraction data. Monte-Carlo simulation of the powder-averaged magnetization, $M(H)$, is then used to confirm these Hamiltonian parameters, while single-crystal $M(H)$ simulations provide insight into features observed in the data.

Abstract: Magnon based spintronic devices require the modulation of magnon spin transport for their operations. We provide a proof-of-principle of an unconventional two-terminal non-local magnon transport device where the same contact is simultaneously used as injector and gate and an unconventional three-terminal non-local magnon transport device where the gate is positioned outside the magnon transport channel. In these devices we modulate the diffusive magnon transport of incoherent magnons in the van der Waals antiferromagnet Chromium thiophosphate, CrPS4. The non-local signals generated electrically by spin injection via the spin Hall effect (SHE) and thermally via the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) are altered by a modulator electrode. The current through the modulator increases or decreases the magnon chemical potential via the SHE and changes the magnon temperature through Joule heating. We achieve up to 25%/mA and 16%/mA modulation efficiencies for the electrically and thermally generated magnon spin transport, respectively, for CrPS4 in the collinear state at in plane fields >7T at a temperature of 25K.

# Ternary nickel hydrides: a new platform for unconventional superconductivity and quantum magnetism

Abstract: In this letter, we propose ternary nickel hydrides MNiH2 (M = Li, Na) as new materials that mimic cuprate physics but have important differences and interesting properties. Ni-H bands are wider than in oxides due to shorter bond lengths and covalency is larger than in Ni oxides which leads to a large scale of magnetic interactions. The charge transfer energy is smaller than in LaNiO2 which in cuprates translates to a larger Tc. We notice the formation of the electride band close to the Fermi surface which appears due to H vacancy along the c lattice vector. The considerable difference with cuprates arises from dz2 orbitals hybridization with interstitial orbitals allowing charge transfer to an apical vacancy state and self-doping the cuprate like Ni dx2-y2 H s antibonding bands which suggests that stoichiometric NaNiH2 may already be metallic and superconducting.

Abstract: We revisit the challenging problem of identifying the quantum spin liquid candidate in the spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. By integrating the Gutzwiller-guided density matrix renormalization group method with analytical analyses, we present clear evidence that the ground state is a Z$_2$ Dirac spin liquid. This state can be efficiently described by a Gutzwiller-projected parton theory characterized by its projective symmetry group. To distinguish the difference between the projected Z$_2$ and U(1) parton state, we investigate the chiral spin liquid ground states as topological orders by incorporating a $J_\chi$ term into the $J_1$-$J_2$ model and observe a transition from a Z$_2$ chiral spin liquid to a U(1)$_2$ chiral spin liquid as $J_\chi$ increases.

Abstract: We investigate the second-order photon correlation function in cavity-magnon systems, focusing on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities within the ultra-strong coupling regime, and extending beyond the rotating-wave approximation. By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhance the squeezing effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode without increasing cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in antiferromagnetic case, magnon modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and imposes a lower bound on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon blockade and quantum information processing in magnon-cavity systems in the ultrastrong coupling limit.

Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.

arXiv:2409.16616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Feibelman $d$-parameter, a mesoscopic complement to the local bulk permittivity, describes quantum optical surface responses for interfaces, including nonlocality, spill-in and-out, and surface-enabled Landau damping. It has been incorporated into the macroscopic Maxwellian framework for convenient modeling and understanding of nanoscale electromagnetic phenomena, calling for the compilation of a $d$-parameter database for interfaces of interest in nano-optics. However, accurate first-principles calculations of $d$-parameters face computational challenges, whereas existing measurements of $d$-parameters are scarce and restricted to narrow spectral windows. We demonstrate a general broadband ellipsometric approach to measure $d$-parameters at a gold--air interface across the visible--ultraviolet regimes. Gold is found to spill in and spill out at different frequencies. We also observe gold's Bennett mode, a surface-dipole resonance associated with a pole of the $d$-parameter, around 2.5 eV. Our measurements give rise to and are further validated by the passivity and Kramers--Kronig causality analysis of $d$-parameters. Our work advances the understanding of quantum surface response and may enable applications like enhanced electron field emission.

arXiv:2411.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maxwell's equations, a system of linear partial differential equations (PDEs), describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in time and space and is essential for many important electromagnetic applications. Although numerical methods have been applied successfully in the past, the primary challenge in solving these equations arises from the frequency of electromagnetic fields, which depends on the shape and size of the objects to be resolved. The frequency dictates the grid size used for the spatial discretization of the PDEs. Since the domain of influence for these equations is compactly supported, even a small perturbation in frequency necessitates a new discretization of Maxwell's equations, resulting in substantial computational costs. In this work, we investigate the potential of neural operators, particularly the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and its variants, as a surrogate model for Maxwell's equations. Existing DeepONet implementations are restricted to real-valued data in $\mathbb{R}^n$, but since the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations yield solutions in the complex domain $\mathbb{C}^n$, a specialized architecture is required to handle complex algebra. We propose a formulation of DeepONet for complex data, define the forward pass in the complex domain, and adopt a reparametrized version of DeepONet for more efficient training. We also propose a unified framework to combine a plurality of DeepONets, trained for multiple electromagnetic field components, to incorporate the boundary condition. As shown by computational experiments, our method significantly enhances the efficiency of predicting scattered fields from a spherical object at arbitrary high frequencies.

# Direct comparison of the energization of self-consistent charged particles vs test particles in a turbulent plasma

arXiv:2411.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The test particle approach is a widely used method for studying the dynamics of charged particles in complex electromagnetic fields and has been successful in explaining particle energization in turbulent plasmas. However, this approach is fundamentally not self-consistent, as test particles do not generate their own electromagnetic fields and therefore do not interact with their surroundings realistically. In this work, we compare the energization of a population of test protons in a magnetofluid to that of a plasma composed of self-consistent particles. We use a compressible Hall magnetohydrodynamic (CHMHD) model for the test particle case and a hybrid particle-in-cell (HPIC) approach for the self-consistent case, conducting both 2D and 3D simulations. We calculate the rate of energization and conversion to thermal energy in both models, finding a higher temperature for the test particle case. Additionally, we examine the distribution of suprathermal particles and find that, in the test particle scenario, these particles eventually occupy the entire domain, while in the self-consistent case, suprathermal particles are confined to specific regions. We conclude that while test particles capture some qualitative features of their self-consistent counterparts, they miss finer phenomena and tend to overestimate energization.

Abstract: Metasurface anomalous reflectors can enhance future wireless communication systems due to their ability to redirect electromagnetic waves and establish metasurface-assisted communication links. However, metasurface reflectors typically suffer from chromatic aberrations with the reflected angle shifting as the frequency varies. Herein, we design achromatic metasurfaces for anomalous reflection by using an integral-equation framework that fully accounts for the frequency dispersion of the individual scatterers (unit cells). Rather than engineering the dispersion of each metasurface cell locally, we harness the emerging near-field interactions (evanescent waves) between the scatterers to realize anomalous reflection at a fixed angle over a wide frequency range. Three anomalous reflectors are designed and experimentally verified at 10GHz, demonstrating high performance metrics compared to traditional achromatic reflectors, while employing simple, low-profile unit cells. The presented results pave an effective way to realize achromatic wave functionalities, such as anomalous reflection, refraction or lensing, over a wide bandwidth with low-profile and highly efficient metasurfaces.

arXiv:2411.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittency as it occurs in fast dynamos in the MHD framework is evaluated through the examination of relations between normalized moments at third order (skewness S) and fourth order (kurtosis K) for both the velocity and magnetic field, and for their local dissipations. As investigated by several authors in various physical contexts such as fusion plasmas (Krommes (2008)), climate evolution (Sura & Sardeshmukh (2008)), fluid turbulence or rotating stratified flows (Pouquet et al. (2023)), approximate parabolic K(S) ~ alpha laws emerge whose origin may be related to the applicability of intermittency models to their dynamics. The results analyzed herein are obtained through direct numerical simulations of MHD flows for both Taylor-Green and Beltrami ABC forcing at moderate Reynolds numbers, and for up to 314000 turn-over times. We observe for the dissipation 0.2 < alpha <3.0, an evaluation that varies with the field, the forcing, and when filtering for high-skewness intermittent structures. When using the She & Leveque (1994) intermittency model, one can compute alpha analytically; we then find alpha = 2.5, clearly differing from a (strict) parabolic scaling, a result consistent with the numerical data.

Abstract: We report on measurements of 1 and 1.5 MeV monoenergetic electrons with a Timepix3-based detector using a 0.5 mm thick silicon sensor. A $^{90}$Sr $\beta$-emitting radioisotope was used as the source of electrons, and a monochromator equipped with an adjustable magnetic field was employed to only pass electrons of desired energy into the detector. We provide experimental results of deposited-energy spectrum in the sensor and linearity of detected tracks. Alongside with the experiment, the whole system has been modelled in software and a Monte Carlo Geant4 / Allpix$^2$ simulation of the experiment has been carried out. Generally, we find a good agreement between the two.

Abstract: Electromagnetic whistler-mode waves play a crucial role in the acceleration and precipitation of radiation belt electrons. Statistical surveys of wave characteristics suggest that these waves should preferentially scatter and precipitate relativistic electrons on the day side. However, the night-side region is expected to be primarily associated with electron acceleration. The recent low-altitude observations reveal relativistic electron precipitation in the night-side region. In this paper, we present statistical surveys of night-side relativistic electron losses due to intense precipitation bursts. We demonstrate that such bursts are associated with storm time substorm injections and are likely related to relativistic electron scattering by ducted whistler-mode waves. We also speculate on the role of injections in creating conditions favorable for relativistic electron precipitation.

Abstract: The contribution of a time-independent toroidally-symmetric radial electric field $E_r$ is implemented in VisualStart [Comp. Phys. Comm. 275 (2022) 108305; arXiv:2111.08224], a code whose purposes include the construction of guiding center (GC) drift orbit databases for the study of plasma instabilities in tokamaks. $E_r$ is important for the thermal part of the velocity distribution and for fast particle resonances in the kHz frequency range. KSTAR, JT-60U and ITER tokamak cases are used as working examples to test our methods and discuss practical issues connected with $E_r$. Two points are worth noting: First, the GC orbit space is sampled in the magnetic midplane as before, and we find that in the presence of $E_r$, midplane-based coordinates are not only equivalent but superior to conventional constants of motion, allowing to attain high numerical accuracy and efficiency with a relatively simple mesh. Second, the periodic parallel acceleration and deceleration of GCs via the mirror force is modulated by $E_r$. Although this parallel electric acceleration averages to zero during a poloidal transit (or bounce) period, it has important consequences, one being the known shift of the trapped-passing boundary. Another consequence is that electric frequency shifts depend on the chosen reference point, so that some care is required when evaluating the $E_r$-dependence of transit frequencies for resonance analyses.

# Artifact Correction in Magnetic Resonance Temperature Imaging for Laser Interstitial Thermotherapy with Multi-echo Acquisitions

## 通过多回波采集在磁共振温度成像中进行激光间质热疗的伪影校正

arXiv:2411.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In MRI-guided laser interstitial thermotherapy (MRgLITT), a signal void sometimes appears at the heating center of the measured temperature map. In neurosurgical MRgLITT treatments, cerebrospinal fluid pulsation (CSF), which may lead to temperature artifacts, also needs to be carefully managed. We find that signal loss in MR magnitude images can be one distinct contributor to the temperature imaging signal void. Therefore, this study aims to investigate this finding and more importantly. Also, this study intends to improve measurement accuracy by correcting CSF-induced temperature errors and employing a more reliable phase unwrapping algorithm. A gradient echo sequence with certain TE values for temperature imaging is used to quantify T2* variations during MRgLITT and to investigate the development of signal voids throughout the treatment. Informed by these findings, a multi-echo GRE sequence with appropriate TE coverage is employed. A multi-echo-based correction algorithm is developed to address the signal loss-induced temperature errors. A new phase unwrapping method and a new CSF pulsation correction approach are developed for multi-echo signal processing. The temperature imaging method is evaluated by gel phantom, ex-vivo, and in-vivo LITT heating experiments. T2* shortening during heating can be one important cause of the temperate imaging signal voids and this demands the multi-echo acquisition with varied TE values. The proposed multi-echo-based method can effectively correct signal loss-induced temperature errors and raise temperature estimation precision. The multi-echo thermometry in the in-vivo experiments shows smoother hotspot boundaries, fewer artifacts, and improved thermometry reliability. In the in-vivo experiments, the ablation areas estimated from the multi-echo thermometry also show satisfactory agreement with those determined from post-ablation MR imaging.

arXiv:2411.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a frequency tunable magneto-acoustic oscillator (MAO) operating in low-phase-noise and complex dynamical regimes based on a single composite YIG-GGG resonator. The magneto-acoustic resonator (MAR) is based on a YIG (yttrium iron garnet) layer epitaxially grown on a GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet) substrate. By optimizing the YIG thickness, we obtain a high magneto-elastic coupling of around 1 MHz between the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in YIG and high overtone acoustic resonances (HBARs) in the YIG-GGG structure in the 1-2 GHz frequency range. It allows to eliminate the need for pre-selectors and bulky circulators, thus simplifying the MAO design while maintaining the possibility to lock to HBAR YIG-GGG modes. With an adjustment in the loop over-amplification parameter, the MAO can be locked either only to high-Q magneto-acoustic HBARs or to both types of resonance including HBARs and the FMR mode of the YIG film. In a low-phase-noise regime, MAO generates only at certain values of the applied field and exhibits discrete frequency tunability with a 3.281 MHz step corresponding to the frequency separation between the adjacent HBAR modes in a YIG-GGG structure. In a complex regime where oscillation conditions expand to include both HBAR and FMR modes, MAO demonstrates continuous generation as the function of the applied field with variable phase noise parameters. Moreover, in low-phase-noise regime, MAO phase noise plot improves by 30 dB compared to the operational regime locked to the pure FMR in YIG which is in agreement with the measured FMR and HBAR Q-factors.

# Normal Mode Splitting and Force Sensing in Cavity Magnomechanical System

arXiv:2411.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of system composed of a single cavity consisting of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and a YIG sphere influenced by a bias magnetic field. This bias field leads to magnetostrictive effects on magnon modes that induces phonons. We investigate the position fluctuation spectrum and the output field spectrum, finding that at G =0, the system displays a single peak, indicative of weak coupling between the optical and phononic modes. As G increases (e.g., G =0.1 kappa_a, 0.2 kappa_a, 0.4 kappa_a, we observe a transition to double peak, which reflects stronger coupling in the vicinity of cavity along with phonon modes that leads to normal mode splitting (NMS) in cavity magnomechanic system. Furthermore, we examine that the OPA amplifies the Y quadrature while squeezing the X quadrature of the output field spectrum. This sensitive behavior results in a more pronounced splitting in the Y quadrature spectra compared to the X quadrature. Our findings emphasize the essential role of the OPA in adjusting the interaction strength between the optical and phononic modes as well as underscore the importance of quadrature analysis in characterizing the system's response. NMS mechanism open avenues for advanced applications in quantum sensing and information processing, highlighting the potential for tunable devices in emerging quantum technologies.

Abstract: Integrating 2D mammography with 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for improving breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. However, this integration is challenging due to differences in imaging modalities and the need for precise tissue segmentation and alignment. This paper addresses these challenges by enhancing biomechanical breast models in two main aspects: improving tissue identification using nnU-Net segmentation models and evaluating finite element (FE) biomechanical solvers, specifically comparing NiftySim and FEBio. We performed a detailed six-class segmentation of breast MRI data using the nnU-Net architecture, achieving Dice Coefficients of 0.94 for fat, 0.88 for glandular tissue, and 0.87 for pectoral muscle. The overall foreground segmentation reached a mean Dice Coefficient of 0.83 through an ensemble of 2D and 3D U-Net configurations, providing a solid foundation for 3D reconstruction and biomechanical modeling. The segmented data was then used to generate detailed 3D meshes and develop biomechanical models using NiftySim and FEBio, which simulate breast tissue's physical behaviors under compression. Our results include a comparison between NiftySim and FEBio, providing insights into the accuracy and reliability of these simulations in studying breast tissue responses under compression. The findings of this study have the potential to improve the integration of 2D and 3D imaging modalities, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for breast cancer.

Abstract: Magnetic-free optomechanically induced nonreciprocity may stimulate a wide range of practical applications in quantum technologies. However, how to suppress the thermal noise flow from the mechanical reservoir is still a difficulty encountered in achieving optomechanically nonreciprocal effects on a few- and even single-photon level. Here, we show how to realize thermal noise cancellation by quantum interference for optomechanically induced nonreciprocity in a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonator. We find that both nonreciprocal transmission and amplification can be achieved in the WGM microresonator when it coupled to two coupled mechanical resonators. More interestingly, the thermal noise can be suppressed when the two coupled mechanical resonators couple to a common thermal reservoir. The thermal noise cancellation is induced by the destructive quantum interference between the two flow paths of the thermal noises from the common reservoir. The scheme of quantum interference induced thermal noise cancellation can be applied in both sideband resolved and unresolved regimes, even with strong backscattering taken into account. Our work provides an effective way to achieve nonreciprocal effects on a few- or single-photon level without precooling the mechanical mode to the ground state.

Abstract: This paper aims to present the time-dependent coupling between the coronal model COolfluid COroNal UnsTructured (COCONUT) and the heliospheric forecasting tool EUHFORIA.
  We perform six COCONUT simulations where a flux rope is implemented at the solar surface using either the Titov-D\'emoulin CME model or the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL) CME model. At regular intervals, the magnetic field, velocity, temperature, and density of the 2D surface $R_{b}=21.5~\;R_{\odot}$ are saved in boundary files. This series of coupling files is read in a modified version of EUHFORIA to update progressively its inner boundary. After presenting the early stage of the propagation in COCONUT, we examine how the disturbance of the solar corona created by the propagation of flux ropes is transmitted into EUHFORIA. In particular, we consider the thermodynamic and magnetic profiles at L1 and compare them with those obtained at the interface between the two models.
  We demonstrate that the properties of the heliospheric solar wind in EUHFORIA are consistent with those in COCONUT, acting as a direct extension of the coronal domain. Moreover, the disturbances initially created from the propagation of flux ropes in COCONUT continue evolving from the corona in the heliosphere to Earth with a smooth transition at the interface between the two simulations. Looking at the profile of magnetic field components at Earth and different distances from the Sun, we also find that the transient magnetic structures have a self-similar expansion in COCONUT and EUHFORIA. However, the amplitude of the profiles depends on the flux rope model used and its properties, thus emphasizing the important role of the initial properties in solar source regions for accurately predicting the impact of CMEs.

arXiv:2411.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While experimental measurements of photon correlations have become routine in laboratories, theoretical access to these quantities for the light generated in complex nanophotonic devices remains a major challenge. Current methods are limited to specific simplified cases and lack generality. Here we present a novel method that provides access to photon statistics resolved in space and frequency in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. Within the macroscopic QED framework, we develop a practical tool to compute electric field correlations for complex quantum systems by including lossy two-level systems that act as field detectors within the system. To make the implementation feasible, we use a recently developed multi-emitter few-mode quantization method to correctly account for fully retarded light propagation to the detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique by studying the photon correlations of one and two emitters in close proximity to a plasmonic nanoparticle. The simulations show that even in these relatively simple configurations, the light statistics exhibit a strong angular dependence. These results highlight the importance of going beyond conventional quantum-optical approaches to fully capture the analyzed physical effects and enable the study of the quantum light generation in realistic nanophotonic devices.

Abstract: We present a new scale decomposition method to investigate turbulence in wavenumber-frequency space. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations, we show that magnetic fluctuations with time scales longer than the nonlinear time exhibit an inverse cascade toward even smaller frequencies. Low frequency magnetic fluctuations support turbulence, acting as an energy reservoir that is converted into plasma kinetic energy, the latter cascading toward large wavenumbers and frequencies, where it is dissipated. Our results shed new light on the spatio-temporal properties of turbulence, potentially explaining the origin and role of low frequency turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind.

arXiv:2311.00972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muography is a non-invasive imaging technique that exploits cosmic-ray muons to probe various targets by analyzing the absorption or scattering of muons. The method is particularly useful for applications ranging from geophysical exploration to security screening, including the identification of nuclear materials. This study leverages both Monte Carlo simulations and the Point of Closest Approach (PoCA) algorithm for image reconstruction to specifically explore the distortions caused by magnetic fields in scattering muography images. In the PoCA algorithm, it is assumed that all scattering of a muon during its travel in material occurs at a single point, known as the PoCA point. Each PoCA point is characterized by a scattering angle, whose distribution provides insights into the density and elemental composition of the target material. However, magnetic fields can influence muon trajectories according to Lorentz law, affecting the estimated positions of the PoCA points and the calculated scattering angles. This introduces challenges in applications such as border security control systems. Moreover, the presence of magnetic fields can lead to what we term "magnetic jamming", where the resulting muography image is distorted or misleading. This effect further complicates the accurate identification and interpretation of target materials. Our findings underline the necessity to account for magnetic field distortions when utilizing scattering muography in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Interactions between magnetic fields advected by matter play a fundamental role in the Universe at a diverse range of scales. A crucial role these interactions play is in making turbulent fields highly anisotropic, leading to observed ordered fields. These in turn, are important evolutionary factors for all the systems within and around. Despite scant evidence, due to the difficulty in measuring even near-Earth events, the magnetic field compression factor in these interactions, measured at very varied scales, is limited to a few. However, compressing matter in which a magnetic field is embedded, results in compression up to several thousands. Here we show, using laboratory experiments and matching three-dimensional hybrid simulations, that there is indeed a very effective saturation of the compression when two independent parallel-oriented magnetic fields regions encounter one another due to plasma advection. We found that the observed saturation is linked to a build-up of the magnetic pressure, which decelerates and redirects the inflows at their encounter point, thereby stopping further compression. Moreover, the growth of an electric field, induced by the incoming flows and the magnetic field, acts in redirecting the inflows transversely, further hampering field compression.

Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.

Abstract: The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider is preparing for an upgrade after 2027-2028 to handle higher luminosity and increased background rates. A Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) has been identified as a potential candidate for a common front-end upgrade for subsystems requiring high-speed waveform digitization. The RFSoC's ADC and DAC channels were tested across various magnetic field strengths and a few different field orientations. Power consumption and boot memory functionality were also assessed. Results indicate stable operation with negligible performance degradation, suggesting the RFSoC's viability for high-speed digitization tasks in high magnetic field environments.

Abstract: The Feibelman $d$-parameter, a mesoscopic complement to the local bulk permittivity, describes quantum optical surface responses for interfaces, including nonlocality, spill-in and-out, and surface-enabled Landau damping. It has been incorporated into the macroscopic Maxwellian framework for convenient modeling and understanding of nanoscale electromagnetic phenomena, calling for the compilation of a $d$-parameter database for interfaces of interest in nano-optics. However, accurate first-principles calculations of $d$-parameters face computational challenges, whereas existing measurements of $d$-parameters are scarce and restricted to narrow spectral windows. We demonstrate a general broadband ellipsometric approach to measure $d$-parameters at a gold--air interface across the visible--ultraviolet regimes. Gold is found to spill in and spill out at different frequencies. We also observe gold's Bennett mode, a surface-dipole resonance associated with a pole of the $d$-parameter, around 2.5 eV. Our measurements give rise to and are further validated by the passivity and Kramers--Kronig causality analysis of $d$-parameters. Our work advances the understanding of quantum surface response and may enable applications like enhanced electron field emission.

Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided radiation therapy (RT) is enhancing head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment through superior soft tissue contrast and longitudinal imaging capabilities. However, manual tumor segmentation remains a significant challenge, spurring interest in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation. To accelerate innovation in this field, we present the Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for MR-Guided Applications (HNTS-MRG) 2024 Challenge, a satellite event of the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention. This challenge addresses the scarcity of large, publicly available AI-ready adaptive RT datasets in HNC and explores the potential of incorporating multi-timepoint data to enhance RT auto-segmentation performance. Participants tackled two HNC segmentation tasks: automatic delineation of primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) and gross metastatic regional lymph nodes (GTVn) on pre-RT (Task 1) and mid-RT (Task 2) T2-weighted scans. The challenge provided 150 HNC cases for training and 50 for testing, hosted on Grand Challenge using a Docker submission framework. In total, 19 independent teams from across the world qualified by submitting both their algorithms and corresponding papers, resulting in 18 submissions for Task 1 and 15 submissions for Task 2. Evaluation using the mean aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient showed top-performing AI methods achieved scores of 0.825 in Task 1 and 0.733 in Task 2. These results surpassed clinician interobserver variability benchmarks, marking significant strides in automated tumor segmentation for MR-guided RT applications in HNC.

# Critical analysis of multiple reentrant localization in an antiferromagnetic helix with transverse electric field: Hopping dimerization-free scenario

arXiv:2312.02778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional substitutional disorder. We conduct a finite-size scaling analysis on the observed reentrant phases to identify critical points, determine associated critical exponents, and examine the scaling behavior linked to localization transitions. Additionally, we explore the parameter space to identify the conditions under which the reentrant phases occur. Described within a tight-binding framework, present work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry. Potential applications and experimental realizations of RL phenomena are also explored.

# Integrated ab initio modelling of atomic order and magnetic anisotropy for rare-earth-free magnet design: effects of alloying additions in $\mathrm{L}1_0$ FeNi

arXiv:2401.02809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an integrated modelling approach to accelerate the search for novel, single-phase, multicomponent materials with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA). For a given system we predict the nature of atomic ordering, its dependence on the magnetic state, and then proceed to describe the consequent MCA, magnetisation, and magnetic critical temperature (Curie temperature). Crucially, within our modelling framework, the same ab initio description of the material's electronic structure determines all aspects. We demonstrate this holistic method by studying the effects of alloying additions in FeNi, examining systems with the general stoichiometries Fe$_4$Ni$_3X$ and Fe$_3$Ni$_4X$, for additives including X= Pt, Pd, Al, and Co. The atomic ordering behaviour predicted on adding these elements, fundamental for determining a material's MCA, is rich and varied. Equiatomic FeNi has been reported to require ferromagnetic order to establish the tetragonal L10 order suited for significant MCA. Our results show that when alloying additions are included in this material, annealing in an applied magnetic field and/or below a material's Curie temperature may also promote tetragonal order, along with an appreciable effect on the predicted hard magnetic properties.

# Structure, short-range order, and phase stability of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy: Insights from a perturbative, DFT-based analysis

arXiv:2404.13173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase behaviour of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy. Our approach is based on a perturbative analysis of the internal energy of the paramagnetic solid solution as evaluated within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker formulation of density functional theory, using the coherent potential approximation to average over disorder. Via application of a Landau-type linear response theory, we infer preferential chemical orderings directly. In addition, we recover a pairwise form of the alloy internal energy suitable for study via atomistic simulations, which in this work are performed using the nested sampling algorithm, which is well-suited for studying complex potential energy surfaces. When the underlying lattice is fcc, at low concentrations of Al, depending on the value of $x$, we predict either an $\mathrm{L}1_2$ or $\mathrm{D}0_{22}$ ordering emerging below approximately 1000 K. On the other hand, when the underlying lattice is bcc, consistent with experimental observations, we predict $\mathrm{B}2$ ordering temperatures higher than the melting temperature of the alloy, confirming that this ordered phase forms directly from the melt. For both fcc and bcc systems, chemical orderings are dominated by Al moving to one sublattice, Ni and Co the other, while Cr and Fe remain comparatively disordered. On the bcc lattice, our atomistic modelling suggests eventual decomposition into $\mathrm{B}2$ NiAl and Cr-rich phases. These results shed light on the fundamental physical origins of atomic ordering tendencies in these intriguing materials.

# Spatially Separated yet Efficiently Connected: Polariton-Assisted Energy Transfer for Bilayer Organic Solar Cells

## 空间分离但有效连接: 双层有机太阳能电池的极化子辅助能量转移

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-dmd6l?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Organic solar cells (OSCs) hold significant promise as low-cost, flexible, and lightweight photovoltaic technologies. However, they encounter challenges such as instability in donor-acceptor (D-A) mixing and limited exciton dissociation in bilayer configurations. To address these issues, we propose a strategy that leverages polariton-mediated energy transfer by integrating a Fabry-Pérot cavity into bilayer OSCs. This configuration facilitates the formation of hybrid light-matter states, known as polaritons, which enable efficient energy transfer between spatially separated donor and acceptor layers. Our results indicate that the energy transfer rate ($k_t$) exhibits an $r^{-2}$ distance dependence, suggesting that the process is governed by near-field electromagnetic interactions rather than traditional Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). This distinct mechanism permits effective charge separation over extended distances, surpassing the limitations of conventional FRET. Consequently, we achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 10.1\%, a notable enhancement over standard bilayer devices. Our findings demonstrate that polariton-assisted energy transfer provides a  approach for improving OSC performance, offering a promising pathway to achieve both high efficiency and stability in organic photovoltaics.

# Selective Recovery of Gold from Electronic Circuit Board Waste with Pyrogallol-Formaldehyde Polymer

## 用邻苯三酚-甲醛聚合物从电子线路板废料中选择性回收金

Electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) has become one of the largest solid waste problems today, as it contains valuable recyclable materials like gold, platinum, and silver. Recycling of precious metals is important in terms of re-using the high precious metal content wastes. In this study, pyrogallol-formaldehyde polymer (PGNR) material was synthesized as an adsorbent. The obtained PGNR was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. The adsorption performance of solutions containing gold (III) ions was evaluated under variables such as different pH values, adsorbent amounts, initial concentrations, time and temperature. Data obtained from the experiments were used to perform adsorption isotherm, kinetic, and thermodynamic calculations. The results indicated that the "Pseudo Second Order Equation" provided the best fit for the kinetic data, while the "Langmuir Equation" was the most suitable for the isotherm data. The Langmuir isotherm revealed that the monolayer saturation capacity for Au(III) ions on the PGNR polymer was found to be 2456.78 mg/g at a temperature of 328 K. The FTIR analysis conducted after adsorption revealed that polyphenolic groups played a key role in the adsorption of Au(III) species. XRD and XPS characterization studies showed that nearly all of the Au(III) ions were reduced to metallic gold following adsorption. It was found that the PGNR polymer chosen as the adsorbent exhibited a high efficiency in adsorbing Au(III) from the actual leach solution derived from electronic waste. PGNR polymer particles are a potential adsorbent for the selective recovery of gold metal in leach solutions of electronic waste containing high concentrations of base metals.

# Optimising Coil Design Based on Sensitivity Analysis of Magnetic Force Induced Between Misaligned Coil Pairs

## 基于错位线圈对间感应磁力灵敏度分析的线圈优化设计

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5442468/latest

Cylindrical coils are widely used components in several modern technologies, and achieving the precise coaxial alignment condition for cylindrical coil positioning or installation is difficult due to inherent manufacturing errors. The lateral force induced by coil misalignment significantly impacts overall operational efficiency of systems, such as maglev systems applied in wind tunnels for drag measurement. Therefore, understanding the sensitivity of lateral force to misalignment in a coil-formed system is critical. In this study, multiple analytical methods are adopted to find the relationships between magnetic forces, coil misalignment, and coil geometry. A nondimensionalized misalignment parameter is introduced and used to investigate the sensitivity of magnetic force in both vertical and lateral directions to the variation of coil misalignment. In addition, coils with different geometry configurations were modelled and analysed under identical power input, showing the influence of geometric variations on the magnetic force sensitivity. Based on the findings of the sensitivity analysis, distinct strategies for coil design and selection are proposed respectively for static maglev systems and systems involving translational motion of objects.

In this manuscript, we explore the properties of a non-Hermitian spin-1/2 XY model subjected to alternating imaginary and transverse magnetic fields. Focusing on a two-spin system, we systematically construct the ground state phase diagram and provide an exact calculation of the ground state entanglement via the Negativity measure. Our findings reveal that, within eigenstates influenced by the anisotropy parameter, real magnetic fields, and imaginary magnetic fields, the anisotropy parameter significantly enhances entanglement, whereas the real magnetic field tends to diminish or even annihilate it. Notably, in the &Rho;&Tau;-symmetry broken phase, quantum entanglement demonstrates increased resilience to variations in the real magnetic field with the strengthening of the imaginary magnetic field. For eigenstates governed purely by the imaginary magnetic field, we observe that the two-spin entanglement remains maximal (i.e., value of 1) within the &Rho;&Tau;-symmetry region, while it gradually declines in the &Rho;&Tau;-symmetry broken region as the parameter &eta;0 decreases. An intriguing observation is that the first derivative of the Negativity shows non-analytic behavior at the critical points, highlighting the role of Negativity as a reliable and effective indicator of phase transitions in this non-Hermitian system.

# Application of magnetic resonance imaging parameters of knee joints in the diagnosis of lateral patellar compression syndrome

## 膝关节磁共振成像参数在髌骨外侧压迫综合征诊断中的应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5343796/latest

Background Lateral patellofemoral compression syndrome (LPCS) is a condition characterized by increased lateral patellofemoral joint pressure caused by long-standing lateral patella tilt, adaptive lateral retinaculum tightening, and an imbalance in stress between the lateral and medial femoral condyles. Diagnosis of LPCS is challenging because of its complex and diverse etiology and pain mechanisms, thus we lack objective diagnostic criteria.Purpose This study aimed to explore the feasibility of various structural measurement parameters of MRI of the knee to diagnose LPCS and to identify new MRI diagnostic indicators to as references and guidance for LPCS clinical diagnosis.Methods This study enrolled 168 patients, who were divided into three groups: The LPCS group, the simple osteoarthritis (SO) group, and the normal control group (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;56 participants per group). Diagnosis of all patients was carried out at the Department of Sports Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital. A standardized MR scanning protocol was used, including sagittal and coronal fat-suppressed proton density-weighted imaging and sagittal T1-weighted imaging. Two radiologists used the picture archiving and communication system to analyze the MR images and measure the patellarpatellar tibial angle (P-PTA), the quadriceps-patellar angle (Q-PA), the patellar length (LP), the patellar tendon length (LT), the LP/LT ratio, and the Insall-Salvati ratio (ISR).Results The LPCS group had significantly lower P-PTA and LP values, but higher LT and ISR values, compared with those in the normal and SO groups (all P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.05). Compared with that in the normal group, the LPCS groups' Q-PA value was higher (P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.034). According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, the optimal cut-off values for PPTA, LP, LP/LT, and ISR were 146.45&amp;deg;, 41.10mm, 0.85, and 1.19, with sensitivities and specificities of 67.86%/59.82%, 78.57%/55.36%, 67.86%/58.93%, and 66.07%/60.71%, respectively.Conclusion Measurement parameters of MRI, particularly P-PTA and ISR, can serve as important tools to assist in the diagnosis of LPCS. Assessment of these parameters should be included in the clinical diagnostic process for LPCS to improve diagnostic accuracy.
