# Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films

arXiv:2412.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths leading to higher TMR effects and better MTJ devices.

# Damping Enhancement in YIG at Millikelvin Temperatures due to GGG Substrate

## 由于GGG衬底，在毫开尔文温度下YIG的阻尼增强

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02827

arXiv:2412.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics aims to exploit the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), which offers the longest magnon lifetimes, is a key material typically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates for structural compatibility. However, the increased magnetic damping in YIG/GGG systems below 50$\,$K poses a challenge for quantum applications. Here, we study the damping in a 97$\,$nm-thick YIG film on a 500$\,\mu$m-thick GGG substrate at temperatures down to 30$\,$mK using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We show that the dominant physical mechanism for the observed tenfold increase in FMR linewidth at millikelvin temperatures is the non-uniform bias magnetic field generated by the partially magnetized paramagnetic GGG substrate. Numerical simulations and analytical theory show that the GGG-driven linewidth enhancement can reach up to 6.7 times. In addition, at low temperatures and frequencies above 18$\,$GHz, the FMR linewidth deviates from the viscous Gilbert-damping model. These results allow the partial elimination of the damping mechanisms attributed to GGG, which is necessary for the advancement of solid-state quantum technologies.

# Robust Edge States from Band Topology in a Damped One-dimensional Magnonic Crystal

## 阻尼一维磁振子晶体中能带拓扑的鲁棒边缘状态

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02880

arXiv:2412.02880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence or absence of topologically-produced edge states of a crystal are robust to disorder; their stability in the presence of decay is less clear. For topologically nontrivial bosonic systems with finite particle lifetimes, such as photonic, phononic, or magnonic structures, a natural hypothesis suggests that if the linewidth from particle decay exceeds the gap between neighboring bands, then topological features such as Berry phases or edge states will lose their protection. Here we show that topological properties are significantly more robust than this, by assessing the properties of a one-dimensional magnonic crystal as the damping is increased. Even when the damping greatly exceeds the gap between neighboring bands the Zak phase of those bands is nearly unchanged, and the edge states remain clearly visible in micromagnetic simulations of microwave transmission. These results clarify the understanding of robust topological properties and bulk-boundary correspondence.

# Orbital anomalous Hall effect in the few-layer Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4

## 几层Weyl半金属TaIrTe4中的轨道异常霍尔效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02937

arXiv:2412.02937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of the linear anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the nonmagnetic Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. This is achieved by applying a direct current Idc and an alternating current Iac (Iac<<Idc) in TaIrTe4, where the former induces time-reversal symmetry breaking and the latter probes the triggered AHE. The anomalous Hall resistance VacH/Iac shows a linear dependence on Idc and changes sign with the polarity of Idc. In temperature-dependent measurements, VacH/Iac also experiences a sign reversal at 100 K, consistent with the temperature-dependent nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). Furthermore, in measurements involving only dc transport, the dc Hall voltage exhibits a quadratic relationship with Idc. When the Idc direction is reversed, the Hall resistance changes sign, demonstrating a colossal nonreciprocal Hall effect (NRHE). Our theoretical calculations suggest that the observed linear AHE, NLHE, and NRHE all dominantly originate from the current-induced orbital magnetization compared to the minor spin contribution. This work provides deep insights into the orbital magnetoelectric effect and nonlinear Hall response, promising precise electric control of out-of-plane polarized orbit flow.

# Nonlinear spin and orbital Edelstein effect in WTe2

## WTe2中的非线性自旋和轨道Edelstein效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02938

arXiv:2412.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials with spin-momentum locked spin textures, such as Rashba states and topological surface states, the current-induced shift of the Fermi contour in the k space leads to spin polarization, known as the Edelstein effect, which depends linearly on the applied current. However, its nonlinear counterpart has not yet been discovered. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear Edelstein effect in few-layer WTe2. Under a current bias, an out-of-plane magnetization is induced in WTe2, which is electrically probed using an Fe3GeTe2 electrode, a van der Waals ferromagnet with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Notably, with an applied ac at frequency {\omega}, an induced magnetization with second-harmonic response at frequency 2{\omega} is observed, and its magnitude demonstrates a quadratic dependence on the applied current, characteristic of the nonlinear Edelstein effect. This phenomenon is well explained by the current-induced orbital magnetization via the Berry connection polarizability tensors in WTe2. The orbital degree of freedom plays the primary role in the observed nonlinear Edelstein effect, that is, the nonlinear orbital Edelstein effect. This can, in turn, give rise to a nonlinear spin Edelstein effect through spin-orbit coupling.

# Nonlinear Valley and Spin Valves in Bilayer Graphene

arXiv:2412.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear transport plays a vital role in probing the quantum geometry of Bloch electrons, valley chirality, and carrier scattering mechanisms. The nonlinear Hall effect, characterized by a nonlinear scaling of Hall voltage with longitudinal current, has been explored to reveal the Berry curvature and quantum metric related physics. In this work, we extend the study of nonlinear transport to spin and valley degrees of freedom. Using bilayer graphene devices with Fe3GeTe2 contacts, we observe a second-order nonlinear spin current exhibiting spin valve-like behaviors. By tracking magnetic moment precession under an in-plane magnetic field, we identify a significantly enhanced critical magnetic field required for in-plane rotation, suggesting out-of-plane valley polarization induced by ferromagnetic proximity. These findings offer deep insights into the interplay of valley and spin in second-order nonlinear transport, opening avenues for promising device applications.

# Quantized Landau-level crossing checkerboard in large-angle twisted graphene

## 大角度扭曲石墨烯中的量化Landau-水平交叉棋盘

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03004

arXiv:2412.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When charge transport occurs under conditions like topological protection or ballistic motion, the conductance of low-dimensional systems often exhibits quantized values in units of $e^{2}/h$, where $e$ and $h$ are the elementary charge and Planck's constant. Such quantization has been pivotal in quantum metrology and computing. Here, we demonstrate a novel quantized quantity: the ratio of the displacement field to the magnetic field, $D/B$, in large-twist-angle bilayer graphene. In the high magnetic field limit, Landau level crossings between the top and bottom layers manifest equal-sized checkerboard patterns throughout the $D/B$-$\nu$ space. It stems from a peculiar electric-field-driven interlayer charge transfer at one elementary charge per flux quantum, leading to quantized intervals of critical displacement fields, (i.e., $\delta D$ = $\frac{e}{2\pi l_{B}^{2}}$, where $l_B$ is the magnetic length). Our findings suggest that interlayer charge transfer in the quantum Hall regime can yield intriguing physical phenomena, which has been overlooked in the past.

# Deteriorated Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Bilayer Cobaltites

## 扭曲的双层钴矿中的层间耦合恶化

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03007

arXiv:2412.03007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wealth of remarkable behaviors is observed at the interfaces between magnetic oxides due to the coexistence of Coulomb repulsion and interatomic exchange interactions. While previous research has focused on bonded oxide heterointerfaces, studies on magnetism in van der Waals interfaces remain rare. In this study, we stacked two freestanding cobaltites with precisely controlled twist angles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed clear and ordered moir\'e patterns, which exhibit an inverse relationship with the twist angle. We found that the Curie temperature in the twisted region is reduced by approximately 13 K compared to the single-layer region using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry. This phenomenon may be related to the weakening of the orbital hybridization between oxygen ions and transition metal ions in the unbonded interfaces. Our findings suggest a potential avenue for modulating magnetic interactions in correlated systems through twist, providing opportunities for the discovery of unknown quantum states.

# Bulk-like structural, magnetic and optical properties of (111)- and (001)-NiO thin films

arXiv:2412.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have grown (111)- and (001)-oriented NiO thin films on (0001)-Sapphire and (001)-MgO substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD), respectively. DC magnetic susceptibility measurements underline that the N\'eel temperatures of the samples are beyond room-temperature. This is further confirmed by the presence of two-magnon Raman scattering modes in these films in ambient conditions. Moreover, relative intensity of the two magnon-mode with respect to a neighboring phonon mode in the films, at least down to 30 nm thickness, is comparable to the same for bulk NiO. UV-vis spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry determined that the bandgap of the films is 3.6 eV which is well within the range for bulk NiO. Thus, these indicate that the thin films are bulk-like. Further, photoluminescence measurements on (111)-NiO films obtained two-radiative transitions at 385 and 405 nm. The linewidth of the latter broadens towards low temperatures, indicating a plausible exciton-magnon coupling. Overall, these PLD-grown oxide films hold significant technological importance due to their optical transparency and their capacity to host robust magnons at room temperature.

arXiv:2412.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality pervades multiple scientific domains-physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy-and profoundly influences their foundational principles. Recently, the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) phenomenon has captured significant attention in physical chemistry due to its potential applications and intriguing underlying physics. Despite its prominence, the microscopic mechanisms of CISS remain hotly debated, hindering practical applications and further theoretical advancements. Here we challenge the established view that attributes CISS-related phenomena to current-induced spin polarization and electron transport across interfaces. We propose that molecular vibrations in chiral molecules primarily drive spin polarization, thereby governing CISS. Employing an electrochemical cell paired with a precisely engineered magnetic multilayer, we demonstrate that the magnetic interactions akin to interlayer exchange coupling are crucial for CISS. Our theoretical study suggests that molecular vibrations facilitate chirality-dependent spin polarization, which plays a pivotal role in CISS-related phenomena such as magnetoresistance and enantiomer separation using ferromagnets. These findings necessitate a paradigm shift in the design and analysis of systems in various scientific fields, extending the role of spin dynamics from traditional areas such as solid-state physics to chemical reactions, molecular biology, and even drug discovery.

# Proposal for Superconducting Photodiode

## 超导光电二极管的建议

arXiv:2412.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a concept of a superconducting photodiode - a device that transforms the energy and `spin' of an external electromagnetic field into the rectified steady-state supercurrent and develop a microscopic theory describing its properties. For this, we consider a two-dimensional thin film cooled down below the temperature of superconducting transition with the injected dc supercurrent and exposed to an external electromagnetic field with a frequency smaller than the superconducting gap. As a result, we predict the emergence of a photoexcited quasiparticle current, and, as a consequence, oppositely oriented stationary flow of Cooper pairs. The strength and direction of this photoinduced supercurrent depend on (i) such material properties as the effective impurity scattering time and the nonequilibrium quasiparticles' energy relaxation time and (ii) such electromagnetic field properties as its frequency and polarization.

arXiv:2412.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate both analytically and numerically the buildup of antiferromagnetic (AF) correlation in the dynamically tuned Ising model with various geometries by using the Rydberg atomic system. It is shown that Magnus expansion up to second order for the local lattice geometries can describe quantitatively the creation of the AF correlation for different lattice arrays, e.g., $2 \times n$ lattice, cyclic lattice with star, and triangular lattice. We find that the magnitude of AF correlation for the same Manhattan distance is the algebraic sum of the correlations contributed by all shortest paths -- a typical superposition law. Such a law is independent of nonequivalent paths, lattice geometries, and quench style.

# Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene

arXiv:2412.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles in response to electromagnetic fields give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response characterized by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength "squeezing", and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, semiconducting materials are dominated by interband collective excitations, giving rise to exciton-polaritons with completely different properties, characterized by a superposition of the photon and exciton. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and follow a universal dispersion law for surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses that would enable their observation in cryo-SNOM experiments. Furthermore, we show that by electrically tuning the excitons' energy we can enable and control their hybridization with hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons supported by the surrounding hBN, which is fully described by an electromagnetic transmission line model. These predictions of plasmons-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable plasmonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of various exotic quantum states in the equilateral triangular-lattice phosphates Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ with $J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2 and Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$ with $S$ = 1, the magnetic properties of spin-5/2 antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$, their classical counterpart, are comprehensively investigated experimentally. DC magnetization and specific heat measurements on polycrystalline samples indicate two successive magnetic transitions at $T\rm_{N1}$ $\approx$ 1.13 K and $T\rm_{N2}$ $\approx$ 1.28 K, respectively. Zero-field neutron powder diffraction measurement at 67 mK reveals a Y-like spin configuration as its ground-state magnetic structure, with both the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis components of the Mn$^{2+}$ moments long-range ordered. The incommensurate magnetic propagation vector $k$ shows a dramatic change for the intermediate phase between $T\rm_{N1}$ and $T\rm_{N2}$, in which the spin state is speculated to change into a collinear structure with only the $c$-axis moments ordered, as stabilized by thermal fluctuations. The successive magnetic transitions observed in Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ are in line with the expectation for a triangle-lattice antiferromagnet with an easy-axis magnetic anisotropy.

# Evidence of spin reorientation transition below 150 K from magnetic force microscopy in a ferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ thin film

Abstract: We investigated the magnetic transitions in BiFeO$_3$ at low temperature (5-300 K) and observed nearly 90$^o$ rotation of magnetic domains (imaged by vertical magnetic force microscopy) across 150 K in an epitaxial thin film of thickness $\sim$36 nm. It offers a clear evidence of spin reorientation transition. It also corroborates the transition observed below $\sim$150 K in the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization versus temperature data. The field-driven 180$^o$ domain switching at room temperature, on the other hand, signifies presence of ferromagnetism. Since bulk antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ does not exhibit such a transition, this observation in ferromagnetic thin film of BiFeO$_3$ indicates a radical effect because of epitaxial strain. Density functional theory based first-principles calculations too reveal that combined in- and out-of-plane epitaxial strain induces magnetic transition from G- to C-type structure in BiFeO$_3$.

Abstract: Stability boundaries of the skyrmion lattice in non-centrosymmetric bulk ferromagnets with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in external magnetic field are discussed. We compare the classical energies of the spin configuration of the conical helix and skyrmion lattice within the framework of the stereographic projection approach. It is well known that at low temperatures the skyrmion lattice loses energetically to the conical helix in the entire range of fields, $0 < H < H_{c2}$, where $H_{c2}$ is the transition field to the polarized collinear phase, and $g\mu_B H_{c2} \ll T_c$. We show that taking into account the dipole interaction does not qualitatively change the situation. However, the possibility of fluctuations in the absolute value of the equilibrium local magnetization in the Ginzburg-Landau functional leads, with increasing temperature, $T$, to the skyrmion lattice becoming energetically more favorable than the conical helix in a certain range of fields. We show that it occurs already in the first order of small parameter, $\propto g\mu_B H_{c2}/|T-T_c|$, at the level of mean field theory.

arXiv:2412.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first-principles results on the electronic and magnetic properties of the cubic bulk $\beta$-phase of iron(III) oxide (Fe$_2$O$_3$). Given that all Fe-Fe magnetic couplings are expected to be antiferromagnetic within this high-symmetry crystal structure, the system may exhibit some signature of magnetic frustration, making it challenging to identify its magnetic ground state. We have analyzed the possible magnetic phases of the $\beta$-phase among which there are ferrimagnets, altermagnets and Kramers antiferromagnets. While the $\alpha$-phase is an altermagnet and the $\gamma$-phase is a ferrimagnet, we conclude that the magnetic ground state for the bulk $\beta$-phase of Fe$_2$O$_3$ is a Kramers antiferromagnet, moreover, we find that close in energy there is a bulk d-wave altermagnetic phase. We report the density of states and the evolution band gap as a function of the electronic correlations, for suitable values of the Coulomb repulsion the system is a charge-transfer insulator with an indirect band gap of 1.5 eV. As the opposite to the $\gamma$-phase, the magnetic configuration between first-neighbor of the same kind is always antiferromagnetic while the magnetic configuration between Fe$_a$ and Fe$_b$ is ferro or antiferro. In this magnetic arrangement, first-neighbor interactions cancel out in the mean-field estimation of the N\'eel temperature, leaving second-neighbor magnetic exchanges as the primary contributors, resulting in a N\'eel temperature lower than that of other phases. Our work paves the way toward the ab initio study of nanoparticles and alloys for the $\beta$-phase of Fe$_2$O$_3$.

Abstract: Ultrathin 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) exhibit a range of intriguing magnetic phenomena, including all-optical switching of magnetization (AOS), fast current-induced domain wall motion (CIDWM), and the potential to act as orbital-to-spin angular momentum converters. For spintronic applications involving these materials, the Curie temperature is a crucial factor in determining not only the threshold energy for AOS, but also the material's resistance to temperature rise during CIDWM. However, the relationship between the Curie temperature, the thicknesses of the individual layers, and the specifics of the growth process remains an open question. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the Curie temperature of one of the archetype synthetic ferrimagnets with PMA, the Pt/Co/Gd trilayer, grown by DC magnetron sputtering and characterized with MOKE and SQUID. We provide an interpretation of the experiments we designed to address these outstanding questions through modeling of the deposition process and the induced magnetization at the Co/Gd interface. Our findings demonstrate that the Curie temperature and, by extension, the conditions for PMA and magnetic compensation, of these ultrathin 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets are not only impacted by the interface quality, which can be influenced by the sputtering process, but also to a significant extent by finite-size effects in the 4f-material. This work offers new methods and understanding to predict and manipulate the critical temperature and magnetostatic properties of 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets for spintronic applications and magneto-photonic integration.

# A Lower-Dimensional Remnant of Flux Attachment

## 助焊剂附着的低维残余

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03346

arXiv:2412.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux attachment is a mechanism allowing electric charges to capture magnetic flux in two spatial dimensions. Fundamentally, this is a consequence of the Aharonov-Bohm effect or, in field-theoretic language, of a Chern-Simons term. This is also intimately related to a transmutation of the exchange statistics of the original charges. We show that a remnant of this mechanism is found after a dimensional reduction of a pure Chern-Simons theory and its subsequent coupling to matter.

Abstract: The interplay between ion beam modification techniques in the MeV range and the controlled generation of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in nitrogen-doped synthetic diamond crystals is explored. An experimental approach employing both light (H+) and heavy (Br+6) ions was followed to assess their respective impacts on the creation of NV- centers, using different ion energies or fluences to generate varying amounts of vacancies. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to characterize NV- and neutral NV0 centers. Initially, no NV centers were detected post-irradiation, despite the presence of substitutional nitrogen and vacancies. However, after annealing at 800C (and in some cases at 900C), most samples exhibited a high density of NV0 and especially NV- centers. This demonstrates that thermal treatment is essential for vacancy-nitrogen recombination and NV- formation, often through electron capture from nearby nitrogen atoms. Notably, we achieved high NV- densities without graphitization, which is essential for preserving the material's properties for quantum applications. This study underscores and quantifies the effectiveness of MeV-range ions in controlling vacancy distributions and highlights their potential for optimizing NV- center formation to enhance the sensitivity of diamond-based quantum magnetic sensors.

# Thermodynamic Theory of Linear Optical and Electro-Optic Properties of Ferroelectrics

## 铁电体的线性光学和电光性质的热力学理论

arXiv:2412.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials underlie key optical technologies in optical communications, integrated optics and quantum computing. Yet, there is a lack of a consistent thermodynamic framework to predict the optical properties of ferroelectrics and the mutual connections among ferroelectric polarization, optical properties, and optical dispersion. For example, there is no existing thermodynamic model for establishing the relationship between the ferroelectric polarization and the optical properties in the visible spectrum. Here we present a thermodynamic theory of the linear optical and electro-optic properties of ferroelectrics by separating the lattice and electronic contributions to the total polarization. We introduce a biquadratic coupling between the lattice and electronic contributions validated by both first-principles calculations and experimental measurements. As an example, we derive the temperature and wavelength-dependent anisotropic optical properties of BaTiO3, including the full linear optical dielectric tensor and the linear electro-optic (Pockels) effect through multiple ferroelectric phase transitions, which are in excellent agreement with existing experimental data and first principles calculations. This general framework incorporates essentially all optical properties of materials, including coupling between the ionic and electronic order parameters, as well as their dispersion and temperature dependence, and thus offers a powerful theoretical tool for analyzing light-matter interactions in ferroelectrics-based optical devices.

# Gapped commensurate antiferromagnetic response in a strongly underdoped model cuprate superconductor

arXiv:2412.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a distinct possibility that spin fluctuations are the pairing interactions in a wide range of unconventional superconductors. In the case of the high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) cuprates, in which superconductivity emerges upon doping an antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating state, spin correlations might furthermore drive unusual pseudogap phenomena. Here we use polarized and unpolarized magnetic neutron scattering to study the simple tetragonal cuprate $\mathrm{HgBa}_{2}\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$ at very low doping ($T_c \approx 55$ K, hole concentration $p \approx 0.064$). In stark contrast to prior results for other underdoped cuprates, we find no evidence of incommensurate spin-density-wave, charge-spin stripe, or $q = 0$ magnetic order. Instead, the antiferromagnetic response in both the superconducting and pseudogap states is gapped below $\Delta_\mathrm{AF} \approx 6$ meV, commensurate over a wide energy range, and disperses above about 55 meV. Given the documented model nature of $\mathrm{HgBa}_{2}\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$, which exhibits high structural symmetry and minimal point disorder effects, we conclude that the observed behavior signifies the unmasked response of the quintessential $\mathrm{CuO}_{2}$ planes near the Mott-insulating state. These results for $\mathrm{HgBa}_{2}\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$ can therefore be expected to serve as a benchmark for a refined theoretical understanding of the cuprates.

# Absence of altermagnetic magnon band splitting in MnF$_2$

## MnF $_2 $ 中不存在磁magnon带分裂

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03545

arXiv:2412.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are collinear compensated magnets in which the magnetic sublattices are related by rotation rather than translation or inversion. One of the quintessential properties of altermagnets is the presence of split chiral magnon modes. Recently, such modes have been predicted in MnF$_2$. Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering results on an MnF$_2$ single-crystal along high-symmetry Brillouin zone paths for which the magnon splitting is expected. Within the resolution of our measurement, we do not observe the predicted splitting. The inelastic spectrum is well-modeled using $J_1, ~J_2, ~J_3$ nearest-neighbor exchange interactions with weak uniaxial anisotropy. These interactions have higher symmetry than the crystal lattice, while the interactions predicted to produce the altermagnetic splitting are negligibly small. Therefore, the two magnon modes appear to be degenerate over the entire Brillouin zone and the spin dynamics of MnF$_2$ is indistinguishable from a classical N\'eel antiferromagnet. Application of magnetic field causes a Zeeman splitting of the magnon modes close to the $\mathrm{\Gamma}$ point. Even if chiral magnon modes are allowed by altermagnetic symmetry, the splitting in real materials such as MnF$_2$ can be negligibly small.

Abstract: We consider the estimation of an unknown parameter $\theta$ via a many-body probe. The probe is initially prepared in a product state and many-body interactions enhance its $\theta$-sensitivity during the dynamics and/or in the steady state. We present bounds on the Quantum Fisher Information, and corresponding optimal interacting Hamiltonians, for two paradigmatic scenarios for encoding $\theta$: (i) via unitary Hamiltonian dynamics (dynamical metrology), and (ii) in the Gibbs and diagonal ensembles (time-averaged dephased state), two ubiquitous steady states of many-body open dynamics. We then move to the specific problem of estimating the strength of a magnetic field via interacting spins and derive two-body interacting Hamiltonians that can approach the fundamental precision bounds. In this case, we additionally analyze the transient regime leading to the steady states and characterize tradeoffs between equilibration times and measurement precision. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive picture of the potential of many-body control in quantum sensing.

arXiv:2412.03447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the bulk transport coefficients of uniaxial polycrystalline materials, including electrical and thermal conductivity, diffusivity, complex permittivity, and magnetic permeability, have Stieltjes integral representations involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators. The integral representations follow from resolvent representations of physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated with conductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and resistivity $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrix analysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory. We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random matrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete resolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involving the matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for the components of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^*$, involving spectral measures for the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms of their real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projection method that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that the spectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to a more efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulk transport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm by numerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and 3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.

Abstract: The simultaneous occurrence of electric-field controlled superconductivity and spin-orbit interaction makes two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) constructed from perovskite transition metal oxides promising candidates for the next generation of spintronics and quantum computing. It is, however, essential to understand the electronic bands thoroughly and verify the predicted electronic states experimentally in these 2DES to advance technological applications. Here, we present novel insights into the electronic states of the 2DES at oxide interfaces through comprehensive investigations of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in two different systems: EuO/KTaO$_3$ (EuO/KTO) and LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO). To accurately resolve these oscillations, we conducted transport measurements in high magnetic fields up to 60 T and low temperatures down to 100 mK. For 2D confined electrons at both interfaces, we observed a progressive increase of oscillations frequency and cyclotron mass with the magnetic field. We interpret these intriguing findings by considering the existence of non-trivial electronic bands, for which the $E-k$ dispersion incorporates both linear and parabolic dispersion relations. In addition to providing experimental evidence for topological-like electronic states in KTO-2DES and STO-2DES, the unconventional oscillations presented in this study establish a new paradigm for quantum oscillations in 2DES based on perovskite transition metal oxides, where the oscillations frequency exhibits quadratic dependence on the magnetic field.

Abstract: A detailed investigation of the structural and magnetic properties, including magnetocaloric effect, re-entrant spin-glass behavior at low temperature, and critical behavior in polycrystalline Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy is reported. The prepared alloy crystallizes in a cubic CsCl-type crystal structure with Pm-3m space group. The temperature-dependent magnetization data reveals a second-order paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition ($\sim$ 122.9 K), which is further supported by the analysis of the magnetocaloric effect. The isothermal magnetization loops show a soft ferromagnetic behavior of the studied alloy and also reveal an itinerant character of the underlying exchange interactions. In order to understand the nature of magnetic interactions, the critical exponents for spontaneous magnetization, initial magnetic susceptibility, and critical MH isotherm are determined using Modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fisher plots, and critical isotherm analysis. The derived critical exponents $\beta$ = 0.363(2), $\gamma$ = 1.384(3), and $\delta$ = 4.81(3) confirm the critical behavior similar to that of a 3D-Heisenberg-type ferromagnet with short-range exchange interactions that are found to decay with distance as J(r) $\approx$ r$^{-4.936}$. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the AC susceptibility data suggests that the frequency-dependent shifting of the peak temperatures is well explained using standard dynamic scaling laws such as the critical slowing down model and Vogel-Fulcher law, and confirms the signature of re-entrant spin-glass features in Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy. Furthermore, maximum magnetic entropy change of $\sim$ 1.92 J/kg-K and relative cooling power of $\sim$ 496 J/kg at 50 kOe applied magnetic field are determined from magnetocaloric studies that are comparable to those of other Mn-Fe-Al systems.

Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering technique is employed to investigate the paramagnetic spin dynamics in a single crystalline sample of the magnetocaloric compound MnFe$_4$Si$_3$. In the investigated temperature range, 1.033$\times T_{C}$ to 1.5$\times T_{C}$, where $T_C$ is the Curie temperature, the spin fluctuations are well described by the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model predictions. Apart from the Heisenberg exchange, additional pseudo-dipolar interactions manifest through a finite long-wavelength relaxation rate that vanishes at the transition temperature ($T_C = 305$\,K). Based on the characteristic extend of spin fluctuations in wave-vector and energy space we determine that the nature of magnetism in MnFe$_4$Si$_3$ is localized above room temperature. This contrasts with the most celebrated Mn and Fe based magnetocaloric materials that are considered as itinerant magnets.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to modelling economic agents as analogous to spin states in physics, particularly the Ising model. By associating economic activity with spin orientations (up for inactivity, down for activity), the study delves into optimizing market dynamics using concepts from statistical mechanics. Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, the aim is to maximize surplus by allowing the market to evolve freely toward equilibrium. The introduction of temperature represents the frequency of economic activities, which is crucial for optimizing consumer and producer surplus. The government's role as a temperature regulator (raising temperature to stimulate economic activity) is explored. Results from simulations and policy interventions, such as introducing a "magnetic field," are discussed, showcasing complexities in optimizing economic systems while avoiding undue control that may destabilize markets. The study provides insights into bridging concepts from physics and economics, paving the way for a deeper understanding of economic dynamics and policy interventions.

Abstract: In some intermetallic compounds, the crystallographic structure allows for an unusual latitude of movement of lanthanide ions inside so-called cages. Examples of such magnetic cage systems include the rare-earth hexaborides RB6 and filled skutterudites RPt4Ge12 series. In both instances, the rare-earth site, at the center of the cage, is of high symmetry, which may preserve some degree of orbital degeneracy. A deviation from the cage center lifts this degeneracy, yielding an interplay between the rare-earth movement and the system properties in the paramagnetic range. In particular, the low temperature thermal expansion should reflect this cage-specific crystal field contribution. This study presents an experimental investigation of the thermal expansion in the paramagnetic range of some elements in the aforementioned series. From a simple model for the vibrations in cage systems, a description of the phononic thermal expansion is proposed, within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Accounting for this non-magnetic contributions helps discern the influence of the orbital degeneracy at low temperature.

# A nanolaser with extreme dielectric confinement

arXiv:2412.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between light and matter can be enhanced by spatially concentrating the light field to boost the photon energy density and increasing the photon dwell time to prolong energy transfer between light and matter. Traditionally, strong spatial light localization has been achieved using plasmonics, which, despite its effectiveness, entails ohmic losses. Recent advances in nanostructured dielectrics offer an avenue for achieving strong light confinement without metallic losses. However, previous studies primarily focused on minimizing the optical mode volume without adequately addressing light-matter interactions. Here, we develop a nanolaser that simultaneously localizes the electromagnetic field and excited carriers within the same region of a dielectric nanobridge. This extreme dielectric confinement of both light and matter achieves a mode volume below the diffraction limit and a subwavelength carrier volume without the introduction of lateral quantum confinement, enabling continuous-wave lasing at room-temperature. Moreover, we observe a strong correlation between the mode field and carrier distribution, and unexpectedly, the enhanced mode field localization automatically leads to more pronounced carrier localization, promoting self-alignment of light and matter, which significantly reduces the laser threshold. We quantify the intensified light-matter interaction with a newly proposed interaction volume, which generalizes the concept of mode volume to a broad class of active media. Our work lays the ground for developing ultra-efficient optoelectronic devices by greatly enhancing light-matter interactions through advanced material nanostructuring.

Abstract: Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly coupled molecule-cavity systems remains a significant challenge in molecular polaritonics. This work develops a comprehensive self-consistent model simulating electromagnetic interactions of diatomic molecules with quantum ro-vibrational degrees of freedom in resonant optical cavities. The approach employs an efficient numerical methodology to solve coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell equations in real space-time, enabling three-dimensional simulations through a novel molecular mapping technique. The study investigates relaxation dynamics of an ensemble of molecules following intense resonant pump excitation in Fabry-Perot cavities and at three-dimensional plasmonic metasurfaces. The simulations reveal dramatically modified relaxation pathways inside cavities compared to free space, characterized by persistent molecular alignment arising from cavity-induced rotational pumping. They also indicate the presence of a previously unreported relaxation stabilization mechanism driven by dephasing of the collective molecular-cavity mode. Additionally, the study demonstrates that strong molecular coupling significantly modifies the circular dichroism spectra of chiral metasurfaces, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in quantum optical systems.

Abstract: A comprehensive approach for simulating lasing dynamics in a liquid crystal based laser is presented. The approach takes into account the transformation of the liquid crystal structure caused by applied voltage. In particular, it allows us to explicitly account for a resonant mode frequency shift in the laser equations. The laser dynamic is described by a set of coupled non-linear differential equations for dye polarizations, population densities and the electromagnetic fields. The proposed model is applied to a photonic crystal$-$metal microcavity filled with a resonant nematic liquid crystal layer doped with a dye. The calculated lasing spectra governed by external electric field are verified in comparison with measured spectra.

Abstract: Energetic charged particles generated by inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions encode information about the spatial morphology of the hot-spot and dense fuel during the time of peak fusion reactions. The knock-on deuteron imager (KoDI) was developed at the Omega Laser Facility to image these particles in order to diagnose low-mode asymmetries in the hot-spot and dense fuel layer of cryogenic deuterium--tritium ICF implosions. However, the images collected are distorted in several ways that prevent reconstruction of the deuteron source. In this paper we describe these distortions and a series of attempts to mitigate or compensate for them. We present several potential mechanisms for the distortions, including a new model for scattering of charged particles in filamentary electric or magnetic fields surrounding the implosion. A novel particle-tracing methodology is developed and utilized to create synthetic KoDI data based on the filamentary field model that reproduces the main experimentally observed image distortions. We conclude with a discussion of the outlook for KoDI, and potential considerations for other charged-particle diagnostics.

arXiv:2412.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacecraft observations of high-energy electron flux enhancement up to 125 keV at Earth's magnetopause are typically linked to the magnetic reconnection. Here, we report the first ever observation of prolonged electron flux enhancement reaching very high energy up to 650 keV at magnetopause near the subsolar point, notably without reconnection signatures. The observation reveals that the high-energy electron flux enhancement near the magnetopause is associated with the simultaneous occurrence of electron cyclotron wave harmonics, whistler waves, and Langmuir waves. Theoretical modeling confirms the wave generation by electron temperature anisotropy and the electron loss cone distribution. This direct, in-situ observation of high-energy electron flux linked to cascaded wave-particle interactions will help us advance our understanding about the tiniest electron-scale intricacies affecting near-Earth space weather.

Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths leading to higher TMR effects and better MTJ devices.

Abstract: Works on the energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection attract more attentions in recent years. Discussions on this topic, however, are often based on many simplifications, such as assuming a circularly flowing bulk plasma and a fixed orientation angle. A significant gap remains between theoretical models and the magnetic reconnection occurring in real astrophysical scenarios. In our previous work, we investigated the influence of orientation angle on energy extraction and figured out the differences between the plunging and circularly flowing bulk plasma. We introduced the concept of covering factor to quantify the capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole. In this work, as an improvement, we extend our discussions by treating the parameters in reconnection models as free parameters, bringing the theoretical model closer to the situations in real astrophysical systems. We employ two reconnection models, in which the geometric index and the guide field fraction are respectively induced. We separately present the dependences of energy extraction on the geometric index and the guide field fraction. More importantly, we propose to define the averaged covering factor weighted by reconnection rate to quantify the overall capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole, under the assumption that the magnetic reconnection process occurs stochastically and randomly within the ergosphere.

Abstract: We propose a concept of a superconducting photodiode - a device that transforms the energy and `spin' of an external electromagnetic field into the rectified steady-state supercurrent and develop a microscopic theory describing its properties. For this, we consider a two-dimensional thin film cooled down below the temperature of superconducting transition with the injected dc supercurrent and exposed to an external electromagnetic field with a frequency smaller than the superconducting gap. As a result, we predict the emergence of a photoexcited quasiparticle current, and, as a consequence, oppositely oriented stationary flow of Cooper pairs. The strength and direction of this photoinduced supercurrent depend on (i) such material properties as the effective impurity scattering time and the nonequilibrium quasiparticles' energy relaxation time and (ii) such electromagnetic field properties as its frequency and polarization.

Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles in response to electromagnetic fields give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response characterized by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength "squeezing", and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, semiconducting materials are dominated by interband collective excitations, giving rise to exciton-polaritons with completely different properties, characterized by a superposition of the photon and exciton. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and follow a universal dispersion law for surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses that would enable their observation in cryo-SNOM experiments. Furthermore, we show that by electrically tuning the excitons' energy we can enable and control their hybridization with hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons supported by the surrounding hBN, which is fully described by an electromagnetic transmission line model. These predictions of plasmons-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable plasmonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.

Abstract: Segmenting stroke lesions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is challenging due to diverse clinical imaging domains, with existing models struggling to generalise across different MRI acquisition parameters and sequences. In this work, we propose two novel physics-constrained approaches using synthetic quantitative MRI (qMRI) images to enhance the robustness and generalisability of segmentation models. We trained a qMRI estimation model to predict qMRI maps from MPRAGE images, which were used to simulate diverse MRI sequences for segmentation training. A second approach built upon prior work in synthetic data for stroke lesion segmentation, generating qMRI maps from a dataset of tissue labels. The proposed approaches improved over the baseline nnUNet on a variety of out-of-distribution datasets, with the second approach outperforming the prior synthetic data method.

Abstract: The interplay between ion beam modification techniques in the MeV range and the controlled generation of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in nitrogen-doped synthetic diamond crystals is explored. An experimental approach employing both light (H+) and heavy (Br+6) ions was followed to assess their respective impacts on the creation of NV- centers, using different ion energies or fluences to generate varying amounts of vacancies. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to characterize NV- and neutral NV0 centers. Initially, no NV centers were detected post-irradiation, despite the presence of substitutional nitrogen and vacancies. However, after annealing at 800C (and in some cases at 900C), most samples exhibited a high density of NV0 and especially NV- centers. This demonstrates that thermal treatment is essential for vacancy-nitrogen recombination and NV- formation, often through electron capture from nearby nitrogen atoms. Notably, we achieved high NV- densities without graphitization, which is essential for preserving the material's properties for quantum applications. This study underscores and quantifies the effectiveness of MeV-range ions in controlling vacancy distributions and highlights their potential for optimizing NV- center formation to enhance the sensitivity of diamond-based quantum magnetic sensors.

Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the bulk transport coefficients of uniaxial polycrystalline materials, including electrical and thermal conductivity, diffusivity, complex permittivity, and magnetic permeability, have Stieltjes integral representations involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators. The integral representations follow from resolvent representations of physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated with conductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and resistivity $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrix analysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory. We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random matrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete resolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involving the matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for the components of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^*$, involving spectral measures for the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms of their real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projection method that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that the spectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to a more efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulk transport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm by numerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and 3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.

# Energy Dissipation in Strong Collisionless Shocks: The Crucial Role of Ion-to-Electron Scale Separation in Particle-in-Cell Simulations

## 强无碰撞冲击中的能量耗散: 离子-电子尺度分离在粒子模拟中的关键作用

Abstract: Energy dissipation in collisionless shocks is a key mechanism in various astrophysical environments. Its non-linear nature complicates analytical understanding and necessitate Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. This study examines the impact of reducing the ion-to-electron mass ratio ($m_r$), to decrease computational cost, on energy partitioning in 1D3V (one spatial and three velocity-space dimensions) PIC simulations of strong, non-relativistic, parallel electron-ion collisionless shocks using the SHARP code. We compare simulations with a reduced mass ratio ($m_r = 100$) to those with a realistic mass ratio ($m_r = 1836$) for shocks with high ($\mathcal{M}_A = 21.3$) and low ($\mathcal{M}_A = 5.3$) Alfv$\acute{\text{e}}$n Mach numbers. Our findings show that the mass ratio significantly affects particle acceleration and thermal energy dissipation. At high $\mathcal{M}_A$, a reduced mass ratio leads to more efficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at higher momentum. At low $\mathcal{M}_A$, it causes complete suppression of electron acceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electron acceleration. The reduced mass ratio also results in excessive electron heating and lower heating in downstream ions at both Mach numbers, with slightly more magnetic field amplification at low $\mathcal{M}_A$. Consequently, the electron-to-ion temperature ratio is high at low $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to reduced ion heating and remains high at high $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to increased electron heating. In contrast, simulations with the realistic $m_r$ show that the ion-to-electron temperature ratio is independent of the upstream magnetic field, a result not observed in reduced $m_r$ simulations.

# Satellite monitoring of long period ocean-induced magnetic field variations

Abstract: Satellite magnetic field observations have the potential to provide valuable information on dynamics, heat content and salinity throughout the ocean. Here we present the expected spatio-temporal characteristics of the ocean-induced magnetic field at satellite altitude on periods of months to decades. We compare these to the characteristics of other sources of Earth's magnetic field, and discuss whether it is feasible for the ocean-induced magnetic field to be retrieved and routinely monitored from space. We focus on large length scales (spherical harmonic degrees up to 30) and periods from one month up to five years. To characterize the expected ocean signal we make use of advanced numerical simulations taking high resolution oceanographic inputs and solve the magnetic induction equation in 3D including galvanic coupling and self induction effects. We find the time-varying ocean-induced signal dominates over the primary source of the internal field, the core dynamo, at high spherical harmonic degree with the cross-over taking place at degree 15 to 20 depending on the considered period. The ionospheric and magnetospheric fields (including their Earth induced counterparts) have most power on periods shorter than one month and are expected to be mostly zonal in magnetic coordinates at satellite altitude. Based on these findings we discuss future prospects for isolating and monitoring long period ocean induced magnetic field variations using data collected by present and upcoming magnetic survey satellites.

# Coherence effects in LIPSS formation on silicon wafers upon picosecond laser pulse irradiations

## 皮秒激光脉冲辐照对硅片上LIPSS形成的相干效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11700

arXiv:2411.11700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using different laser irradiation patterns to modify of silicon surface, it has been demonstrated that, at rather small overlapping between irradiation spots, highly regular laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) can be produced already starting from the second laser pulse, provided that polarization direction coincides with the scanning direction. If the laser irradiation spot is shifted from the previous one perpendicular to light polarization, LIPSS are not formed even after many pulses. This coherence effect is explained by a three-wave interference, - surface electromagnetic waves (SEWs) generated within the irradiated spot, SEWs scattered from the crater edge formed by the previous laser pulse, and the incoming laser pulse, - providing conditions for amplification of the periodic light-absorption pattern. To study possible consequences of SEW scattering from the laser-modified regions, where the refractive index can change due to material melting, amorphization, and the residual stress formed by previous laser pulses, hydrodynamic modelling and simulations have been performed within the melting regime. The simulations show that stress and vertical displacement could be amplified upon laser scanning. Both mechanisms, three-wave interference and stress accumulation, could enable an additional degree of controlling surface structuring.

# Symmetry based efficient simulation of dissipative quantum many-body dynamics in subwavelength quantum emitter arrays

## 基于对称性的亚波长量子发射器阵列中耗散量子多体动力学的高效模拟

arXiv:2409.02790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method to numerically simulate the dissipative dynamics of large numbers of quantum emitters in ordered arrays in the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the vacuum electromagnetic field. Using the spatial symmetries of the system, we rewrite the equations of motion in a collective spin basis and subsequently apply a higher-order cumulant expansion for the collective operators. By truncating the subradiant collective modes with a heavily suppressed decay rate and keeping only the effect from the radiating collective modes, we reduce the numerical complexity significantly. This allows to efficiently compute the dissipative dynamics of the observables of interest for a linear, ring-shaped and planar arrays of quantum emitters. In particular, we characterize the excited population, the total photon emission rate and the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau =0)$, which are challenging to compute for large systems with traditional cumulant expansion methods based on the individual spins.

# Identification of an Allene Warhead that Selectively Targets a Histidine Residue in the Escherichia coli Oxidoreductase Enzyme DsbA

## 鉴定选择性靶向大肠杆菌氧化还原酶DsbA中组氨酸残基的Allene弹头

Covalent modification of protein targets has application in both protein activity profiling and in drug discovery. Covalent warheads typically contain an electrophile that selectively reacts with nucleophilic residues in a protein target, such as cysteine, serine and threonine. Expanding this to other amino acids is an emerging strategy in covalent probe design. Allenes, while known in synthetic chemistry, have not been widely reported for their use as covalent warheads. This study reports the discovery and characterisation of the covalent reaction between a novel allene warhead and a histidine residue in the active site of the bacterial thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase enzyme Escherichia coli DsbA (EcDsbA). The covalent interaction was characterised by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. This analysis provided insights into the structure, reaction rate and selectivity of the allene. Investigation of the reactivity with nucleophilic amino acids revealed that the reaction with the allene warhead shows some specificity for the histidine in the active site of EcDsbA. This discovery expands the tools of chemical biology by identifying a novel warhead that covalently modifies a histidine residue. This may offer new avenues for targeted protein modification.

# Probing the Structure and Dynamics of the [NH4]M(HCO2)3 Ferroelectric Phases: Dielectric Relaxation through Orientational Disorder

## 探测 [NH4]M(HCO2)3铁电相的结构和动力学: 通过取向无序的介电弛豫

We report detailed structural studies of the low-temperature ferroelectric phases of [NH4]M(HCO2)3, where M = Mn2+ and Zn2+, finding that a third of the NH4+ cations remain subtly rotationally disordered to low temperature in both compounds. All NH4+ cations within the channels are well separated from each other, with significant hydrogen bonds only with the anionic M(HCO2)3 framework. Complementary studies of the dynamics using 2H solid state NMR and quasielastic neutron scattering indicate significant motion in both paraelectric and ferroelectric phases, which evolves gradually with increasing temperature with no abrupt change at the phase transition. Nudged elastic band calculations suggest that the activation barrier for flipping between “up” and “down” orientations of the NH4+ cations is low in the ferroelectric phase, with the NH4+ cations primarily interacting with the framework rather than the neighbouring molecular cations. It is likely this motion that is responsible for scrambling the NH4+ cation orientation locally in the ferroelectric phase. We propose that this disorder, with the same basic motion active above and below the phase transition, induces the significant dielectric relaxation associated with these materials’ relaxor-like dielectric properties.

# Unveiling the Dance of Molecules: Ro-Vibrational Dynamics of Molecules under Intense Illumination at Complex Plasmonic Interfaces

Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly coupled molecule-cavity systems remains a significant challenge in molecular polaritonics. This work develops a comprehensive self-consistent model simulating electromagnetic interactions of diatomic molecules with quantum ro-vibrational degrees of freedom in resonant optical cavities. The approach employs an efficient numerical methodology to solve coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell equations in real space-time, enabling three-dimensional simulations through a novel molecular mapping technique. The study investigates relaxation dynamics of an ensemble of molecules following intense resonant pump excitation in Fabry-Perot cavities and at three-dimensional plasmonic metasurfaces. The simulations reveal dramatically modified relaxation pathways inside cavities compared to free space, characterized by persistent molecular alignment arising from cavity-induced rotational pumping. They also indicate the presence of a previously unreported relaxation stabilization mechanism driven by dephasing of the collective molecular-cavity mode. Additionally, the study demonstrates that strong molecular coupling significantly modifies the circular dichroism spectra of chiral metasurfaces, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in quantum optical systems.

# Synthesis and characterization of magnetically separable Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2-Ag composite for degradation of Acid Blue 161

## 磁性可分离Fe3O4 @ SiO2 @ TiO2-Ag复合材料的合成与表征，用于酸性蓝161的降解

Recyclable core-shell photocatalysts with high photocatalytic activity, which are used in water treatment and developed with great efforts in material chemistry, have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Fe3O4@SiO2 composite was synthesized by the St&amp;ouml;ber method, and Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2 and Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2-Ag composites were successfully synthesized by the sol-gel method. For the characterization of the composites, besides SEM-EDS, TEM, XRD, FTIR, UV-Vis, XPS, and VSM devices were used for magnetization measurement and then the photocatalytic activity on Acid Blue 161 dyestuff was tested. Acid Blue 161 dyestuff was used to examine the photocatalytic degradation of composites. The Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2 composite doped with Ag particles showed better photocatalytic activity than the commercially used Degussa P25 due to the suppression of the recombination of electron-hole pairs. Compared with other composites, the Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2-Ag composite exhibited high photocatalytic activity by removing 100% of the dye under UV radiation. The synthesized Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2-Ag composite photocatalyst is a cost-effective photocatalytic system due to its wide application area, high efficiency, and recyclability.

# The Role of Adipose-Derived Stem Cells in Knee Osteoarthritis Treatment: Insights from a Triple-Blind Clinical Study

## 脂肪干细胞在膝骨关节炎治疗中的作用: 来自一项三盲临床研究的见解

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5475299/latest

Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects older adults, characterized by cartilage degradation, synovitis, and osteophyte formation. Despite its prevalence, no medical treatment can reverse the joint cartilage degradation, leading many patients to undergo invasive procedures such as arthroplasty. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), particularly those derived from adipose tissue, have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach due to their ability to differentiate into chondrocytes and potentially regenerate cartilage. While MSCs from bone marrow and umbilical cord have shown efficacy in treating OA, adipose-derived MSCs are more accessible and cost-effective. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs in treating knee OA.
Methods: This triple-blind, interventional clinical trial included 20 patients with idiopathic knee OA, meeting the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an intra-articular injection of either 8.5&times;10^6 allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs or saline (control group). Participants were evaluated for clinical signs of inflammation at baseline, and then at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months post-injection using clinical assessments, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), range of motion (ROM), and Magnetic Resonance Arthrography (MRA).
Results: The MSC group exhibited significant improvement in pain reduction as measured by VAS scores compared to the control group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed between the groups in ROM, quality of life, or daily activities as assessed by KOOS. Radiological outcomes showed a significant increase in cartilage thickness at specific locations (e.g., MLP, TCL) in the MSC group after 6 months, demonstrating the regenerative potential of MSCs in certain MRA sites.
Conclusion: Allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs are safe and effective in reducing pain and increasing cartilage thickness in knee OA patients. However, they do not significantly enhance quality of life or daily activity compared to placebo. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is needed to confirm these findings and determine optimal dosing strategies.

The detection of aircraft skin is an indispensable part of the design and &amp;micro;anufacturing process. This paper proposes a non-destructive testing &amp;micro;ethod for aircraft co&amp;micro;posite skin defects based on electro&amp;micro;agnetic sensor. Firstly, Using the perturbation theory, an electro&amp;micro;agnetic nondestructive testing &amp;micro;odel of aircraft skin defects is established. Then, according to the plas&amp;micro;on theory, a nested co&amp;micro;ple&amp;micro;entary split resonant ring (CSRR) electro&amp;micro;agnetic sensor is designed. Si&amp;micro;ulation using HFSS, it shows that it can effectively detect air hole defects with dia&amp;micro;eters of 2&amp;micro;&amp;micro; and above and burial depths within 1&amp;micro;&amp;micro;, fiber break defects with lengths above 4&amp;micro;&amp;micro;, widths of 0.2&amp;micro;&amp;micro; and above, and burial depths within 1&amp;micro;&amp;micro;. Finally, a physical test was carried out, and a 10&amp;micro;&amp;micro; dia&amp;micro;eter air hole defect in the aircraft skin sa&amp;micro;ple could be detected.Index Terms&amp;mdash;Nondestructive Testing, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic, Metamaterial Sensor
