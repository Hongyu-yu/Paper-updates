# Binding mechanism of adenylate kinase-specific monobodies

## 腺苷酸激酶特异性单体的结合机制

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-7591m-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Shun-ichi, Tanaka

Monobody, an antibody-mimetic protein, regulates enzyme functions through protein-protein interactions. In this study, we investigated the binding mechanisms of monobodies to adenylate kinase (Adk). Calorimetric and X-ray crystallographic analyses revealed that CL-1, a monobody specific for the CLOSED form of Adk, binds to the CORE domain of Adk in an enthalpy-driven manner, forming several hydrogen bonds and a cation-π interaction at the protein interface, without perturbating the Adk backbone. In contrast, OP-4, an OPEN-form-specific monobody, exhibited the entropy-driven binding. 1H–15N 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 31P-NMR studies revealed conformational perturbations to Adk by OP-4, while substrate access remained intact. The different thermodynamic and structural effects between the monobodies highlight the diverse binding mechanisms among monobodies.

# Enabling nondestructive observation of electrolyte composition in batteries with ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance

## 通过超低场核磁共振对电池中的电解质成分进行无损观察

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-32xj9-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Mengjiang, Lin

Although reliable rechargeable batteries represent a key transformative technology for electric vehicles, portable electronics, and renewable energy, there are few nondestructive diagnostic techniques compatible with realistic commercial cell enclosures. Many battery failures result from the loss or chemical degradation of electrolyte. In this work, we present measurements through battery enclosures that allow quantification of electrolyte amount and composition. The study employs instrumentation and techniques developed in the context of zero-to-ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR), with optical atomic magnetometers as the detection elements. In contrast to conventional NMR methodology, which suffers from skin-depth limitations, the reduced resonance frequencies in ZULF NMR make battery housing and electrodes transparent to the electromagnetic fields involved. As demonstrated here through simulation and experiment, both the solvent and lithium-salt components of the electrolyte (LiPF6) signature could be quantified using our techniques. Further, we show that the apparatus is compatible with measurement of pouch-cell batteries.

# Pore Network Tortuosity Controls Fast-Charging in Supercapacitors

## 孔隙网络曲折度控制超级电容器的快速充电

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-rjgwd-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Alexander, Forse

Ionic transport within porous carbon electrodes is crucial for optimizing charge/discharge rates in supercapacitors, yet the material properties governing ion dynamics remain poorly understood. Contrary to the traditional viewpoint, we find that mesoporosity does not necessarily correlate with high supercapacitor rate capability. Instead, we employed pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance to directly measure anionic effective diffusivities in the carbon pores, offering a probe of ionic transport in supercapacitors. Our findings reveal a significant discrepancy between short-range and long-range diffusivities, which captures the tortuosity of the pore network. Short-range diffusivities lack correlation with supercapacitor rate capability, whereas long-range diffusivities correlate strongly. Ultimately, low-tortuosity nanoporous carbons exhibited superior rate capability, highlighting the importance of well-interconnected pore networks for efficient ion transport. Our study reveals pore network tortuosity as a key factor that governs charging rates in amorphous nanoporous carbons and guides the design of electrodes with optimized transport channels to enhance supercapacitor performance.

# Nanosecond-level time-domain coding metasurface for radar signal generation

## 用于雷达信号生成的纳秒级时域编码超表面

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5538449/latest

The time-domain coding metasurface (TDCM) offers a rapid and efficient approach to manipulate frequency spectra of electromagnetic waves within their transmission channels. To date, not only finite-order harmonics can be generated and coded in a discrete manner, the method of frequency modulation for continuous temporal waves is also investigated. However, due to the achievable speed of phase tuning, the modulation bandwidth and applicable scope of the current methods are still limited with respect to the requirement of practical systems. Here, we provide theoretical evaluations of the quality of generated frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar signals with respect to the phase tuning speed, as well as a time-coding metasurface that can achieve a phase tuning speed smaller than 20 ns to support the generation of high quality FMCW signals with a bandwidth larger than 10 MHz. Different from varactors used in conventional approaches, the phase tuning of the proposed TDCM is based on the reconfiguration of a PIN-diode array. With this measure, the phase transition time between adjacent phase states can be reduced to a nano-second level, which is crucial for ultrahigh-speed coding. Furthermore, this design approach is also convenient to be rolled out to X- and even higher frequency bands, which overcomes the frequency spectra constraint when varactors are used. To validate its effectiveness, we have built a C-band radar prototype in which the metasurface operates as a transmitter to measure the range and speed of a flying drone.
