# Strong Coupling Theory of Superconductivity and Ferroelectric Quantum Criticality in metallic SrTiO$_3$

## 金属SrTiO $_3 $ 中超导电性和铁电量子临界的强耦合理论

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05374

arXiv:2412.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ has remained an enduring mystery for over 50 years. The material's status as a ``quantum" ferroelectric metal, characterized by a soft polar mode, suggests that quantum criticality could play a pivotal role in the emergence of its superconducting state. We show that the system is amenable to a strong coupling (Eliashberg) pairing analysis, with the dominant coupling to the soft mode being a ``dynamical'' Rashba coupling. We compute the expected $T_c$ for the entire phase diagram, all the way to the quantum critical point and beyond. We demonstrate that the linear coupling is sufficient to obtain a rough approximation of the experimentally measured phase diagram, but that nonlinear coupling terms are crucial in reproducing the finer features in the ordered phase. The primary role of nonlinear terms at the peak of the superconducting dome is to enhance the effective linear coupling induced by the broken order, shifting the dome's maximum into the ordered phase. Our theory quantitatively reproduces the three-dimensional experimental phase diagram in the space of carrier density, distance from the quantum critical point and temperature, and allows us to estimate microscopic parameters from the experimental data.

# Newly discovered magnetic phase: A brief review on Altermagnets

## 新发现的磁相: 地磁的简要回顾

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05377

arXiv:2412.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new magnetic phase, termed altermagnetism, has caught the attention of the magnetism and spintronics community. This newly discovered magnetic phenomenon differs from traditional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetic. It generally lacks net magnetization and is characterized by unusual non-relativistic spin-splitting and broken time-reversal symmetry. This leads to novel transport properties such as the anomalous Hall effect, the crystal Nernst effect, and spin-dependent phenomena that cannot be fully explained by traditional magnetic theories. Spin-dependent phenomena such as spin currents, spin-splitter torques, and high-frequency dynamics emerge as key characteristics in altermagnets. This paper reviews the main aspects pertaining to altermagnets by providing an overview of theoretical investigations and experimental realizations. We discuss the most recent developments in altermagnetism, its comparison to other magnetic orders, and future prospects for exploiting its unique properties in next-generation devices.

# A quantized anomalous Hall effect above 4.2 K in stacked topological insulator/magnet bilayers

## 堆叠的拓扑绝缘体/磁体双层中4.2 K以上的量子化异常霍尔效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05380

arXiv:2412.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized anomalous Hall effects (QAHEs) occur in remarkable electronic states which possess not only quantized Hall signals but in some cases regions of dissipationless electron transport. The initial demonstrations of a QAHE in a magnetically-doped topological insulator (TI) required temperatures below 100 mK, and since then a major focus of the field has been to increase the temperature scale. Here, we report quantized Hall signals up to 10 K (in what is known as the parity anomaly state) in TI/magnet bilayers made by mechanical assembly, rather than by conventional deposition techniques. This is a factor of 100 higher temperature than any previous realization of a QAHE in a proximity-coupled TI/magnet heterostructure made by deposition, and approximately twice the previous record for any QAHE system.

# Universal approach to light driven "superconductivity" via preformed pairs

## 通过预制对实现光驱动 “超导” 的通用方法

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05420

arXiv:2412.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there are many different mechanisms which have been proposed to understand the physics behind light induced "superconductivity", what seems to be common to the class of materials in which this is observed are strong pairing correlations, which are present in the normal state. Here we argue, that the original ideas of Eliashberg are applicable to such a pseudogap phase and that with exposure to radiation the fermions are redistributed to higher energies where they are less deleterious to pairing. What results then is a photo-induced state with dramatically enhanced number of nearly condensed fermion pairs. In this phase, because the a.c. conductivity, $\sigma(\omega) = \sigma_1(\omega) + i \sigma_2(\omega)$, is dominated by the bosonic contribution, it can be computed using conventional (Aslamazov Larkin) fluctuation theory. We, thereby, observe the expected fingerprint of this photoinduced "superconducting" state which is a $1/\omega$ dependence in $\sigma_2$ with fits to the data of the same quality as found for the so-called photo-enhanced (Drude) conductivity scenario. Here, however, we have a microscopic understanding of the characteristic low energy scale which appears in transport and which is necessarily temperature dependent. This approach also provides insight into recent observations of concomitant diamagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations suggest that the observed light-induced phase in these strongly paired superconductors has only short range phase coherence without long range superconducting order.

arXiv:2412.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational and magnetic properties of single-crystal uranium-thorium dioxide (UxTh1-xO2) with a full range of 0<1 is investigated. Thorium dioxide is a diamagnet whose thermal properties are governed by lattice vibration. The addition of paramagnetic uranium ion leads to the emergence of magnetic effects that alter the thermophysical properties noticeably even at room temperature. The interaction of phonons with magnetic moments of uranium 5f electrons mediated by magnetoelastic coupling results in an anomalous low-temperature thermal conductivity profile. Analysis of the magnetic susceptibility measurements indicates a uranium-concentration-dependent reduction in effective magnetic moment previously associated with the dynamic Jahn-Teller (DJT) effect. The T2g Raman peak position follows a nonlinear trend as a function of uranium concentration and hints that these Raman active optical modes play a role in either DJT or mediating quadrupole-quadrupole interactions. A first principle-based thermal transport model is implemented to explain the low-temperature transport measurements, where the anomalous reduction is attributed to phonon-spin resonant scattering. The interplay between spins and phonons is also captured using high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) measurements of phonon linewidths. Our results provide new insights into the phonon interactions with the magnetic excitations governing DJT effect and impacting the low-temperature thermal transport processes in this material system. These findings have implications for understanding low-temperature thermal transport and magnetic properties in advanced materials for information processing and energy applications.

# Dome-Shaped Superconducting Phase Diagram Linked to Charge Order in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$

arXiv:2412.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and charge order is a central focus in condensed matter research, with kagome lattice systems offering unique insights. The kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ ($T_{\rm c}$ ${\simeq}$ 6.5 K) exhibits a hierarchy of charge order transitions: primary ($T_{\rm co,I}$ ${\simeq}$ 400 K), secondary ($T_{\rm co,II}$ ${\simeq}$ 80 K), and an additional transition at ($T^{*}$ $\simeq$ 35 K). The transitions at $T_{\rm co,II}$ and $T^{*}$ are linked to electronic and magnetic responses as revealed by muon-spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments. However, the connection between superconductivity, charge order, and electronic responses has remained elusive. By employing magnetotransport and X-ray diffraction techniques under pressures of up to 40 GPa, we observe that $T_{\rm c}$ rises to 9 K at 2 GPa, remains nearly constant up to 12 GPa, and then decreases to 2 K at 40 GPa, resulting in a dome-shaped phase diagram. The resistivity anomaly at $T^{*}$ and magnetoresistance also exhibit a similar dome-shaped pressure dependence. Furthermore, we find that charge order transitions from long-range to short-range above 12 GPa, correlating with the suppression of $T_{\rm c}$, suggesting superconductivity is closely tied to the charge-ordered state. Specifically, $T_{\rm c}$ peaks when charge order and the normal-state electronic responses are optimized. In contrast to systems like the cuprates, transition metal dichalcogenides, and other kagome materials, where superconductivity typically competes with charge order, LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ displays a pronounced interdependence between these two phenomena. This distinctive behavior sheds new light on the connection between superconductivity and charge order, offering avenues for theoretical advancements in understanding superconductivity.

# Superconductivity-enhanced magnetic field noise

## 超导增强磁场噪声

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05465

arXiv:2412.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stray magnetic field noise outside a two-dimensional superconductor. Our considerations are motivated by recent experiments, which observed an enhancement in the magnetic field noise below the superconducting critical temperature based on the relaxation of diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers. Such enhancement is not captured by the standard two-fluid model for the superconducting state, recently proposed to explain such NV relaxometry experiments. Instead, we show that a microscopic BCS theory captures such an enhancement, and we compare with a similar theory and phenomenon, known as the Hebel-Schlicter peak (or coherence peak), observed in the relaxation of nuclear spins in the material. The primary difference is that the NV probes long-wavelength magnetic noise outside the sample, while the nuclear spin probes local hyperfine noise inside the sample. Accordingly, the noise probed by the NV depends on its height and can probe, in pristine samples, the superfluid coherence length. Finally, we discuss potential avenues for NVs to probe unconventional superconductivity via deviations from the above BCS theory.

arXiv:2412.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-layer CrPS$_{4}$ is a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material with excellent stability in ambient environment, which attracted significant interest in recent research. Here, via first-principles calculations, we show that 2D CrPS$_{4}$ hosts a variety of anomalous Hall transport phenomena, owing to its layer-dependent magnetism and symmetry character. Monolayer CrPS$_{4}$ can display a sizable linear anomalous Hall effect, while its nonlinear anomalous Hall response is forbidden. In contrast, bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ can produce pronounced intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall response from Berry-connection polarizability, in the absence of linear anomalous Hall effect. We clarify that the large peaks in these responses originate from gapped Dirac points in the band structure. Furthermore, we show that linear anomalous Hall effect can be induced and controlled in bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ by gate electric field or in-plane magnetic field, which break the spacetime inversion symmetry. Our findings unveil the interesting layer-dependent Hall transport physics in 2D CrPS$_{4}$ magnets, suggesting its potential in electronic and spintronic device applications.

Abstract: We demonstrate that domain walls built from bimeron chains (bc-DW) in two-dimensional systems constitute a spontaneously assembled medium that holds magnonic excitations along its direction. We prove that such magnons are topological, leading to protected edge states. We also verify the stability of the domain walls and its edge modes' resilience against disorder. Analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations support our findings.

# Strain-engineering spin-valley locking effect in altermagnetic monolayer with multipiezo properties

arXiv:2412.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, altermagnetism (AM) in condensed matter systems has attracted much attention due to the physical properties arising from the alternating spins in both real space and reciprocal space. In our work, we propose a stable monolayer Janus Nb2SeTeO with altermagnetic ground state and a new type of spin-valley locking (SVL) effect. The monolayer Janus Nb2SeTeO exhibits a mutipizeo effect with a large out-of-plane piezoelectricity and piezovalley effect with large valley polarization. The piezovalley effect is induced by the uniaxial strain effect in different directions, which contributes the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) in the AM system. Moreover, the compressive uniaxial strain could induce the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in the AM system, where the chirality of the dissipationless topological edge states could be manipulated by the direction of uniaxial strain. These manifest topological phase transitions could be realized via the piezovalley effect in the AM system. Furthermore, the AM quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) could be induced by the biaxial strain effect, which contributes the quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work reveals that strain-engineering technique could provide as an important method to tune the dissipationless edge states in monolayer Janus Nb2SeTeO. By designing the SVL effect could emerge new physics in AM systems, such as AVHE, QAHE and QSHE.

arXiv:2412.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets present a promising platform for spintronic applications due to their unique structural and electronic properties. The ability to electrostatically control their interlayer magnetic coupling between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases is particularly advantageous for the development of energy-efficient spintronic components. While effective in bilayer CrI3, achieving this control in other 2D magnets remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that bilayer Cr2Ge2Te6 can achieve efficient electrostatic control through interlayer hopping modulation. We show that an external electric field can effectively manipulate the FM-AFM phase transition when interlayer hopping is enhanced by pressure or sliding. We further develop a four-site interlayer hopping model, revealing that the phase transition is driven by a combined effect of on-site energy splitting and interlayer electronic hopping. These findings pave the way for designing novel, electrically tunable spintronic devices, offering substantial potential for energy-efficient information processing and storage.

# Identifying an effective model for the two-stage-Kondo regime: Numerical renormalization group results

arXiv:2412.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A composite impurity in a metal can explore different configurations, where its net magnetic moment may be screened by the host electrons. An example is the two-stage Kondo (TSK) system, where screening occurs at successively smaller energy scales. Alternatively, impurities may prefer a local singlet disconnected from the metal. This competition is influenced by the system's couplings. A double quantum dot T-shape geometry, where a "hanging" dot is connected to current leads only via another dot, allows experimental exploration of these regimes. Differentiating the two regimes has been challenging. This study provides a method to identify the TSK regime in such a geometry. The TSK regime requires a balance between the inter-dot coupling ($t_{01}$) and the coupling of the quantum dot connected to the Fermi sea ($\Gamma_0$). Above a certain ratio, the system transitions to a molecular regime, forming a local singlet with no Kondo screening. The study identifies a region in the $t_{01}$--$\Gamma_0$ parameter space where a pure TSK regime occurs. Here, the second Kondo stage properties can be described by a single impurity Anderson model with effective parameters. By examining the magnetic susceptibility of the hanging quantum dot, a single parameter, $\Gamma_{\rm eff}$, can simulate this susceptibility accurately. This effective model also provides the hanging quantum dot's spectral function accurately within a limited parameter range, defining the true TSK regime. Additionally, spin correlations between the quantum dots show universal behavior in this parameter range. These findings can guide experimental groups in selecting parameter values to place the system in either the TSK regime or the crossover to the molecular regime.

Abstract: Magnetoplumbites are one of the most broadly studied families of hexagonal ferrites, typically with high magnetic ordering temperatures, making them excellent candidates for permanent magnets. However, magnetic frustration was rarely observed in magnetoplumbites. Herein, we report the discovery, synthesis and characterization of the first Mn-based magnetoplumbite, as well as the first magnetoplumbite involving pnictogens (Sb), ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb). The Mn3+ (S = 2) cations, further confirmed by DC magnetic susceptibility and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, construct three geometrically frustrated sublattices, including Kagome, triangular and puckered honeycomb lattices. Magnetic properties measurements revealed strong antiferromagnetic spin-spin coupling as well as multiple low-temperature magnetic features. Heat capacity data did not show any prominent lambda-anomaly, suggesting minimal associated magnetic entropy. Moreover, neutron powder diffraction implied the absence of long-range magnetic ordering in KSb3Mn9O19 down to 3 K. However, several magnetic peaks were observed in RbSb3Mn9O19 at 3 K, corresponding to an incommensurate magnetic structure. Interestingly, strong diffuse scattering was seen in the neutron powder diffraction patterns of both compounds at low angles, and was analyzed by reverse Monte Carlo refinements, indicating short-range spin ordering related to frustrated magnetism as well as two-dimensional magnetic correlations in ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb).

arXiv:2412.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antisymmetric-type long-range exchange interaction between two ferromagnetic layers through a nonmagnetic layer, called antisymmetric interlayer exchange coupling (AIEC), has recently been discovered and attracted much attention. This paper reports that the AIEC is naturally built in synthetic antiferromagnets depending on the thin film growth condition. For the synthetic antiferromagnets consisting of Pt/Co/Ir/Co/Pt layers, two kinds of film growth parameters are examined: the effects of epitaxial growth and oblique incident of sputter-deposition. The present results indicate that the spatial fluctuations in thicknesses are one of the major sources inducing the AIEC while the epitaxial growth, which leads to the sharp interfaces and the uniformity in layer thicknesses, effectively suppresses the unexpected AIEC. In addition, the oblique sputter-deposition provides the large AIEC and the anisotropic distribution of AIEC direction in the case of textured films. The findings in this study provide key factors for designing the AIEC and is useful to develop emerging computing technologies with artificial three-dimensional topological magnetic structures.

arXiv:2412.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnBi2Te4 (MBT) is a typical magnetic topological insulator with an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Here we prepared ultra-thin MBT films with controlled anti-site defects and observed rich doping-dependent magnetic behaviors. We find in one-septuple-layer MBT films a ferrimagnetic ground state and in two-septuple-layer ones a kind of re-entrant ferromagnetism (FM) that disappears with increased Bi-on-Mn doping in the FM Mn-layers. This re-entrant behavior is attributed to a kind of symmetric exchange-bias effect that arises in the presence of both AFM and FM sub-systems due to the introduction of high-dense Mn-on-Bi anti-site defects. Furthermore, all MBT films display spin-glass-like behaviors. Our work demonstrates rich magnetic behaviors originating from the competing magnetic interactions between Mn spins at different lattice positions in MBT.

Abstract: We obtain in single van-der-Waals layer of MnBi2Te4 the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass (SG)/ferromagnet architecture, where the switch of individual spin states in the SG-like layer appears as the resistance switch behavior. The characteristic temperature of SG can be effectively tuned by fine-control of Bi-doping in the SG layer. A doping- and temperature-dependent phase diagram is established. We demonstrate the remote manipulation and detection of the states of individual Mn-layer spins by tunneling electrons in favor of the electron-phonon, spin-phonon, spin-transfer torque and spin-flip interactions among hot electrons, lattice and local spins, where the spin valve layer is even buried below two-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3. The integration of the SG state into spin valves opens the opportunity of realizing atomic-scale spintronics by integrating different degrees of freedom in two dimensional materials.

Abstract: Multiferroic materials, characterized by the coexisting of ferroelectric polarization (breaking spatial inversion symmetry) and magnetism (breaking time-reversal symmetry), with strong magnetoelectric coupling, are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Novel altermagnets, distinct from conventional magnets, have recently been revealed to exhibit unique spin polarization protected by crystal symmetry, which naturally overcomes the isolation of magnetism from ferroelectrics associated with spatial symmetry. In this study, we propose a novel class of type-III multiferroics, where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism are inherently interlocked by crystal symmetry, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. Through first-principles calculations, ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180{\deg} reversal of magnetic spin. This strong magnetoelectric coupling is further supported by the magneto-optical Kerr effect, revealing a new class of multiferroics with robust, symmetry-driven magnetoelectric coupling and providing a theoretical foundation for the design of next-generation spintronic devices leveraging altermagnetism.

Abstract: Two-Dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been the subject of extensive attention thanks to their unique properties and atomically thin structure. Because of its unprecedented room-temperature magnetic properties, iron-doped MoS2 (Fe:MoS2) is considered the next-generation quantum and magnetic material. It is essential to understand Fe:MoS2's thermal behavior since temperature and thermal load/activation are crucial for their magnetic properties and the current nano and quantum devices have been severely limited by thermal management. In this work, Fe:MoS2 is synthesized by doping Fe atoms into MoS2 using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis and a refined version of opto-thermal Raman technique is used to study the thermal transport properties of Fe:MoS2 in the forms of single (1L), bilayer (2L), and tri-layer (3L). In the Opto-thermal Raman technique, a laser is focused on the center of a thin film and used to measure the peak position of a Raman-active mode. The lateral thermal conductivity of 1-3L of Fe:MoS2 and the interfacial thermal conductance between Fe:MoS2 and the substrate were obtained by analyzing the temperature-dependent and power-dependent Raman measurement, laser power absorption coefficient, and laser spot sizes. We also characterized Fe:MoS2's thermal transport at high temperature, and calculated Fe:MoS2's thermal transport by density theory function. These findings will shed light on the thermal management and thermoelectric designs for Fe:MoS2 based nano and quantum electronic devices.

# The role of superconducting fitness in pairing from fluctuating order

## 超导适应度在波动顺序配对中的作用

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06156

arXiv:2412.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many unconventional superconductors the pairing interaction is believed to be mediated by a fluctuating order. Although this is typically taken to be magnetic in origin, the role of other fluctuating orders has recently been considered. In this work we examine the weak-coupling pairing interaction produced by a general fluctuating order, and seek to identify the leading pairing instability. For a given pairing channel, we show that the superconducting fitness with the associated static order appears prominently in the expression for the coupling constant. We consequently argue that fit gaps (for which the static order is not pair-breaking) should have an attractive interaction, whereas unfit gaps (for which the static order is pair-breaking) have a repulsive interaction. We propose a simple heuristic test for the tendency of a given pairing state to have an attractive interaction. We show the validity of this test in the case of pairing caused by fluctuating density-wave order, and use it to probe the superconducting state generated by a fluctuating noncolinear magnetic order on the pyrochlore lattice.

## 排斥束缚magnons的实验观察

arXiv:2412.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable composite objects, such as hadrons, nuclei, atoms, molecules and superconducting pairs, formed by attractive forces are ubiquitous in nature. By contrast, composite objects stabilized by means of repulsive forces were long thought to be theoretical constructions owing to their fragility in naturally occurring systems. Surprisingly, the formation of bound atom pairs by strong repulsive interactions has been demonstrated experimentally in optical lattices. Despite this success, repulsively bound particle pairs were believed to have no analogue in condensed matter owing to strong decay channels. Here we present spectroscopic signatures of repulsively bound three-magnon states and bound magnon pairs in the Ising-like chain antiferromagnet BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$. In large transverse fields, below the quantum critical point, we identify repulsively bound magnon states by comparing terahertz spectroscopy measurements to theoretical results for the Heisenberg-Ising chain antiferromagnet, a paradigmatic quantum many-body model. Our experimental results show that these high-energy repulsively bound magnon states are well separated from continua, exhibit significant dynamical responses and, despite dissipation, are sufficiently long-lived to be identified. As the transport properties in spin chains can be altered by magnon bound states, we envision such states could serve as resources for magnonics based quantum information processing technologies.

# The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, Majorana strong zero modes and SPT phases

## Ising双反射界面: $ \ mathbb{Z}_4 $ 对称性，Majorana强零模和SPT相位

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06377

arXiv:2412.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection operation with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. In an open geometry of the studied model, we identify two regimes that exhibit different degeneracy patterns. We discuss whether this is a manifestation of distinct fermion symmetry-protected topological orders protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry.

# Entanglement entropy for a type of scale-invariant states in two spatial dimensions and beyond: universal finite-size scaling

## 在两个空间维度及以后的一类尺度不变状态的纠缠熵: 通用有限尺寸缩放

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06396

arXiv:2412.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic scheme is proposed to investigate the entanglement entropy for a type of scale-invariant states, valid for orthonormal basis states in the ground state subspace of quantum many-body systems undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes in two spatial dimensions and beyond. It is argued that a contribution from the area law to the entanglement entropy is absent, since the closeness to the boundary between a subsystem and its environment is not well-defined, given that a permutation symmetry group with respect to the unit cells of degenerate ground state wave functions emerges. Three physical constraints imposed lead to a universal finite-system size scaling function in the dominant logarithmic contribution to the entanglement entropy. As a result, an abstract fractal underlying the ground state subspace is revealed, characterized by the fractal dimension. The latter in turn is identical to the number of type-B Goldstone modes for the orthonormal basis states. The prediction is numerically confirmed for the ${\rm SU}(2)$ spin-$s$ ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, the ${\rm SU}(2s+1)$ ferromagnetic model, and the staggered ${\rm SU}(3)$ spin-1 ferromagnetic biquadratic model.

arXiv:2412.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of sound propagation in a magnetized magnetic fluid containing ellipsoidal aggregates is proposed. The model quantitatively describes the geometry of the aggregates formed from nanoparticles. Expressions for the attenuation coefficient and the sound velocity have been derived, taking into account dipole-dipole interaction between the aggregates. The model demonstrates good agreement with the experimental data. In limiting cases, the derived expressions reduce to classical ones, and the fitting parameters are merely geometric characteristics of the aggregates. The developed model enables the determination of aggregate sizes and the distances between them from an experiment that can be conducted without direct contact. The results obtained can also be used to analyze the field dependencies of acoustic properties and to model the kinetics of aggregate growth in a magnetic field.

# Oxygen Vacancy-Induced Monoclinic Dead Layers in Ferroelectric $Hf_xZr_{1-x}O_2$ With Metal Electrodes

arXiv:2412.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze dead layer comprising non-polar monoclinic (m) phase in $Hf_xZr_{1-x}O_2$ (HZO)-based ferroelectric (FE) material using first principles analysis. We show that with widely used tungsten (W) metal electrode, the spatial distribution of the oxygen vacancy across the cross-section plays a key role in dictating the favorability of m- phase formation at the metal-HfO2 interface. The energetics are also impacted by the polarization direction as well as the depth of oxygen vacancy, i.e., position along the thickness. At the metal - $HfO_2$ interface, when polarization points towards the metal and vacancy forms at trigonally bonded O atomic site, both interfacial relaxation and m- phase formation can lead to dead layers. For vacancies at other oxygen atomic sites and polarization direction, dead layer is formed due to sole interfacial relaxation with polar phase. We also establish the relative favorability of the m-phase dead layer for different Zr concentrations (x=1 and x = 0.5) and metal electrodes. According to our analysis, 50% Zr doped $HfO_2$ exhibits less probability of m-phase dead layer formation compared to pure $HfO_2$. Moreover, with electrodes consisting of noble metal (Pt, Pd, Os, Ru, Rh), m-phase dead layer formation is less likely. Therefore, for these metals, dead layer forms mainly due to the interfacial relaxation with polar phase.

# Real-space study of zero-field correlation in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene

## 四方菱形石墨烯零场相关性的实空间研究

arXiv:2412.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene (RG) has emerged as a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, such as quantum magnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects. Despite its potential, atomic-scale investigations of RG remain limited, hindering a detailed microscopic understanding of the origins of these correlated states. In this study, we employ scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy to probe the intrinsic electronic states in trilayer and tetralayer RG. We identify a correlated insulating state with a 17 meV gap at the charge neutrality point in tetralayer RG, which is absent in the trilayer configuration. This gap is suppressed by applying a perpendicular magnetic field or doping the charge carrier density and does not exhibit inter-valley coherence patterns. We attribute this phenomenon to a symmetry-broken layer antiferromagnetic state, characterized by ferrimagnetic ordering in the outermost layers and antiferromagnetic coupling between them. To further investigate this magnetic correlated state, we conduct local scattering experiments. Within the correlated regime, a bound state emerges around a non-magnetic impurity but is absent near magnetic impurities, suggesting that non-magnetic doping induces a spin texture in the ferrimagnetic surface layers. Outside the correlated regime, Friedel oscillations are observed, allowing precise determination of the band dispersion in tetralayer RG. These findings provide atomic-scale evidences of zero-field correlations in RG and may be extended to study other exotic phases in RG.

# Quantum Critical Scaling of Specific Heat in a Quasicrystal

arXiv:2412.06558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strongly correlated systems, interactions give rise to critical fluctuations surrounding the quantum critical point (QCP) of a quantum phase transition. Quasicrystals allow the study of quantum critical phenomena in aperiodic systems with frustrated magnetic interactions. Here, we study the magnetic field and temperature scaling of the low-temperature specific heat for the quantum critical Yb-Au-Al quasicrystal. We devise a scaling function that encapsulates the limiting behaviors as well as the area where the system goes from a temperature-limited to a field-limited quantum critical region, where magnetic field acts as a cutoff for critical fluctuations. The zero-field electronic specific heat is described by a power-law divergence, ${C_{el}/T \propto T^{-0.54}}$, aligning with previously observed ac-susceptibility and specific heat measurements. The field dependence of the electronic specific heat at high magnetic fields shows a similar power-law ${C_{el}/T \propto B^{-0.50}}$. In the zero-field and low-field region, we observe two small but distinct anomalies in the specific heat, located at 0.7 K and 2.1 K.

# Towards novel tunability schemes for hybrid ferromagnetic transmon qubits

## 关于混合铁磁transmon量子位的新型可调谐方案

arXiv:2412.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux tuning of qubit frequencies in superconducting quantum processors is fundamental for implementing single and multi-qubit gates in quantum algorithms. Typical architectures involve the use of DC or fast RF lines. However, these lines introduce significant heat dissipation and undesirable decoherence mechanisms, leading to a severe bottleneck for scalability. Among different solutions to overcome this issue, we propose integrating tunnel Superconductor-Insulating-thin superconducting interlayer-Ferromagnet-Superconductor Josephson junctions (SIsFS JJs) into a novel transmon qubit design, the so-called ferrotransmon. SIsFS JJs provide memory properties due to the presence of ferromagnetic barriers and preserve at the same time the low-dissipative behavior of tunnel-insulating JJs, thus promoting an alternative tuning of the qubit frequency. In this work, we discuss the fundamental steps towards the implementation of this hybrid ferromagnetic transmon. We will give a special focus on the design, simulations, and preliminary experimental characterization of superconducting lines to provide in-plane magnetic fields, fundamental for an on-chip control of the qubit frequencies in the ferrotransmon.

arXiv:2412.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subject of this study is spin transport through an orbital belonging to a magnetic molecule, connected to two leads, and coupled via exchange interaction with the precessing anisotropic molecular spin in a constant magnetic field. The expressions for spin current components, noise of $z$-polarized spin current, spin-transfer torque, Gilbert damping and other torque coefficients are obtained using the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's functions technique. The precession of the molecular spin, and hence, the inelastic tunnelling processes involving spin-flip events between molecular quasienergy levels, driven by this precession, can be controlled by the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy parameter. By setting the Larmor precession frequency, the tilt angle of molecular magnetization with respect to the magnetic field, and the magnetic anisotropy parameter, one can modulate the spin-current components and noise, spin-transfer torque and related torque coefficients. Moreover, the dc-spin current and spin-transfer torque components provide the quasienergy level structure in the orbital and the torque vanishes for a suppressed molecular spin precession, obtained by proper adjustment of the anisotropy parameter and magnetic field, allowing to reveal the anisotropy parameter via a dc-spin current or torque measurement. The results of the study show that spin transport and spin-transfer torque generated on the anisotropic molecular spin can be manipulated by the uniaxial anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin even in the absence of the magnetic field.

# Local Magnetoelectric Effects as a Predictor of Surface Magnetic Order

## 局部磁电效应作为表面磁序的预测因子

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06625

arXiv:2412.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use symmetry analysis and density functional theory to show that changes in magnetic order at a surface with respect to magnetic order in the bulk can be generically determined by considering local magnetoelectric responses of the crystal. Specifically, analysis of the atomic-site magnetoelectric responses, or equivalently the corresponding local magnetic multipoles, can be used to predict all surface magnetic modifications arising purely from symmetry lowering via termination of the bulk magnetic order. This analysis applies even in materials with no bulk magnetoelectric response or surface magnetization. We then demonstrate our arguments for two example antiferromagnets, metallic $\mathrm{CuMnAs}$ and rock-salt $\mathrm{NiO}$. We find that the $(010)$ and $(1\bar{1}0)$ surfaces of $\mathrm{CuMnAs}$ and $\mathrm{NiO}$ respectively exhibit a series of antiferroically, as well as roughness-sensitive, ferroically ordered, modifications of the surface magnetic dipole moments, via canting or changes in sublattice magnitude, consistent with the bulk ordering of the magnetic multipoles. Our findings demonstrate a universal bulk-boundary correspondance allowing the general prediction of minimal possible surface and interface magnetic modifications, even in non-magnetoelectric materials. Furthermore, it paves the way for more accurate interpretations of a wide variety of surface-sensitive measurements.

# On the angular dependence of anomalous Hall current

## 关于异常霍尔电流的角度依赖性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06630

arXiv:2412.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse current (j_H) due to anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is usually assumed to be perpendicular to the magnetization (m) in ferromagnetic materials, which governs the experiments in spintronics. Generally, this assumption is derived from a continuum model, where the crystal's discrete symmetry is effectively represented by the concept of an effective mass from the band structure. In this paper, we calculate the spin transport through the nonmagnetic metal (NM) | ferromagnetic metal (FM) interfaces and find that the corresponding Hall current is generally not perpendicular to m with only a few exceptions at high symmetry crystal orientations. The calculation illustrates the breakdown of j_H={\theta}m{\times}j_c, where {\theta} denotes the anomalous Hall angle and j_c represents the injecting charge current. An analytical formula based on the discrete symmetry of the solid can describe this effect well. In this framework, the leading order corresponds to the conventional AHE, while higher-order terms account for deviations in the Hall current. Additionally, we identify the presence of a chiral anomalous Hall effect (CAHE) at interface with odd rotational symmetry (e.g., C_{3v}) and the higher-order terms can even dominate the AHE by constructing superlattices. The general existence of hidden chirality in spin transport is also revealed, with a specific focus on interface chirality (IC). Our results highlight the significance of discrete atomic positions in solids for spin transport, which extends beyond the conventional continuum model. Moreover, considering the important application of the AHE in spintronics and the wide existence of the interfaces in the devices, the breakdown of j_H={\theta}m{\times}j_c suggests that all experimental measurements related to the AHE should be re-evaluated.

arXiv:2412.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets with topological insulators or heavy metals holds great potential for realizing next-generation spintronic memory devices. However, achieving high-efficiency SOT switching of monolayer vdW magnets at room temperature poses a significant challenge, particularly without an external magnetic field. Here, we show field-free, deterministic, and nonvolatile SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization in the monolayer, diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS), Fe-doped MoS2(Fe:MoS2) at up to 380 K with a current density of $7\times10^4 A cm^{-2}$. The in situ doping of Fe into monolayer MoS2 via chemical vapor deposition and the geometry-induced strain in the crystal break the rotational switching symmetry in Fe:MoS2, promoting field-free SOT switching by generating out-of-plane spins via spin-to-spin conversion. An apparent anomalous Hall effect (AHE) loop shift at a zero in-plane magnetic field verifies the existence of z spins in Fe:MoS2, inducing an antidamping-like torque that facilitates field-free SOT switching. A strong topological Hall effect (THE) was also observed, attributed to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), reducing the energy barrier for SOT switching. This field-free SOT application using a 2D ferromagnetic monolayer provides a new pathway for developing highly power-efficient spintronic memory devices.

YIG is a compelling material for quantum technologies due to its unique magnetic and optical properties; however, experiments involving YIG have primarily been limited to millimeter-scale spheres. The successful nanofabrication of YIG structures opens new avenues for advancing quantum technology applications. Notably, the ability to co-localize magnons, phonons, and optical photons within a nanostructured environment paves the way for novel approaches in quantum information processing, including quantum wavelength transduction and enhanced magnon-photon interactions. This work marks a significant step toward integrating YIG-based devices into scalable quantum platforms.

arXiv:2412.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs has been a long standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using the best available data, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarfs forms. Crystallization dynamos, if operative, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.

Abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJs) are emerging as promising components for stochastic units in neuromorphic computing, owing to their tunable random switching behavior. Conventional MTJ control methods, such as spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT), often require substantial power. Here, we introduce the voltage-controlled exchange coupling (VCEC) mechanism, enabling switching between antiparallel and parallel states in sMTJs with an ultralow power consumption of only 40 nW, approximately two orders of magnitude lower than conventional STT-based sMTJs. This mechanism yields a sigmoid-shaped output response, making it ideally suited for neuromorphic computing applications. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of integrating VCEC with the SOT current control, offering an additional dimension for magnetic state manipulation. This work marks the first practical demonstration of VCEC effect in sMTJs, highlighting its potential as a low-power control solution for probabilistic bits in advanced computing systems.

Abstract: The search for highly coherent degrees of freedom in noisy solid-state environments is a major challenge in condensed matter. In disordered dipolar systems, such as magnetically doped insulators, compact clusters of two-level systems (TLS) have recently been shown to have significantly longer coherence times than typical single TLS. Coupling weakly to their environment, they sense and probe its many-body dynamics through the induced dephasing. However, it has remained an open question whether further mechanisms exist that protect the coherence of such solid-state qubits. Here we show that symmetric clusters of few TLS couple even more weakly to their surroundings, making them highly sensitive quantum sensors of slow many-body dynamics. Furthermore, we explore their use as qubits for quantum information storage, detailing the techniques required for their preparation and manipulation. Our findings elucidate the role of symmetry in enhancing quantum coherence in disordered and noisy systems, opening a route toward a sensitive experimental probe of many-body quasi-localization dynamics as well as the development of quantum technologies in solid-state systems.

Abstract: The pseudogap phenomena have been a long-standing mystery of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. The pseudogap in the electron-doped cuprates has been attributed to band folding due to antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range order or short-range correlation. We performed an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of the electron-doped cuprates Pr$_{1.3-x}$La$_{0.7}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ showing spin-glass, disordered AFM behaviors, and superconductivity at low temperatures and, by measurements with fine momentum cuts, found that the gap opens on the unfolded Fermi surface rather than the AFM Brillouin zone boundary. The gap did not show a node, following the full symmetry of the Brillouin zone, and its magnitude decreased from the zone-diagonal to ($\pi$,0) directions, opposite to the hole-doped case. These observations were reproduced by cluster dynamical-mean-field-theory (CDMFT) calculation, which took into account electron correlation precisely within a (CuO$_2$)$_4$ cluster. The present experimental and theoretical results are consistent with the mechanism that electron or hole doping into a Mott insulator creates an in-gap band that are separated from the upper or lower Hubbard band by the pseudogap.

Abstract: We study a hybrid structure of a ferromagnetic-insulator and a superconductor connected by a weak link, which accommodates Andreev bound states whose spin degeneracy is lifted due to the exchange interaction with the ferromagnet. The resultant spin-resolved energy levels realize a two-state quantum system, provided that a single electron is trapped in the bound state, i.e., an Andreev spin qubit. The qubit state can be manipulated by controlling the magnetization dynamics of the ferromagnet, which mediates the coupling between external fields and the qubit. In particular, our hybrid structure provides a simple platform to manipulate and control the spin qubit using spintronic techniques. By employing a modified Hahn spin echo protocol for the magnetization dynamics, we show that our Andreev spin qubit can realize a nonadiabatic geometric gate.

Abstract: In metals, electrons in a magnetic field undergo cyclotron motion, leading to oscillations in physical properties called quantum oscillations. This phenomenon has never been seen in a robust insulator because there are no mobile electrons. We report the first exception to this rule. We study a Mott insulator on a kagome lattice which does not order magnetically down to milli-Kelvin temperatures despite antiferromagnetic interactions. We observe a plateau at magnetization equal to 1/9 Bohr magneton per magnetic ion, accompanied by oscillations in the magnetic torque, reminiscent of quantum oscillations in metals. The temperature dependence obeys Fermi distribution. These phenomena are consistent with a quantum spin liquid state whose excitations are fermionic spinons with a Dirac-like spectrum coupled to an emergent gauge field.

Abstract: We study interaction-mediated magnetism on the surface of ABC-multilayer graphene driven by its zero-energy topological flat bands. Using the random-phase approximation we treat onsite Hubbard repulsion and find multiple competing magnetic states, due to both intra- and inter-valley scattering, with the latter causing an enlarged magnetic unit cell. At half-filling and when the Hubbard repulsion is weak, we observe two different ferromagnetic orders. Once the Hubbard repulsion becomes more realistic, new ferrimagnetic orders arise with distinct incommensurate intra- or inter-valley scattering vectors depending on interaction strength and doping, leading to a multitude of competing magnetic states.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamical stability and real time dynamics of the two-types of ferrodark solitons (FDSs) which occur as topological magnetic domain walls in the easy-plane phase of a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The type-I FDS has positive inertial mass and exhibits a single dynamical instability that generates in plane spin winding, causing polar-core spin vortex dipoles. The positive inertial mass leads to the elastic oscillations of the soliton under transverse perturbations. The type-II FDS has negative inertial mass and exhibits a snake instability and a spin-twist instability, with the latter involving the generation of out of plane spin winding. Distinct from the normal dynamics of negative mass solitons under long wave length transverse perturbations, the snake instability does not lead to the type-II FDS breaking down. Instead, segments of the type-II FDS convert to type-I and mass vortex dipoles are produced. The resulting hybridized-chain of the two soliton types and vortices exhibits complex 2D soliton dynamics at long times while the vortices remain confined and the topological structure of a magnetic domain wall is preserved.

Abstract: Femtosecond laser pulses can be used to induce ultrafast changes of the magnetization in magnetic materials. Several microscopic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observations, including the transport of ultrashort spin-polarized hot-electrons (SPHE). Such ultrafast spin currents find growing interest because of the recent challenges in ultrafast spintronics however they are only poorly characterized. One of the key challenges is to characterize the spin-polarized ultrafast currents and the microscopic mechanisms behind SPHE induced manipulation of the magnetization, especially in the case of technologically relevant ferrimagnetic alloys. Here, we have used a combined approach using time- and element-resolved X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and theoretical calculations based on atomistic spin-dynamics simulations to address the ultrafast transfer of the angular momentum from spin-polarized currents into ferrimagnetic Fe74Gd26 films and the concomitant reduction of sub-lattice magnetization. Our study shows that using a Co/Pt multilayer as a polarizer in a spin-valve structure, the SPHE drives the demagnetization of the two sub-lattices of the Fe74Gd26 film. This behaviour is explained based on two physical mechanisms, i.e., spin transfer torque and thermal fluctuations induced by the SPHE. We provide a quantitative description of the heat transfer of the ultrashort SPHE pulse to the Fe74Gd26 films, as well as the degree of spin-polarization of the SPHE current density responsible for the observed magnetization dynamics. Our work finally characterizes the spin-polarization of the SPHEs revealing unexpected opposite spin polarization to the Co magnetization, explaining our experimental results.

Abstract: The idea to extract information on magnetically different phases from magnetic measurements is very attractive and many efforts have been made in this area. One of the most popular direction is to use the Preisach model formalism to analyze the 2D Preisach distribution function (PDF) obtained either from first order reversal curves (FORC) or minor loops. Here we present an alternative a much simpler procedure - the analysis of the derivative of the saturation magnetization loop, the differential susceptibility curve. It follows the Lorentzian shape with very high accuracy for ferromagnetic polycrystalline materials. This allows decomposing any differential susceptibility curve of a complex multi-phase material into individual components representing different magnetic phases by Lorenzian peaks - in the same way as it is done in X-ray analysis of materials. We show that the minor differential susceptibility curves also have the Lorenzian shape that can facilitate calculation of the Preisach distribution function from the experimental curves and reduce noise in the resulting PDF.

Using high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we design and predict tetragonal vdW-layered quantum materials in the MPd$_5$I$_2$ structure (M=Ga, In and 3d transition metals).

Among them, TiPd$_5$I$_2$ and InPd$_5$I$_2$ host a pair of Dirac points and likely an additional strong topological insulator state for the band manifolds just above and below the top valence band, respectively, with their single layers hosting or near quantum spin Hall states. CrPd$_5$I$_2$ is a ferromagnet with a large out-of-plane magneto-anisotropy energy, desirable for rare-earth-free permanent magnets.

Abstract: A Kekul\'e lattice is an exotic, distorted lattice structure exhibiting alternating bond lengths, distinguished from naturally formed atomic crystals. Despite its evident applicability, the formation of a Kekul\'e lattice from topological solitons in magnetic systems has remained elusive. Here, we propose twisted bilayer easy-plane N\'eel antiferromagnets as a promising platform for achieving a "Meron Kekul\'e lattice"--a distorted topological soliton lattice comprised of antiferromagnetic merons as its lattice elements. We demonstrate that the cores of these merons are stabilized into the Kekul\'e-O pattern with different intracell and intercell bond lengths across moir\'e supercells, thereby forming a Meron Kekul\'e lattice. Moreover, the two bond lengths of the Meron Kekul\'e lattice can be fine-tuned by adjusting the twist angle and specifics of the interlayer exchange coupling, suggesting extensive control over the meron lattice configuration in contrast to conventional magnetic systems. These discoveries pave the way for exploring topological solitons with distinctive Kekul\'e attributes.

arXiv:2410.16003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real-time dynamics of local magnetic moments exchange coupled to a metallic system of conduction electrons is subject to dissipative friction even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Phenomenologically, this is usually described by a local Gilbert damping constant. Here, we use both linear response theory and adiabatic response theory to derive the spin friction microscopically for a generic single-band tight-binding model of the electronic structure. The resulting Gilbert damping is time-dependent and nonlocal. For a one-dimensional model, we compare the emergent relaxation dynamics as obtained from LRT and ART against each other and against the full solution of the microscopic equations of motion and demonstrate the importance of nonlocality, while the time dependence turns out to be irrelevant. In two dimensions and for a few magnetic moments in different geometries, it is found that the inclusion of nonlocal Gilbert damping can counterintuitively lead to longer relaxation times. Besides the distance dependence, the directional dependence of the nonlocal Gilbert damping turns out as very important. Our results are based on an expression relating the nonlocal Gilbert damping to the nonlocal tight-binding density of states close to the Fermi energy. This is exact in case of noninteracting electrons. Effects due to electronic correlations are studied within the random-phase approximation. For the Hubbard model at half filling and with increasing interaction strength, we find a strong enhancement of the nonlocality of spin friction.

arXiv:2410.23564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of Anderson localization in two-dimensional (2D) electrons and holes in the bulk of HgTe quantum wells with a semimetallic spectrum and under strong disorder. In contrast, the one-dimensional (1D) edge channels, arising from the spectrum's inversion, demonstrate remarkable robustness against disorder due to topological protection. Strong disorder induces a mobility gap in the bulk, enabling access to the 1D edge states and thereby realizing the two-dimensional topological Anderson insulator (TAI) state. Nonlocal transport measurements confirm the emergence of topologically protected edge channels. The TAI state appears to be very sensitive to an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the sample. Firstly, a small magnetic field of 30mT breaks the topological protection of 1D edge channels, thus turning the system into an ordinary Anderson insulator. Secondly, the magnetic field of 0.5T delocalizes 2D bulk electrons, transforming the system into a quantum Hall liquid.

arXiv:2411.04089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.

Abstract: We report the successful growth of CeCuSi single crystals using a metallic flux method and the physical properties using structural, magnetic, electrical transport, optical, and heat capacity measurements. CeCuSi crystallizes in a hexagonal-bar shape, and single crystal x-ray diffraction confirms the ZrBeSi-type structure (space group $P6_{3}/mmc$). CeCuSi orders ferromagnetically below $T_\textrm{C}=15.5$ K with easy magnetization direction within the basal plane. The Ce$^{3+}$ ions are situated within a triangular lattice with a point group of $D_{3d}$. We perform a detailed crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility, the Schottky anomaly in heat capacity, and the Raman-active excitations. The results indicate a ground state doublet with magnetic moment primarily in the basal plane, and a ferromagnetic interaction along both directions. The exponential behavior in resistivity and in heat capacity below $T_\textrm{C}$ can also be well explained by the ferromagnetic magnon model. We found that CeCuSi does not exhibit the CEF hard axis ordering observed in many ferromagnetic Kondo lattice (FM-KL) compounds. Our CEF analysis suggests that the exchange interactions along both axes are ferromagnetic, potentially explaining the absence of hard-axis ordering.

# Hidden altermagnetism

Abstract: Hidden spin polarization (HSP) with zero net spin polarization in total but non-zero local spin polarization has been proposed in certain nonmagnetic centrosymmetric compounds, where the individual sectors forming the inversion partners are all inversion asymmetry. Here, we extend this idea to antiferromagnetic materials with $PT$ symmetry (the joint symmetry of space inversion symmetry ($P$) and time-reversal symmetry ($T$)), producing zero net spin polarization in total, but either of the two inversion-partner sectors possesses altermagnetism, giving rise to non-zero local spin polarization in the real space, dubbed "hidden altermagnetism". By first-principle calculations, we predict that $PT$-symmetric bilayer $\mathrm{Cr_2SO}$ can serve as a possible candidate showing altermagnetic HSP. By applying an external electric field to break the global $P$ symmetry, the hidden altermagnetism can be separated and observed experimentally. Our works extend the hidden physics, and will also advance the theoretical and experimental search for new type of spin-polarized materials.

Abstract: Complex ferromagnetic oxides such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) offer a pathway for creating energy efficient spintronic devices with new functionalities. LSMO exhibits high-temperature ferromagnetism, half metallicity, sharp resonance linewidth, low damping and a large anisotropic magnetoresistance response. Combined with Pt, a proven material with high spin-charge conversion efficiency, LSMO can potentially be used to create robust nano-oscillators. Here, we employed the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and spin-pumping FMR measurements to investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin transport in NdGaO3(110)/LSMO(15 nm)/Pt(0 and 5 nm) thin films at temperatures ranging from 300K to 90K. We find that the bilayer system exhibits a low magnetic damping (0.002), small linewidth (12Oe) and a large spin Hall angle ( 3.2%) at 170K, making it the optimum working temperature for spin orbit torque oscillators based on this system.

Abstract: We investigate through first-principles calculations rutile CoF$_2$ as an altermagnetic material. It is confirmed that there are two antiparallel magnetic moments of Co ions in the unit cell and the magnetic easy axis is in the z axis. A giant nonrelativstic spin splitting is observed near the valence band edge (valence band maximum) and there are ideal flat bands at the valence band edge along the [110] directions in the Brillouin zone. The giant nonrelativstic spin splitting and the band-edge flat bands are both robust against the spin-orbits coupling. More importantly, these band-edge flat bands can induce two-dimensional hole gases in two different planes. Applying a magnetic field in the xy plane, there will appear Landau levels and quantum Hall effects can be achieved for both of the spin channels. When the magnetic field is along the diagonal directions, quantum Hall effects can be induced for one spin and there is a longitudinal conductivity for the other spin.

Abstract: We theoretically and numerically investigate Chern vector insulators and topological surface states in a three-dimensional lattice, based on phase-delayed temporal-periodic interactions within the tight-binding model. These Floquet interactions break time-reversal symmetry, effectively inducing a gauge field analogous to magnetic flux. This gauge field results in Chern numbers in all spatial dimensions, collectively forming the Chern vector. This vector characterizes the topological phases and signifies the emergence of robust surface states. Numerically, we observe these states propagating unidirectionally without backscattering on all open surfaces of the three-dimensional system. Our work paves the way for breaking time-reversal symmetry and realizing three-dimensional Chern vector topological insulators using temporal-periodic Floquet techniques.

# Violation of Ferromagnetic Ordering of Energy Levels in Spin Rings for the Singlet

arXiv:2307.12773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a violation of the ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels'' conjecture (FOEL) for even length spin rings. The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L>4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture.
  Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.

# Enhancing fidelity in teleportation of a two-qubit state via a quantum communication channel formed by spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg trimer chains due to a magnetic field

Abstract: We demonstrate that two independent spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg trimer chains provide an effective platform for the quantum teleportation of any entangled two-qubit state through the quantum communication channel formed by two Heisenberg dimers. The reliability of this quantum channel is assessed by comparing the concurrences, which quantify a strength of the bipartite entanglement of the initial input state and the readout output state. Additionally, we rigorously calculate quantities fidelity and average fidelity to evaluate the quality of the teleportation protocol depending on temperature and magnetic field. It is evidenced that the efficiency of quantum teleportation of arbitrary entangled two-qubit state through this quantum communication channel can be significantly enhanced by moderate magnetic fields. This enhancement can be attributed to the magnetic-field-driven transition from a quantum antiferromagnetic phase to a quantum ferrimagnetic phase, which supports realization of a fully entangled quantum channel suitable for efficient quantum teleportation. The polymeric trimer chains Cu3(P2O6OH)2 are proposed as an experimental resource of this quantum communication channel, which provides an efficient platform for realization of the quantum teleportation up to moderate temperatures 40 K and extremely high magnetic fields 80 T.

arXiv:2412.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores a novel approach to mitigating turbulence in fusion plasmas through spatially modulated plasma profiles. By imposing a harmonic modulation on plasma parameters, we introduce conditions that alter the propagation characteristics of turbulent and MHD waves, a primary source of transport and instabilities in fusion devices. This modulation approach resembles bandgap formation in solid-state and photonic crystals, where spatial periodicity suppresses wave propagation within specific frequency bands. The mathematical framework developed here essentially resembles the parametric resonance of the harmonic oscillator. It reveals how a controlled spatial variation of turbulent wave phase velocity can effectively attenuate turbulence and instabilities. Several methods for implementing this modulation in plasma, including RF waves, static magnetic field perturbations, and modulated density profiles, are proposed as potential paths for achieving stable confinement. This concept could provide a versatile and potentially more controllable alternative to existing turbulence suppression techniques, with the goal of improving stability and confinement across a variety of magnetized fusion configurations.

arXiv:2412.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single-handedness of biomolecules is a characteristic feature of life on Earth, yet achieving and maintaining a homochiral prebiotic network is a significant challenge. In our previous studies, we reached homochirality in an RNA precursor, ribo-aminooxazoline (RAO), using magnetized magnetite surfaces as chiral reagents, due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. We further demonstrated that RAO can induce net magnetization on previously demagnetized surfaces, indicating a self-reinforcing feedback between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces. However, these processes depend on spin interactions that generally weaken at higher temperatures, raising concerns about the robustness of our mechanisms in natural settings. Additionally, the temperature dependence of CISS remains poorly understood. To address these questions, we investigated the temperature dependence of chirality-induced magnetization. Contrary to classical expectations, we observed a significant increase in induced net magnetization with increasing temperatures, suggesting a phonon-assisted process. Concurrently, we noted a corresponding increase in the relative yield of RAO during its prebiotic synthesis. Our results support a vibronic contribution to CISS and indicate that spin-controlled processes leading to RNA homochirality can occur reliably and effectively over a range of temperatures likely present in prebiotic environments.

# Energy Spectrum of Lost Alpha Particles in Magnetic Mirror Confinement

## 磁镜约束中丢失的 α粒子的能谱

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05890

arXiv:2412.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a magnetic mirror fusion reactor, capturing the energy of fusion-produced alpha particles is essential to sustaining the reaction. However, since alpha particles are born at energies much higher than the confining potential, a substantial fraction are lost due to pitch-angle scattering before they can transfer their energy to the plasma via drag. The energy of prematurely lost alpha particles can still be captured through direct conversion, but designing an effective mechanism requires a description of the energies and times at which they become deconfined. Here we present the first-ever analytical solutions for the loss velocity, energy, and time distributions of alpha particles in a magnetic mirror. After obtaining the Fokker-Planck model of the Landau collision operator, we asymptotically solve for the orthogonal eigenfunctions of the Legendre operator with homogeneous boundary conditions to reveal an easily interpretable closed-form solution. Our framework is extremely general and can in principle be applied to any high-energy species, subject to any applied potential, in the low collisionality, modest potential regime for any mirror ratio R > 1, making this work broadly applicable to existing mirror devices.

Abstract: Numerical modeling of the interaction process of two counter-streaming supersonic plasma flows with an arched magnetic field configuration in the regime of a magnetic Mach number of the order of unity $M_m \sim 1$ is carried out. The flows were launched from the bases of the arch along the direction of the magnetic field. It is shown that the interaction has non-equilibrium and non-stationary nature. It is accompanied by an expansion of the resulting magnetic plasma arch due to $E \times B$ drift with the formation of a region with oppositely directed magnetic fields, in which magnetic reconnection is observed. In the subcritical regime Mm < 1 the reconnection process is slow, and in the overcritical one Mm > 1 it is more intense and leads to plasma turbulization. Filamentation of flows due to the development of Weibel instability, as well as excitation of surface waves near the ion-cyclotron frequency on the surface of the plasma tube are also observed. The modeling was carried out for the parameters of an experiment planned for the near future, which made it possible to formulate the conditions for observing the effects discovered in the modeling.

Abstract: The possibility of exciting stationary solitons due to the Brewster effect is investigated. The analysis is performed by computing the transmission coefficient of an electromagnetic monochromatic wave obliquely incident on the optical system and linearly polarized with the transverse-electric polarization. The optical system is supposed to be surrounded by a vacuum. Two different optical systems are studied. First, the system under consideration is assumed to be composed of the junction of a single dispersive layer with a linear electromagnetic response and a single nonlinear layer exhibiting Kerr nonlinearity. The obtained results suggest the excitation of stationary solitons in the nonlinear layer induced by the occurrence of the Brewster phenomenon in the linear medium. The second system is considered as a single Kerr nonlinear layer. The Brewster effect is observed for both self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities, which leads to the excitation of soliton states within the nonlinear layer. The Brewster-angle dependence of the intensity of the incident electromagnetic wave is also shown. Finally, the excitation of omnidirectional solitons in the case of single nonlinear layers is discussed. It is shown that matching the magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium and the nonlinear layer leads to maximum transmission states, independent of the incidence angle, for the input-intensity value that causes the homogenization of the electric permittivity.

Abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJs) are emerging as promising components for stochastic units in neuromorphic computing, owing to their tunable random switching behavior. Conventional MTJ control methods, such as spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT), often require substantial power. Here, we introduce the voltage-controlled exchange coupling (VCEC) mechanism, enabling switching between antiparallel and parallel states in sMTJs with an ultralow power consumption of only 40 nW, approximately two orders of magnitude lower than conventional STT-based sMTJs. This mechanism yields a sigmoid-shaped output response, making it ideally suited for neuromorphic computing applications. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of integrating VCEC with the SOT current control, offering an additional dimension for magnetic state manipulation. This work marks the first practical demonstration of VCEC effect in sMTJs, highlighting its potential as a low-power control solution for probabilistic bits in advanced computing systems.

Abstract: Conventional electromagnetic induction-based current transformers suffer from issues such as bulky and complex structures, slow response times, and low safety levels. Consequently, researchers have explored combining various sensing technologies with optical fibers to develop optical current transformers that could become the primary choice for power systems in the future. With the maturation of optoelectronic technology, optical current transformers have emerged.

This review categorizes optical current transformers based on different principles, including all-fiber current transformers, those based on magnetostrictive effects, magneto-optic effects, and thermal effects. It also discusses their principles, structures, manufacturing techniques, and signal processing, while forecasting their future development trends.

Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfven pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. Using perturbation theory and the solution found for the case of a homogeneous in a cross section magnetic tube, the electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfven wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e. accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined. For the chromospheric footpoints of the magnetic loops, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decay, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.

arXiv:2412.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface research has shown significant potential for controlling the polarization, amplitude, phase and propagation direction of light. Nevertheless, control over the angular response of incident light still remains a long-standing problem. In this work, we show the potential of diffractive systems for obtaining a step function in momentum space where the mirror symmetry of the angular transmittance is broken. By engineering the scattering response of an asymmetric particles in a metagrating, we could obtain such a step function in a passive, reciprocal, and lossless fashion. More specifically, the metagrating performs filtering in the momentum space with an abrupt switching from reflection to transmission for an incident electromagnetic wave with an arbitrary spatial profile. This metagrating may find diverse applications in the context of optical spatial analog computing. Moreover, it paves the way for exploring the capabilities of diffractive systems for gaining full control over the angular response of light using arbitrary momentum transfer functions.

Abstract: The sensitivity of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers to ionospheric disturbances and their constant growth are nowadays resulting in an increased concern of GNSS-users about the impacts of ionospheric disturbances at mid-latitudes. The geomagnetic storm of June 2015 is an example of a rare phenomenon of a spill-over of equatorial plasma bubbles well North from their habitual. We study the occurrence of small- and medium-scale irregularities in the North Atlantic Eastern-Mediterranean mid- and low-latitudinal zone by analysing the behaviour of the amplitude scintillation index S4 and of the rate of total electron content index (ROTI) during such a storm. In addition, large scale perturbations of the ionospheric electron density were studied using ground and space-born instruments, thus characterizing a complex perturbation behaviour over the region mentioned above. The multi-source data allows us to characterize the impact of irregularities of different scales to better understand the ionospheric dynamics and stress the importance of a proper monitoring of the ionosphere in the studied region.

# Equivalent Circuit Modeling and Design of a Reconfigurable Loaded Dogbone Metasurface Element

arXiv:2412.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerating trend of active metasurfaces -- such as those incorporating non-Foster matching, programmable control, or space-time modulation -- adds complexity to the computational electromagnetic (CEM) simulation landscape. In this work, we present an equivalent circuit model (ECM) for a particular periodic array element -- the dogbone element -- that incorporates an arbitrary sub-cell electronic circuit. The ECM is capable of predicting the overall surface impedance with any changes in the circuit's impedance. Three full-wave CEM simulations fully determine the EC, and the scattering parameters computed from the ECM for an embedded circuit, however complex, should be substantially similar to those produced by the full-wave code. With metasurfaces for which it is possible to obtain an ECM by this method, the reflection or transmission behavior of the surface under varying circuit conditions can be computed quickly without need of any further full-wave solutions. After highlighting the importance of fully characterizing parasitics in embedded components, we apply the method to the design of a varactor-based tunable metasurface, which upon fabrication and focused beam measurement demonstrates excellent model-measure agreement.

Abstract: We show that circularly polarized lasers create plasmas with long-lasting ring-shaped weakly relativistic momentum distributions which, in the presence of an ambient magnetic field, are prone to the electron cyclotron maser instability. Theoretical results and particle-in-cell simulations show that current laser technology can effectively induce field ionized tailored distribution functions and probe the electron cyclotron maser in controlled conditions, providing direct experimental evidence to coherent radiation processes driven by ring-shaped or Landau inverted momentum distributions of relevance in extreme astrophysical conditions.

# Constraining the origin of magnetic white dwarfs

## 限制磁性白矮星的起源

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05400

arXiv:2412.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs has been a long standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using the best available data, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarfs forms. Crystallization dynamos, if operative, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.

# Highly Polarized Type III Storm Observed with Parker Solar Probe

## 帕克太阳探测器观测到高度极化的III型风暴

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05464

arXiv:2412.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft observed a large coronal mass ejection (CME) on 5 September 2022, shortly before closest approach during the 13th PSP solar encounter. For several days following the CME, PSP detected a storm of Type III radio bursts. Stokes parameter analysis of the radio emission indicates that the Type III storm was highly circularly polarized. Left hand circularly polarized (LHC) emission dominated at the start of the storm, transitioning to right hand circularly polarized (RHC) emission at the crossing of the heliospheric current sheet on 6 September.
  We analyze the properties of this Type III storm. The drift rate of the Type IIIs indicates a constant beam speed of $\sim$0.1$c$, typical for Type III-producing electron beams. The sense of polarization is consistent with fundamental emission generated primarily in the $O$-mode.
  The stable and well organized post-CME magnetic field neatly separates the LHC- and RHC-dominated intervals of the storm, with minimal overlap between the senses of polarization. The proximity of PSP to the source region, both in radial distance and in heliographic longitude, makes this event an ideal case study to connect in situ plasma measurements with remote observations of radio emission.

# Relativistic Electron Acceleration and the 'Ankle' Spectral Feature in Earth's Magnetotail Reconnection

arXiv:2412.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons are accelerated to high, non-thermal energies during explosive energy-release events in space, such as magnetic reconnection. However, the properties and acceleration mechanisms of relativistic electrons directly associated with reconnection X-line are not well understood. This study utilizes Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) measurements to analyze the flux and spectral features of sub-relativistic to relativistic (~ 80 to 560 keV) electrons during a magnetic reconnection event in Earth's magnetotail. This event provided a unique opportunity to measure the electrons directly energized by X-line as MMS stayed in the separatrix layer, where the magnetic field directly connects to the X-line, for approximately half of the observation period. Our analysis revealed that the fluxes of relativistic electrons were clearly enhanced within the separatrix layer, and the highest flux was directed away from the X-line, which suggested that these electrons originated directly from the X-line. Spectral analysis showed that these relativistic electrons deviated from the main plasma sheet population and exhibited an "ankle" feature similar to that observed in galactic cosmic rays. The contribution of "ankle" electrons to the total electron energy density increased from 0.1% to 1% in the separatrix layer, though the spectral slopes did not exhibit clear variations. Further analysis indicated that while these relativistic electrons originated from the X-line, they experienced a non-negligible degree of scattering during transport. These findings provide clear evidence that magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetotail can efficiently energize relativistic electrons directly at the X-line, providing new insights into the complex processes governing electron dynamics during magnetic reconnection.

# Oxygen Vacancy-Induced Monoclinic Dead Layers in Ferroelectric $Hf_xZr_{1-x}O_2$ With Metal Electrodes

Abstract: In this work, we analyze dead layer comprising non-polar monoclinic (m) phase in $Hf_xZr_{1-x}O_2$ (HZO)-based ferroelectric (FE) material using first principles analysis. We show that with widely used tungsten (W) metal electrode, the spatial distribution of the oxygen vacancy across the cross-section plays a key role in dictating the favorability of m- phase formation at the metal-HfO2 interface. The energetics are also impacted by the polarization direction as well as the depth of oxygen vacancy, i.e., position along the thickness. At the metal - $HfO_2$ interface, when polarization points towards the metal and vacancy forms at trigonally bonded O atomic site, both interfacial relaxation and m- phase formation can lead to dead layers. For vacancies at other oxygen atomic sites and polarization direction, dead layer is formed due to sole interfacial relaxation with polar phase. We also establish the relative favorability of the m-phase dead layer for different Zr concentrations (x=1 and x = 0.5) and metal electrodes. According to our analysis, 50% Zr doped $HfO_2$ exhibits less probability of m-phase dead layer formation compared to pure $HfO_2$. Moreover, with electrodes consisting of noble metal (Pt, Pd, Os, Ru, Rh), m-phase dead layer formation is less likely. Therefore, for these metals, dead layer forms mainly due to the interfacial relaxation with polar phase.

# Determining the acceleration regions of in situ electrons using remote radio and X-ray observations

arXiv:2412.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles in the heliosphere are produced by flaring processes on the Sun or shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. These particles are regularly detected remotely as electromagnetic radiation (X-rays or radio emission), which they generate through various processes, or in situ by spacecraft monitoring the Sun and the heliosphere. We aim to combine remote-sensing and in situ observations of energetic electrons to determine the origin and acceleration mechanism of these particles. Here, we investigate the acceleration location, escape, and propagation directions of electron beams producing radio bursts observed with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), hard X-ray (HXR) emission and, in situ electrons observed at Solar Orbiter (SolO) on 3 October 2023. These observations are combined with a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the electron acceleration locations and results from a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model of the solar corona in order to investigate the origin and connectivity of electrons observed remotely at the Sun to in situ electrons. We observed a type II radio burst with good connectivity to SolO, where a significant electron event was detected. However, type III radio bursts and Hard X-rays were also observed co-temporally with the elctron event but likely connected to SolO by different far-sided field lines. The injection times of the SolO electrons are simultaneous with both the onset of the type II radio burst, the group of type III bursts and the presence of a second HXR peak, however, the most direct connection to SolO is that of the type II burst location. The in situ electron spectra point to shock acceleration of electrons with a short-term connection to the source region.

Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides critical insights into the microstructural and connectional organization of the human brain. However, the availability of high-field, open-access datasets that include raw k-space data for advanced research remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce Diff5T, a first comprehensive 5.0 Tesla diffusion MRI dataset focusing on the human brain. This dataset includes raw k-space data and reconstructed diffusion images, acquired using a variety of imaging protocols. Diff5T is designed to support the development and benchmarking of innovative methods in artifact correction, image reconstruction, image preprocessing, diffusion modelling and tractography. The dataset features a wide range of diffusion parameters, including multiple b-values and gradient directions, allowing extensive research applications in studying human brain microstructure and connectivity. With its emphasis on open accessibility and detailed benchmarks, Diff5T serves as a valuable resource for advancing human brain mapping research using diffusion MRI, fostering reproducibility, and enabling collaboration across the neuroscience and medical imaging communities.

arXiv:2205.06108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming multipetawatt laser facilities are capable of inducing effects of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in laser-plasma interaction such as strong radiation reaction and QED cascades, both of which can significantly influence the properties and dynamics of laser plasma. This can result in the formation of extreme plasma structures with unprecedented TG levels of quasistatic magnetic fields, for example current sheets or pinch configurations of nanometer scale or smaller. In such structures radiation losses can play a significant role, so the influence of radiation losses onto the evolution of extreme current sheets deserves a separate and thorough investigation. In the current work we develop an analytical model and extend the quasiadiabatic approach describing individual particle motion onto 3D particle motion in the case when radiation reaction is non-negligible. Given that particle motion is determined by (quasi)invariants of non-dissipative motion, we derive how these (quasi)invariants evolve under the influence of radiation losses, quantify this influence and obtain a (quasi)invariant of dissipative motion. This allows reducing the dimensionality of the system of differential equations describing particle motion to just two instead of six. It is also discussed how the presented method can be used in a wider range of problems.

arXiv:2403.18070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geomagnetic storms occurring due to sustained, high-speed solar winds are known to induce currents in power distribution networks. These geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can cause high voltage transformers (HVT) to overheat, thus resulting in a catastrophic electricity loss event (CELE). Since significant portions of infrastructures around the world rely heavily on access to electric power, it is essential to estimate the risks associated with GICs on a global scale. We assemble multiple methodologies across various scientific disciplines to develop a framework assessing the probability of a severe geomagnetic storm causing a long-term, widespread power outage. Our model incorporates thermal models of HVT tie bar hot spots, historical geoelectric field estimates, and a global conductivity model to estimate the risk of long-term power outage for regions between -70 degrees and 80 degrees geomagnetic latitude due to transformer overheating failure. Assuming a uniform 33% HVT spare capacity, our analysis indicates that a 1 in 10,000 year storm would result in approximately 1% of the population in Europe and North America experiencing a long-term (months to years) electricity loss.

Abstract: This study presents a cross-verification of fast ion effects on turbulence through a systematic comparison of two leading gyrokinetic codes, GENE [F. Jenko et al., Phys. Plasmas 7 1904-1910 (2000)] and CGYRO [J. Candy et al, J. Comput. Phys. 324 73-93 (2016)], using L-mode plasma profiles from KSTAR for local linear and nonlinear electromagnetic simulations. The focus is on the impact of fast ions and rotation effects on energy flux, aiming to identify the similarities and differences between these codes in the context of turbulence transport research. The analysis shows consistency in linear stability results, fractional changes in energy flux, changes in the distribution of energy fluxes, fluctuations and phase angle with fast ions, and zonal shearing between the codes. However, discrepancies arise in absolute thermal energy levels and rotation effects on energy transport, especially in the presence of fast ions. The study underscores the critical importance of phase angle analysis in gyrokinetic code verification, particularly when assessing fast ion effects on turbulence. Additionally, it highlights the need to examine quantities at lower levels of the primacy hierarchy, as discrepancies at lower levels can lead to divergent results at higher levels. These findings indicate the necessity for further investigation into these discrepancies and the novel phase angle structures observed, contributing to the advancement of accurate transport predictions in fusion plasmas.

Abstract: We report measurements of ten custom-made high-homogeneity LYSO crystals. The investigation is motivated by the need for a compact, high-resolution, and fast electromagnetic calorimeter for a new rare pion decay experiment. Each $2.5\times 2.5 \times 18$ cm$^3$ crystal was first characterized for general light yield properties and then its longitudinal response uniformity and energy resolution were measured using low-energy gamma sources. The ten crystals were assembled as an array and subjected to a 30 - 100 MeV positron beam with excellent momentum definition. The energy and timing resolutions were measured as a function of energy, and the spatial resolution was determined at 70 MeV. An additional measurement using monoenergetic 17.6 MeV gammas produced through a p-Li resonance was later made after the photosensors used in positron testing were improved. As an example of the results, the energy resolution at 70 MeV of 1.52 $\pm$ 0.03% is more than two times better than reported results using previous generation LYSO crystals.

Abstract: In ferrofluids, the vorticity is balanced by the rate of particle rotation, which is known here as critical balance. The universal energy cascade is investigated for a stationary and non-stationary incompressible ferrofluid turbulent system using exact relations. The findings reveal that under moderate magnetic fields, kinetic and total energy cascades occur at identical rates. As the external magnetic field strength increases, the total energy cascade becomes non-stationary and differs from the kinetic one. However, the cascade's universal, scale-independent nature remains unaffected. The suppression of turbulence in ferrofluids is observable at strong magnetic fields.

Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.

arXiv:2207.01636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of magnetohydrodynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of strong magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals new terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for novel diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.

We highlight a subset of such states in which we note an increase in $N(0)$ to suggest the interesting effects of magnetic fluctuations and La substitution on the electronic structure of this material.

Abstract: Color centers in the O-band (1260-1360 nm) are critical for realizing long-coherence quantum network nodes in memory-assisted quantum communications. However, only a limited number of O-band color centers have been explored in silicon hosts as spin-photon interfaces. This study explores and compares two promising O-band defects in silicon: T centers and $^*$Cu (transition metal) color centers. During T center formation, we observed the formation and dissolution of various defects, including the copper-silver-related defect with a doublet line around 1312 nm ($^*$Cu$^{0}_{n}$), near the optical fiber zero dispersion wavelength. We then investigate the photophysics of both T and $^*$Cu centers, focusing on their emission spectra and spin properties to assess their potential for high-fidelity spin-photon interfaces. Additionally, we report a 25\% broadening of the $^*$Cu$^{0}_{0}$ line under a 0.5 T magnetic field, potentially linked to spin degeneracy, suggesting that this defect may provide a promising alternative to T centers for spin-photon interfaces.

arXiv:2401.01336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by explosive releases of energy in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas, we consider the nonlinear stability of stratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria against two-dimensional interchanges of straight magnetic-flux tubes. We demonstrate that, even within this restricted class of dynamics, the linear stability of an equilibrium does not guarantee its nonlinear stability: equilibria can be metastable. We show that the minimum-energy state accessible to a metastable equilibrium under non-diffusive 2D dynamics can be found by solving a combinatorial optimisation problem. These minimum-energy states are, to good approximation, the final states reached by our simulations of destabilised metastable equilibria for which turbulent mixing is suppressed by viscosity. To predict the result of fully turbulent relaxation, we construct a statistical mechanical theory based on the maximisation of Boltzmann's mixing entropy. This theory is analogous to the Lynden-Bell statistical mechanics of collisionless stellar systems and plasma, and to the Robert-Sommeria-Miller (RSM) theory of 2D vortex turbulence. Our theory reproduces well the results of our numerical simulations for sufficiently large perturbations to the metastable equilibrium.

The present work reports the synthesis, structure, and magnetic properties of a one-dimensional coordination polymer made of copper(II) chloride and 1,2,4- triazole. The coordination polymer is synthesized in hydrochloric acid at room temperature. The structure determination by single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals an array of copper atoms bridged via two chlorine and a triazole.  Magnetisation data show no hysteresis at temperatures down to 2 K, but suggest antisymmetric exchange and antiferromagnetic coupling between the neighbouring spins of Cu(II) ions.  This work gives impetus for the synthesis of large crystals of coordination polymers based on which magnetic properties can be studied in depth.

Mycobacterial hemerythrin-like proteins (HLPs) are important for the survival of pathogens in macrophages. Their molecular mechanisms of function remain poorly defined but recent studies point to their possible role in nitric oxide (NO) scavenging. Unlike any nonheme diiron protein studied so far, the diferric HLP from Mycobacterium kansasii (Mka-HLP) reacts with NO in a multistep fashion to consume four NO molecules per diiron center. HLPs are largely conserved across mycobacteria and we argued that comparative studies of distant orthologs may illuminate the role of the protein scaffold in this reactivity and yield intermediates with properties more favorable for detailed spectroscopic characterization. Herein, we show that HLP from Azotobacter vinelandii (Avi-HLP) requires a single T47F point mutation in the outer sphere of its diferric center to adopt a bridging mu-oxo diferric structure alike that of Mka-HLP that makes it reactive toward NO. Radical combination of NO with the mu-oxo bridge yields nitrite and a mixed valent Fe(III)Fe(II) cluster that further react with NO to produce a stable magnetically coupled Fe(III){FeNO}7 cluster. We report characterization of this stable cluster by electronic absorption, EPR, FTIR and resonance Raman spectroscopies and suggest ways Phe 46 (Mka numbering) might control the Fe(III) reduction potential and the NO reactivity of HLPs.

Altermagnets have been recently introduced as a classification of collinear, spin compensated magnetic materials that host net-zero magnetization, yet display some electronic behaviors typically associated with non-compensated magnetic materials like ferromagnets. The emergence of such properties are a consequence of spin-split bands that arise under specific symmetry conditions in the limit of zero spin–orbit coupling. In this Perspective, we summarize the fundamental criteria for realizing an altermagnetic phase and present a qualitative electronic band structure derivation and symmetry analysis through chemical principles. We then discuss the properties that make altermagnets distinctive candidates for charge-to-spin conversion elements in spintronic devices, and provide a brief review of some altermagnetic candidate materials. Finally, we discuss future directions for altermagnetism and highlight opportunities for chemists to advance this emerging field.

# Prediction of antipsychotic drug efficacy for schizophrenia treatment based on neural features of the resting-state functional connectome

## 基于静息态功能连接组神经特征预测抗精神病药物治疗精神分裂症的疗效

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5368102/latest

Neuroimaging studies have identified a large number of biomarkers associated with schizophrenia (SZ), but there is still a lack of biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of antipsychotic medication in SZ patients. The aim of this study was to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of antipsychotic drug response among features of the resting-state connectome. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance scans were acquired from a discovery cohort of 105 patients with SZ at baseline and after 8 weeks of antipsychotic medication treatment. Baseline clinical status and post-treatment outcome were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and clinical improvement was rated by the total score reduction. Based on acquired imaging data, a resting-state functional connectivity matrix was constructed for each patient, and a connectome-based predictive model was subsequently established and trained to predict individual PANSS total score reduction. Model performance was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and true score reduction with leave-one-out cross-validation. Finally, the generalizability of the model was tested using an independent validation cohort of 52 SZ patients. The model incorporating resting-state connectome characteristics predicted individual treatment outcomes in both the discovery cohort (prediction vs. truth r&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.59, mean squared error (MSE)&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.021) and validation cohort (r&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.41, MSE&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.036). The model identified four positive features and eight negative features, which were respectively correlated positively and negatively with PANSS total score reduction. Among these positive features, the specific connections within the parietal lobe played a crucial role in the model's predictive performance. As for the negative features, they included the frontoparietal control network and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical connections. This study discovered and validated a set of functional features based on resting-state connectome, where higher connectivity of positive features and lower connectivity of negative features at baseline were associated with a higher reduction rate of PANSS total score in patients and a better therapeutic effect. These functional features can be used to predict the PANSS total score reduction rate of SZ patients through a model. Clinical doctors can potentially infer the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication treatment for patients based on the predicted results.
