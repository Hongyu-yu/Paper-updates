Author(s): M. I. Bakunov, A. V. Shirokova, M. A. Kurnikov, and A. V. Maslov<br /><p>This paper critically examines the theoretical models used in the study of photonic time crystals, emphasizing the importance of taking dynamics of the medium, such as polarization, into account. The findings challenge earlier predictions of parametric amplification in a Lorentzian medium, showing that such effects do not arise when the medium’s full dynamics are properly accounted for.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRA/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevA.110.063532.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

# Real-world effectiveness of a single-day regimen for transcranial magnetic stimulation using Optimized, Neuroplastogen-Enhanced techniques in Depression (ONE-D)

## 在抑郁症中使用优化的神经浆原增强技术进行经颅磁刺激的单日方案的真实效果 (一维)

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5679327/latest

Background: Conventional transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) regimens are logistically burdensome, requiring days or weeks of clinic visits. Here we describe a TMS regimen enabling delivery of an entire therapeutic course in a single day.
Methods: This retrospective case series reports outcomes for an optimized, neuroplastogen-enhanced depression (ONE-D) treatment regimen delivering 600-pulse iTBS (120% MT) targeting left DLPFC via scalp heuristic, every 30 minutes for 20 sessions in 9.5 hours, enhancing neuroplasticity via single-dose d-cycloserine (125 mg) and lisdexamfetamine (20 mg), off-label, given 1 hour pre-treatment. 32 TMS-eligible adults with medication-resistant unipolar depression underwent the ONE-D regimen, with assessments on day-of-treatment then weekly x 6 weeks (HDRS-17, BDI-II, PHQ-9, and GAD-7).
Results: Every patient completed the regimen successfully, with no serious adverse events (mean scalp discomfort, 5.8&plusmn;2.1/10). Response was not immediate but followed an exponential-decay trajectory over the 6-week followup: mean weekly scores of 22.6&plusmn;5.3(baseline), 13.5&plusmn;6.4, 10.6&plusmn;6.4, 7.9&plusmn;4.9, 6.6&plusmn;4.9, 6.3&plusmn;4.8, 5.5&plusmn;4.2 (HDRS-17), 37.5&plusmn;9.0(baseline), 23.8&plusmn;12.2, 17.1&plusmn;11.1, 14.1&plusmn;11.2, 11.0&plusmn;8.7, 9.5&plusmn;8.2, 7.6&plusmn;7.8 (BDI-II,) 18.4&plusmn;3.5(baseline), 11.4&plusmn;5.1, 9.4&plusmn;5.7, 6.9&plusmn;5.2, 6.0&plusmn;3.9, 5.3&plusmn;4.0, 4.6&plusmn;4.2 (PHQ-9), 14.3&plusmn;5.2(baseline), 8.7&plusmn;4.5, 6.4&plusmn;5.0, 4.3&plusmn;4.0, 3.8&plusmn;3.6, 3.3&plusmn;3.3, 3.1&plusmn;2.7 (GAD-7). Response / remission rates (cross-sectional, not aggregated) were 90.3% and 74.2% (HDRS-17), 93.5% and 71.0% (BDI-II), 90.3% and 58.1% (PHQ-9), 93.3% and 76.7% (GAD-7) at week 6, and 92.6% and 77.8% (HDRS-17), 92.3% and 73.1% (BDI-II), 86.4% and 65.4% (PHQ-9), 91.7% and 80.0% (GAD-7) at week 12.
Conclusion: Delivery of an effective TMS course in one day appears feasible, safe, and well-tolerated. With neuroplastogen-enhancement, despite non-personalized, scalp-based targeting, the response and remission rates appeared robust and sustained in representative clinical populations. Follow-up studies may allow further acceleration of the regimen and generalization to other TMS indications.
