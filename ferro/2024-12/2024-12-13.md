Author(s): Zeeshawn Kazi, Isaac M. Shelby, Ruhee Nirodi, Joseph Turnbull, Hideyuki Watanabe, Kohei M. Itoh, Paul A. Wiggins, and Kai-Mei C. Fu<br /><p>DNA flexibility is a key determinant of biological function, but the inability to directly measure the bending energy at short, biophysically relevant length scales leaves this quantity poorly understood. The authors measure DNA bending directly, by tethering a ferromagnetic nanoparticle probe to an individual DNA molecule, applying a magnetic field, and reading out a diamond magnetic field sensor. Wide-field imaging of quantum defects near the surface of the diamond enables measurement of the DNA bending torque.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRAPPLIED/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.22.064044.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

# Anticancer properties of copolymer nanoparticles loaded with Feoniculum vulgare derivatives in Hs578T and SUM159 cancer cell lines

## 载有小茴香衍生物的共聚物纳米颗粒在Hs578T和SUM159癌细胞系中的抗癌特性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5181263/latest

Background In recent years, the rising occurrence of cancer, particularly breast cancer, has led to a growing interest in utilizing nanotechnology for treatment. As a result of the significant side effects of chemical drugs, researchers have explored the potential of plants with antioxidant properties as an alternative option. Feoniculum vulgare, one of the potent plants for cancer therapy, is rich of anti-cancer compounds found in its essential oil and ethanolic extract.Methods This study was conducted to investigate the anti-tumor properties of F. vulgare, along with the application of copolymers for their targeted delivery to Hs578T and SUM159 cancer cells. First, the ethanolic extract from aerial parts and calluses of F. vulgare and essential oil extraction were produced. Second, polymer nanoparticles composed of PLA-Chitosan were synthesized, and their characteristics were investigated using various techniques such as Hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis. After preparation of PLA-PEG-HA/PLA-Chitosan nanoparticles, the physicochemical properties of these nanoparticles including their size, zeta potential, morphology, size distribution, and magnetic features were evaluated. The encapsulation efficiency of copolymers with F. vulgare ethanolic extract, essential oil, Anethole, and pure quercetin was analyzed. After that the drug release kinetics (at pH&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;5 and 7.4), in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation, and analysis of cell apoptosis to evaluate the efficacy of drug delivery to Hs578T and SUM159 triple-negative breast cancer cell lines were evaluated.Results The results of the study indicated that PLA-PEG-HA/PLA-Chitosan nanoparticles possess a spherical shape with an average size of 240 nm and a zeta potential of -10.8 mV. Moreover, the drug release pattern illustrated a higher release rate from synthesized nanoparticles under acidic conditions (pH&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;5). The WST-1 assay revealed the biocompatibility of the drug-free nanocarriers and their minimal toxicity. Additionally, the Hs578T cell line treated with PLA-PEG-HA/Chitosan-PLA/Quercetin nanoparticles exhibited the highest percentages of pre- and post-apoptotic cells (34.06% and 8.19%, respectively).Conclusions The PLA-Chitosan and PLA-PEG-HA/Chitosan-PLA copolymer nanoparticles exhibit a noteworthy capacity for the targeted delivery of Quercetin, Anethole, and other anti-cancer compounds present in the ethanolic extract and essential oil of F. vulgare towards cancerous cells.

# A galactic cosmic ray cavity in Earth-Moon space

## 地球-月球空间中的银河宇宙射线腔

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5447254/latest

In regions of the solar system distant from planetary magnetic fields, galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) have generally been assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout interplanetary space. However, our analysis of data from the Chang&amp;rsquo;E-4 lander revealed a region of reduced GCR flux in the pre-noon sector of the lunar orbit. Further investigation suggests the presence of an energetic particle cavity, formed by the Earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field acting as an obstacle to GCR propagation. This cavity indicates that the influence of Earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field within the space environment extends unexpectedly up to and far beyond lunar orbit. This discovery offers the potential to avoid high radiation levels during future lunar exploration and deep-space missions.

# Single-Step Thermo-Mechano-Chemical Approach for Advance Magnet Manufacturing

## 用于先进磁体制造的单步热机械化学方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5545269/latest

Demand for strong permanent magnets has been rising due to their diverse and unique applications. Traditionally, these magnets are produced through powder metallurgy, but their inherent brittleness limits manufacturing yields. Herein, an alternative single-step method for mechano-chemical sintering of brittle Sm-Co magnetic powders through Friction Stir Consolidation (FSC) - resulting in a combination of mechano-chemo-thermal stimuli, is reported. Open-air FSC of commercially obtained SmCo5 (containing Sm2Co7) led to oxidation of Sm2Co7 into nano-crystalline SmCo(5-x) (where x &amp;lt; 1) precipitates and Sm2O3 phases. Heat generated due to the redox reaction and adiabatic heating abets compaction. Degree of phase transition during FSC was dependent on dwell time, with longer times facilitating transformation of Sm2Co7 into SmCo(5-x) and improving saturation magnetization. This study demonstrates that a low-temperature, shear-assisted deformation and consolidation process can effectively consolidate brittle powders like SmCo5 with concomitant reduction in total Sm2Co7 contaminant. Our method leads to enhancement of desired magnetic properties in Sm-Co magnets by controlling the initial powder mix and processing conditions (i.e., atmosphere and process parameters) during FSC.

# Enhanced Recovery of Tantalum and Niobium from Fine-Grained Low-Grade Abu Dabbab Tantalite Ore via Falcon Concentration and Magnetic Separation

## 通过Falcon浓缩和磁选从细粒低品位Abu Dabbab钽矿石中提高钽和铌的回收率

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5361849/latest

Tantalum and niobium possess unique properties that make them invaluable across various industries. However, their similar chemical characteristics and natural co-occurrence challenge their separation. This study investigates the recovery of tantalum and niobium from low-grade Abu Dabbab tantalite ore using gravity and magnetic separation techniques. Tantalite ore consists mainly of silicate minerals, with traces of tantalumand niobium oxides. The beneficiation process,of the size fraction &amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;75 micron,began with gravity separation using Falcon concentrator, which achieved an optimal tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) grade of 2.0% and recovery of 85.70%. Optimization of process parameters was carried out using the Box-Behnken design. Magnetic separation with a Box-Mag Rapid LHW magnetic separator was applied to further enrich the tantalum concentrate, achieving a Ta2O5 grade of 6.22% and a recovery rate of 94.73%. This process also yielded significant enrichment of niobium oxide (Nb2O5) and cassiterite (SnO2), with enrichment ratios of 250-fold for both Ta2O5 and Nb2O5and 195-fold for SnO2. Additionally, the beneficiation process recovered valuable albite and mica fractions. The characterization of the final tantalum concentrate revealed high Ta₂O₅, Nb₂O₅, and SnO₂ content, confirming that combined Falcon and magnetic separation effectively enhances recovery and enrichment of tantalum and niobium from complex ores.

# Therapeutic Hypothermia in Preterm Infants Under 36 Weeks: Outcomes and Brain MRI Findings

## 36周以下早产儿的治疗性低温: 结果和脑部MRI表现

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5412003/latest

Purpose: Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a significant cause of neonatal brain injury. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the standard treatment for term neonates, but its safety and efficacy in neonates &amp;lt;36 weeks&rsquo; gestational age (GA) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of preterm infants with HIE treated with TH.&amp;nbsp;
Methods: Retrospective analysis of preterm infants (&amp;lt;36w&rsquo;GA) treated with TH (01/2019-06/2024). Data on demographics, clinical complications, coagulation profiles, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neurodevelopment outcomes were analyzed.&amp;nbsp;
Results: Seventeen patients were included (median GA 34.4w; median birth weight 2300g), 58.8% were male. Placental abruption was identified in 7 cases (41.2%), and 8 (47.1%) required advanced resuscitation. Thirteen patients (76.5%) presented anemia, 12 (70.6%) coagulopathy, 9 (52.9%) thrombocytopenia, and 9 (52.9%) acute liver failure. Hypofibrinogenemia (&amp;lt;1g/L) was significantly associated with severe intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and mortality unrelated to withdrawal of care. MRI findings were classified based on the predominant lesion: I-hypoxic-ischemic injury, II-severe ICH, or III-normal/mild findings. Severe ICH was the predominant lesion in 4 cases (23.5%). White matter injury was seen in 12 (76%). Death occurred in 8 cases (47.1%), with 3 (37.5%) resulting from withdrawal of care and 5 (62.5%) from fatal complications. Of the 9 surviving patients, at 2 years, 6 (66.7%) had normal neurodevelopment, while 1 (11.1%) had severe disability.&amp;nbsp;
Conclusion: Coagulation abnormalities, particularly hypofibrinogenemia, significantly increase the risk of severe ICH and mortality in &amp;lt;36w infants treated with TH. The safety and efficacy of TH in this population require further investigation.

# The cylindrical devices with tunable positive, infinite, and negative capacitance for dynamic random access memory

## 用于动态随机存取存储器的具有可调正，无限和负电容的圆柱形器件

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5463376/latest

The capacitance behavior of the ultra-thin ferroelectric/dielectric (FE/DE) stacked devices in the nanoscale cylindrical structure deviated from the negative capacitance (NC) state to unpredicted other states. This work confirmed that the ultra-thin (2.0&ndash;3.0 nm) FE Hf0.33Zr0.67O2 layer could have a positive capacitance, infinite capacitance, or NC by controlling the thickness of the stacked DE Al2O3 layer thickness (1.0&ndash;3.0 nm). Detailed analytical model and numerical simulation based on phase-field modeling, considering the FE polarization bound charge compensation by the injected/trapped interfacial carriers and the geometry effect of the cylinder, precisely identified the change of the inhomogeneous stray field energy, which played a crucial role in determining the capacitance state. Further analysis of the models revealed that the capacitance variation is strongly correlated to the extent of the initial polarization charge compensation of the ferroelectric domains. This work provides guidelines for developing the next-generation capacitors in dynamic random access memory.
