# Chaotropic or Hydrophobic Effect: Distinct binding signatures of nano-ions to a non-ionic polymer

## 离液或疏水效应: 纳米离子与非离子聚合物的不同结合特征

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hkjpk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Martin, Dulle

The nanometric ions (nano-ions) SiW12O404- (SiW) and B(C6H5)4- (BPh4) are considered as a superchaotropic and a hydro-phobic ion, respectively, in extension to the chaotropic side of the Hofmeister series. A distinction between chaotropic, superchaotropic and hydrophobic ions, however, has not been presented so far. Herein, we show by measurement of the viscosity B-coefficient of SiW (and other nano-ions) and of ion binding to the non-ionic polymer hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), how chaotropic, superchaotropic and hydrophobic ions can be unambiguously distinguished. The viscosity B-coefficient of the superchaotropic SiW is positive as for hydrophobic ions, and distinct from classical chaotropic ions with a negative B-coefficient. In HPC-solution, BPh4 and SiW bind to the polymer, dramatically increasing the viscosity and the cloud point. Heating induces characteristically distinct responses for the two nano-ions: The viscosity rises for BPh4 and decreases for SiW. These effects are related to nano-ion induced aggregation and electric charging of HPC, which, upon heating, become stronger for BPh4 and weaker for SiW as shown by Small Angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry showed that the structural effects are linked to binding thermodynamics. Upon heating, the binding constant decreases for SiW and increases for BPh4 arising respectively from an enthalpically favorable, exothermic, chaotropic driving force or an enthalpically unfavorable, endothermic, hydropho-bic driving force. Combining the viscosity B-coefficient and sign of the binding enthalpy enables distinguishing cha-otropic, superchaotropic and hydrophobic ions. Importantly, superchaotropic binding can be stronger or weaker than hydrophobic binding depending on the temperature. Ion hydration and binding are demonstrated as powerful tools to tune polymer solution properties.

Herein we report the use of the methanide ligand {CH(SiMe3)P(Ph)2=NSiMe3}– (NPC-H) in the stabilization of alkaline earth and rare earth complexes. Protonolysis of the proligand with nBu2Mg or dibenzyl precursors [M(CH2Ph)2(THF)x] (M = Ca–Ba, Eu, Yb) afforded bis-methanide complexes [M(NPC-H)2(THF)x] (1-M·(THF)x; M = Mg, Eu, Yb, x = 0; M = Ca, x = 0, 1; M = Sr, x = 0, 2; M = Ba, x = 2). The same reaction protocol with SmⅡ afforded oxidation product [Sm(NPC-H)3] (2-Sm) reproducibly, which could also be obtained via salt metathesis reaction between [{K(NPC-H)}2] and SmI3(THF)3.5. This salt metathesis methodology was also extended to [REI3(THF)x] (RE = Y, La, Pr), affording tris-methanides, [RE(NPC-H)3] (2-RE; RE = Y, La, Pr). 1-M and 2-RE were characterized by multinuclear NMR, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction; additionally, reactivity of 1-Yb, 2-Y and 2-La as potential synthetic precursors was probed with HN(SiMe3)2 and HOC6H3tBu2-2,6. NMR studies of the 1-M family reveal some underlying changes in the M–C bond character and bonding parameters in the ligand. We also report the first 171Yb{1H} NMR chemical shift (1046.5 ppm) of an ytterbium complex with an iminophosphoranomethanide ligand. Finally, the electronic structure of 1-Eu was studied by means of electron paramagnetic resonance and ab initio calculations.

# Relaxation optimized heteronuclear experiments for extending the size limit of RNA nuclear magnetic resonance

**Authors:** Michael, Summers

The application of NMR to large RNAs has been limited by the inability to perform heteronuclear correlation experiments essential for resolving overlapping 1H NMR signals, determining inter-proton distance restraints and inter-helical orientations for structure calcula-tions, and evaluating conformational dynamics. Approaches exploiting 1H-13C correlations that are routinely applied to proteins and small RNAs of ~60 nucleotides or fewer are impractical for larger RNAs due to rapid dipolar relaxation of protons by their attached car-bons. Here we report a 2H-enhanced, 1H-15N correlation approach that enables atom-specific NMR characterization of much larger RNAs. Purine H8 transverse relaxation rates are reduced ~20-fold with ribose perdeuteration, enabling efficient magnetization transfer via two-bond 1H-15N couplings. We focus on H8-N9 correlation spectra which benefit from favorable N9 chemical shift anisotropy. Chemical shift assignment is enabled by retention of protons at the C1′ position, which allow measurement of two-bond H1′-N9 and through-space H1′-H8 correlations with only a minor effect on H8 relaxation. The approach is demonstrated for the 232 nucleotide HIV-1 Rev response element, where chemical shift assignments, 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effects, and 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings are readily obtained from sensitive, high-resolution spectra. Heteronuclear correlated NMR methods that have been essential for the study of proteins can now be extended to RNAs of at least 78 kDa.

**Authors:** Christel, Laberty-Robert

Despite intriguing optical, magnetic, and redox properties, inorganic materials containing pentavalent manganese (Mn5+) are rare and could never be designed as shape-controlled crystals, which limits the ability to tune properties. Herein, we explore alkali hydroxide mixtures with controlled water content, namely hydrofluxes, to demonstrate phase, shape, and nanostructure control of Mn(V) oxides. We demonstrate speciation among KSrMnVO4, Sr5(MnVO4)3OH, and SrMnIVO3 with the water content, the strontium content, and the nature of the alkali cation of the hydroxide salt. We then provide evidence of the key role of water in enabling shape and nanostructure control, which we relate to the preferential interaction of water with specific crystal facets of the hydroxyapatite Sr5(MnVO4)3OH, and to the impact of water on precursor solubility in water-poor hydrofluxes. We then show that nanostructured Mn(V) hydroxyapatite possesses an acid-base redox stability window enabling electrochemical operation in strongly oxidative conditions. By correlating fundamental knowledge of hydrofluxes with crystallization mechanisms, this work sheds light on the possibilities offered by hydrofluxes for crystal shape, size and property control.

# Realization of a photoelectrochemical cascade for the generation of methanol, a liquid solar fuel

## 实现光电化学级联以产生液态太阳能燃料甲醇

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-kxf6j-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Joel W., Ager

Biochemical networks use reaction cascades to selectively reduce CO2 using energy from sunlight, but can similar selectivity be achieved by applying a cascade approach to an engineered system? Here, we report the design and implementation of a two-step photoelectrochemical (PEC) cascade to a liquid solar fuel: reduction of CO2 to CO and subsequent reduction of CO to methanol. The potentials required to perform the reductions were generated using custom-made III-V-based three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cells. Cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNT) catalyzed both reactions. Multiphysics simulations of electrolyte flow and non-illuminated electrochemical measurements were used to narrow the operating parameters for the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes. The champion integrated photocathode produced methanol with 3.8 ± 0.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE), with tested photocathodes having 0.7-3.8% methanol FE. Products were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The current output of the tested photocathodes was highly stable, and methanol production continued over multiple experiments. The low methanol yield is attributed to insufficient CO flux to, and CO2 depletion at, the methanol-producing subcell when both contacts are active, which is supported by the observation that a control photoelectrode slightly outperformed the methanol production of the 3TT device. Methanol production ceased when the 3TT subcell driving CO reduction was deactivated, supporting the assignment of a cascade mechanism. The major factors resulting in low methanol FE by the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes are insufficient CO2 depletion at the methanol-producing contact and uncertainty in operating potential selection using the 3TT design. Although the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathode is not yet highly selective, this work develops the basic science principles underlying the PEC cascade, demonstrates the co-design of a 3TT-based photoelectrode to produce carbon-based fuels, and finally discusses routes for improving product yields with this concept, including CO2 supply optimization and alternative photoelectrode and catalyst materials.

# The relaxation behaviors and competing aging mechanisms of GAP-based propellant during the aging process

## GAP基推进剂老化过程中的松弛行为及竞争老化机制

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5437468/latest

The glycidyl azide polymer(GAP)-based propellant, as a category of composite propellant with higher energy efficiency, exhibits a distinct nonlinear change in viscoelastic behaviours during the aging, which differs from the single change trend behaviours of other traditional propellants. This study investigates the relaxation behaviours of solid propellants under thermal aging conditions at 60&amp;deg;C. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and high-performance liquid chromatography tests are used to reveal the aging mechanisms for the nonlinear variation in the relaxation curves of GAP-based propellants. The aging process of GAP-based propellants can be divided into three stages. In the first stage, the propellants are primarily influenced by post-curing reactions. Subsequently, the aging process is affected by both the scission of the crosslinking network and the degradation reactions of the plasticizer. These two mechanisms operate a competitive effect on relaxation, due to their alterations of the propellant's free volume microscopically. In addition, this work presents a predictive model for the relaxation modulus based on the established aging mechanisms, indicating the nonlinear fluctuations of the aging shift factor. The model effectively predicts the variations in the relaxation modulus during the thermal aging process of GAP-based propellants.

# The VOSTARS Wearable AR Platform vs. Traditional IR Navigation: a comparative Study on Neuronavigation Accuracy

## VOSTARS可穿戴AR平台与传统红外导航: 神经导航精度的比较研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5320112/latest

Neuronavigation is integral to modern neurosurgery. Clinical studies demonstrate its effectiveness. The primary tracking modalities in neurosurgical navigation are optical tracking systems (OTS) and electromagnetic tracking systems (EMTS). OTS remains the gold standard due to its accuracy and reliability. However, inherent inaccuracies due to brain deformation and image resolution and tool calibration and registration errors can impact overall accuracy significantly, which differs from the system-declared accuracy. Augmented reality (AR) technologies solve traditional navigation challenges by integrating virtual information with the patient&rsquo;s anatomy, enhancing the surgeon&rsquo;s focus and cognitive load management. Head-mounted displays (HMDs) offer ergonomic benefits, although most AR-based neuronavigation studies have been limited to proof-of-concept trials. This study aims to evaluate VOSTARS, a novel hybrid video and optical see-through HMD designed for precision surgery, specifically in neurosurgical oncology for targeting supratentorial tumors. Previous in-vitro studies using patient-specific phantoms have shown promising results, with high accuracy in real-to-virtual target visualization and craniotomy trajectory tracing. With this work, we further assessed VOSTARS&rsquo; targeting accuracy within a realistic neurosurgery clinical workflow and compared its performance to the commercial StealthStation &reg; system on a patient-specific phantom. Our results demonstrate that users achieved the same median accuracy, 2 mm (IQR: 1 mm), over 60 measurements with both VOSTARS and the StealthStation &reg; with no statistically significant difference between the systems, confirming the non-inferiority of the VOSTARS platform compared to a commercial optical tracking-based surgical navigator.

## 胎盘错位患者剖宫产术中大出血的MRI表现比较: 子宫下段部分胎盘容积是准确客观的指标

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5021930/latest

Purpose
To comprehensively compare the diagnostic ability and inter-reader agreement of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings for predicting massive hemorrhage after cesarean section in patients with placental malposition, aiming to identify the most reliable and objective indicators.
Methods
Totally, 148 consecutive patients with placental malposition underwent MRI and cesarean section at our hospital between January 2014 and July 2021. The patients were divided into massive and non-massive hemorrhage groups. MRI findings of placenta accreta, placental position, and placental volume were evaluated by two radiologists, and inter-reader agreement was calculated. Diagnostic ability for predicting massive hemorrhage was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis.
Results&amp;nbsp;
Intraplacental T2 dark bands (100% vs.&amp;nbsp;58.2%, p = 0.001), placental bulge (50% vs. 3.7%, p &amp;lt; 0.001), loss of retroplacental T2 hypointense line (100% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.01), myometrial thinning (92.9% vs. 57.5%, p = 0.009), total placenta previa (64.3% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.033), and anterior placenta (35.7% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.02) were significantly observed in massive hemorrhage group. Partial placental volume of lower uterine segment (PVpartial) was larger in massive hemorrhage group (166 [108&ndash;214] cm3 vs. 70 [43&ndash;112] cm3 p &amp;lt; 0.001), had the second highest intraclass correlation coefficient (0.84), and had the highest area under the curve (0.81) for diagnosing massive hemorrhage.
Conclusion
This study revealed PVpartial is an accurate and objective indicator for massive hemorrhage, independent of radiologists&rsquo; experience. This indicator potentially enables prediction of massive hemorrhage, improving pre-operative planning in high-risk pregnancies.

# Magnetic Magnetite/Epoxy Nanocomposites with Polyaniline as Coupling Agent: Preparation, Characterization and Property

## 聚苯胺为偶联剂的磁性磁铁矿/环氧树脂纳米复合材料的制备、表征及性能

An in-situ polymerization method fabricated the electrically conductive magnetic epoxy nanocomposites with polyaniline@magnetite. With the introduction of polyaniline on the magnetite nanoparticles, the structural integrity of the synthesized epoxy nanocomposites was enhanced with the bridging effect of the polyaniline. Specifically, compared with pure epoxy, the tensile strength was improved to 82.2 MPa when 1.0 wt% polyaniline@magnetite was added to the epoxy matrix. The enhanced mechanical property is due to the enhanced interfacial interaction. With further increasing particle loading to 30.0 wt%, glass transition temperature (Tg) was decreased to 85.4 oC, which is related to the enlarged free volume between epoxy chains. The saturation magnetization of 30.0 wt% polyaniline@magnetite-epoxy composites was 12.79 emu/g. Moreover, with the assistance of polyaniline@magnetite, the thermal stability was enhanced compared with pure epoxy. The electromagnetic wave absorption of the unique polyaniline@magnetite/epoxy nanocomposites was also studied. When the content of polyaniline@magnetite reached 30.0 wt%, the reflection loss even reached 35.9 dB. This work guides the fabrication of multifunctional epoxy nanocomposites with comprehensive electrical, magnetic and mechanical properties.

# Graphene quantum dot-coated polystyrene microsphere multilayer colloidal crystals with distributed Bragg reflector absorption

## 具有分布布拉格反射吸收的石墨烯量子点涂覆聚苯乙烯微球多层胶体晶体

Distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) absorptive materials have broad application prospects in lasers, optical fibre communications , LEDs, solar cells, and optoelectronic devices. This study used dispersion polymerization to prepare monodisperse polystyrene (PS) microspheres of different particle sizes. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) dispersion was prepared using the ultrasonic dispersion method, and GQDs were self-assembled on the surface of modified PS spheres to form PS@GQDs mi-crospheres. By precise titration and surface tension uniform gravity sedimentation, the volume ratio (GQDs:PS) and thickness of GQDs colloidal crystals were controlled. The results showed that the potential modification of the PS surface significantly red-shifted the near-infrared characteristic peak of PS@GQDs colloidal crystals. The interference fringes of GQDs of various sizes with PS microspheres formed Bragg reflectors, creating longer wavelength intervals and larger resonance amplitudes below 1200 nm. The regulation of the photonic bandgap and the quantum confinement effect of GQDs showed a clear dependency. The lattice constant significantly influenced the near-infrared optical properties of colloidal crystals. Colloidal crystals exhibited different sensitivities to internal structural defects and orderliness across various spectral ranges. Raman studies indicated that increased GQD concentration formed magic-angle graphene, and increased thickness enhanced local electromagnetic field effects, multiple scattering effects, and optical gain. Therefore, this study provides a method to achieve tunable near-infrared shielding or optical absorption materials by adjusting the concentration of GQDs, the particle size of PS@GQDs microspheres, and the thickness of colloidal crystals, which can be applied to distributed Bragg reflector absorptive devices.

# Multi-physics coupled Simulation of the Thermal-pressure Characteristics of Hybrid TIG-MIG Arc

## Tig-mig混合电弧热压特性的多物理场耦合模拟

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5424091/latest

A multi-physics coupled numerical model for the hybrid tungsten inert gas (TIG)-metal inert gas (MIG) arc (HTM arc) was established to investigate the arc behaviors in a simplified case without considering the droplet. The distribution of current density, temperature, electromagnetic force, velocity and pressure were analyzed in detail. The results indicated that a direct current path was established between the welding wire and the tungsten electrode, resulting in the merging of the original MIG and TIG arcs, which coupled to form the hybrid HTM arc. The electromagnetic repulsion force generated by the reverse current caused the original arcs to deflect along the welding direction, and the shape of the HTM arc was bimodal distribution. Compared with traditional single arc, the thermal influence range of the HTM arc on the workpiece surface expanded both along and perpendicular to the welding direction, reducing the temperature gradient and the cooling rate of molten metal behind the arc, which was beneficial to filling the weld toe. As the TIG current increased, the potential difference between the welding wire and tungsten electrode increased, which led to an augmentation in the current flux between them. This, in turn, diminished the electromagnetic force, thereby reducing the plasma velocity and weakening the arc pressure acting on the molten pool. The above thermal-pressure characteristics of HTM arc were beneficial to suppressing the occurrence of undercut and humping defects in high-speed welding, achieving high-quality and high-efficiency welding.

# Crystal direction selection by ferroelastic writing

## 通过铁弹性写入选择晶体方向

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5587758/latest

Crystals often have complex structural domains, lacking a general method to remove or deterministically control such local heterogeneity. The resulting heterogeneity in crystal orientations obscures our understanding of material properties and could reduce the reliability and performance of related applications. Here, using mechanical stress from an atomic force microscope tip, we demonstrate ferroelastic writing for deterministic and reversible control of local crystal orientations. By applying this to various oxide thin films, we realize twin-free single crystals and design specific crystal-orientation domain textures at the nanoscale. Furthermore, through magnetoelastic coupling, this approach could mechanically write and erase functional nanoscale magnetic textures unattainable by conventional methods. Thus, pure mechanical force emerges as a versatile means to control structural heterogeneity on demand and to program electronic and spintronic functionalities.

# Effect of deltoid&ndash;trapezius overlap repair on acromioclavicular joint stability: A biomechanical study using fresh-frozen cadavers

## 三角肌-斜方肌重叠修复对肩锁关节稳定性的影响: 使用新鲜冷冻尸体的生物力学研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5459519/latest

Background: Severe acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation is associated with damage to the deltoid and trapezius muscles. However, studies on the role of these muscles in AC joint stability are limited. To evaluate AC joint stability achieved by deltoid&ndash;trapezius overlap repair (DTOR) and compare it with that provided by the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament. We hypothesized that DTOR would improve the vertical and horizontal stability of the AC joint.
Methods: This study was conducted using six fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders from three male and three female specimens (mean age, 76.5 years; range, 67&ndash;92 years). The study involved fixing the left side of the trunk, upper limb, and spine and measuring clavicular displacement via an electromagnetic tracker. Distal clavicular dislocation was simulated with sequential sectioning of the deltoid, trapezius, AC, and CC ligaments, followed by DTOR as follows: Stage 0, intact; Stage 1, the deltoid, trapezius, AC ligament, and AC joint capsule were sectioned; Stage 2, the trapezoid ligament was sectioned; Stage 3, the conoid ligament was sectioned; and Stage 4, DTOR was performed. The superior displacement was measured during inferior traction of the upper limb, and the posterior and lateral displacements were measured during horizontal adduction of the upper limb.
Results: After sectioning the conoid ligament, the superior displacement significantly increased. Although performing DTOR afterward significantly reduced the superior displacement, it remained significantly larger than the displacement observed before sectioning the conoid ligament. Posterior and lateral displacements significantly increased after sectioning the conoid ligament but did not significantly decrease after DTOR.
Conclusion: The DTOR-induced restraint of the AC joint in the superior, posterior, and lateral directions to improve its dynamic stability of the AC joint was inferior to the static stability provided by the CC ligament. However, because DTOR can achieve superior stability of the AC joint, it can be performed as an additional reinforcement procedure for treating AC joint dislocation.
