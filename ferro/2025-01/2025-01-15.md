## 非Hermitian二聚的aharonov-bohm环中的磁通驱动的循环电流: 物理增益和损耗的影响

**Authors:** Souvik Roy, Santanu K. Maiti

arXiv:2501.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we explore magnetic response of a dimerized ring subjected to Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux and environmental interactions. Specifically, we introduce an imaginary site potential on the odd lattice sites to represent physical gain and loss, while the even lattice sites remain unperturbed. We investigate the induced current resulting from the AB flux in both real and imaginary eigenspaces, aiming to enhance this current significantly by adjusting the gain/loss parameter ($d$). Our analysis focuses on how exceptional points in the real and imaginary eigenenergy spaces contribute to notable increases in current at specific $d$ values, and the emergence of purely real current when the imaginary current vanishes. We focus on how the converging and diverging nature of the energy spectrum leads to gradual increases and decreases in the current. Additionally, we study the interplay between the correlations of dimerized hopping integrals and the gain-loss parameter, which affects the current and highlights key features associated with these physical parameters. Furthermore, we consider how system size impacts our findings. These investigations may reveal unconventional characteristics in various loop configurations, potentially paving the way for new research directions.

Abstract: Alternating twisted multilayer graphene presents a compelling multiband system for exploring superconductivity. Here we investigate robust superconductivity in alternating twisted quadralayer graphene, elucidating carrier contributions from both flat and dispersive bands. The superconductivity is robust, with a strong electrical field tunability, a maximum BKT transition temperature of 1.6 K, and high critical magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit. We disentangle the carrier density of Dirac bands and flat bands from the Landau fan diagram. Moreover, we could estimate the flatband Fermi velocity from the obtained high critical current near half filling when superconductivity is killed at finite magnetic fields, and further quantify the superfluid stiffness from the low critical current in the superconducting regime. Our results exhibit the electric field tunable coupling strength within the superconducting phase, revealing unconventional properties with vanishing Fermi velocity and large superfluid stiffness. These phenomena, attributed to substantial quantum metric contributions, offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying unconventional superconductivity in moire systems.

Abstract: The high-pressure growth technique is a vital approach that facilitates the stabilization of new phases and allows for meticulous control of structural parameters, which significantly impact electronic and magnetic properties. We present a short review of our ongoing investigations into various families of iron-based superconductors (IBS), employing the high-gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. This technique is capable of producing the gas pressures up to 1.8 GPa and a heating temperature of up to 1700 {\deg}C through a three-zone furnace within a cylindrical chamber. Different kinds of IBS samples are prepared using HPHTS and characterized through various measurements to reach the final conclusions. The results demonstrate that the high-pressure growth technique significantly enhances the properties of IBS, including the transition temperature, critical current density, and pinning force. In addition, the quality of the samples and their density are improved through the intergrain connections. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluations and investigations prove that a growth pressure of 0.5 GPa is sufficient for producing high-quality IBS bulks under the optimized synthesis conditions.

arXiv:2501.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the key factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength, strong contrast with the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction strength and the SOC strength, as well as that of the Rydberg interaction strength and the Raman coupling strength, respectively. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, soft-core long-range Rydberg interactions, and contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, the stability and superfluid properties of the two-component BECs with Raman-induced SOC and Rydberg interactions in free space are revealed by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. Finally, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.

# The Layer Hall Effect without External Electric Field

## 无外电场的层霍尔效应

**Authors:** Yulei Han, Yunpeng Guo, Zeyu Li, Zhenhua Qiao

arXiv:2501.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layer Hall effect is an intriguing phenomenon observed in magnetic topological layered materials, where the Hall response arises from the opposite deflection of electrons on top and bottom layers. To realize layer Hall effect, space-time $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is typically broken by applying an external electric field. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to realize the layer Hall effect by introducing inequivalent exchange fields on both surfaces of a topological insulator thin film, in the absence of an electric field. This approach yields a distinct Hall response compared to the conventional electric-field-induced layer Hall effect, particularly with respect to the Fermi level. Taking the topological insulator Sb$_2$Te$_3$ as a concrete example, we demonstrate the feasibility of inducing the layer Hall effect only by coupling the top and bottom surfaces of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with different magnetic insulators. Notably, we show that both built-in electric-field-induced and inequivalent exchange-fields-induced layer Hall effects can be achieved by tuning the stacking order between Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and the magnetic layers. Given the well-established experimental techniques for fabricating topological insulator thin films, our work offers a viable pathway for realizing layer Hall effect without external electric field.

Abstract: The achievement of selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond is challenging due to the emergence of competing phases such as its hexagonal polymorph or clathrates possessing similar free energy. Although both polymorphs exhibit a complete photonic bandgap, the cubic diamond exhibits it at lower frequencies than the hexagonal counterpart, positioning him as a promising candidate for photonic applications.Herein, we demonstrate that the 1:1 mixture of identical patchy particles cannot selectively form the cubic diamond polymorph due to the frustrations present in the system that are manifested in the primary adsorption layer and propagate as the film grows. We provide a plausible} explanation why the binary system under confinement, resembling interactions between the complementary DNA bases cannot yield the selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond crystals which is based on the similarities to the antiferromagnetic systems. We always observe the mixture of both hexagonal and cubic diamonds, however, the formation of such stacking hybrids is observed for a wider range of patch sizes compared to the one-component system.

Abstract: We report on an experimental study of spin and valley blockade in two-electron bilayer graphene (BLG) double quantum dots (DQDs) and explore the limits set by asymmetric orbitals and electronelectron interactions. The results obtained from magnetotransport measurements on two-electron BLG DQDs, where the resonant tunneling transport involves both orbital symmetric and antisymmetric two-particle states, show a rich level spectrum. We observe a magnetic field tunable spin and valley blockade, which is limited by the orbital splitting, the strength of the electron-electron interaction and the difference in the valley g-factors between the symmetric and antisymmetric twoparticle orbital states. Our conclusions are supported by simulations based on rate equations, which allow the identification of prominent interdot transitions associated with the transition from single to two-particle states observed in the experiment.

arXiv:2501.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to traits of CMOS compatibility and scalability, HfO2-based ferroelectrics are promising candidates for next-generation memory devices. However, their commercialization has been greatly hindered by reliability issues, with fatigue being a major impediment. We report the fatigue-free behavior in interface-designed Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based heterostructures. A coherent CeO2-x/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 heterointerface is constructed, wherein CeO2-x acts as an oxygen sponge, capable of reversibly accepting and releasing oxygen vacancies. This design effectively alleviates defect aggregation at the electrode-ferroelectric interface, enabling improved switching characteristics. Further, a symmetric capacitor architecture is designed to minimize the imprint, thereby suppressing the cycling-induced oriented defect drift. The two-pronged technique mitigates oxygen-voltammetry-generated chemical/energy fluctuations, suppressing the formation of paraelectric phase and polarization degradation. The design ensures a fatigue-free feature exceeding 10^11 switching cycles and an endurance lifetime surpassing 10^12 cycles for Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based capacitors, along with excellent temperature stability and retention. These findings pave the way for developing ultra-stable hafnia-based ferroelectric devices.

arXiv:2501.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals polytypes are commensurate configurations of two-dimensional layers with discrete crystalline symmetries and distinct stacking-dependent properties. In graphitic polytypes, the different stacking arrangements of graphene sheets exhibit rich electronic phases, such as intrinsic electric polarizations, orbital magnetizations, superconductivity, and anomalous fractional Hall states. Switching between these metastable periodic configurations by controlling interlayer shifts unlocks intriguing multiferroic responses. Here, we report super-lubricant arrays of polytypes (SLAP) devices, with nanometer-scale islands of Bernal polytypes that switch into Rhombohedral crystals and vice versa under a shear force as low as 6 nano-Newtons. We assemble these four-layer SLAP structures by aligning a pair of graphene bilayers above and under circular cavities in a misaligned spacer layer. Using local current measurements, we detect the shifts between the active bilayers and reveal long-range elastic relaxations outside the cavities that enable efficient nucleation and spontaneous sliding of stacking dislocation inside the islands. We demonstrate configurable, deterministic, and robust polytype switching by confining these boundary strips in narrow cavity channels that connect the islands. Such controlled switching between elastically-coupled single-crystalline islands is appealing for novel multiferroic SlideTronic applications.

**Authors:** San-Dong Guo, Xiao-Shu Guo, Guangzhao Wang

arXiv:2501.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Net-zero-magnetization magnets have garnered intensive research attention due to their ultradense and ultrafast potential. In terms of the symmetric classification of connecting magnetic atoms with opposite spin polarization, the net-zero-magnetization magnets mainly include $PT$-antiferromagnet (the joint symmetry ($PT$) of space inversion symmetry ($P$) and time-reversal symmetry ($T$)), altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet. Studying transitions among net-zero-magnetization magnets is essentially the research on symmetry breaking, which can also clearly reveal the transformation of spin-splitting symmetry. Symmetry breaking can be achieved through methods such as Janus engineering, isovalent alloying, and external electric field. Here, we start from a parent $PT$-antiferromagnet that simultaneously possesses both $P$ and rotational/mirror symmetries to induce altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet. Based on first-principles calculations, the proposed transitions can be verified in $PT$-antiferromagnet $\mathrm{CrC_2S_6}$ monolayer. By Janus engineering and isovalent alloying, $\mathrm{CrC_2S_6}$ can change into altermagnetic $\mathrm{CrC_2S_3Se_3}$ and fully-compensated ferrimagnetic $\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_6}$. The $\mathrm{CrC_2S_3Se_3}$ can also become fully-compensated ferrimagnetic $\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_3Se_3}$ by isovalent alloying. Our work provides a clear and intuitive example to explain the transitions among net-zero-magnetization magnets, which can inspire more research on net-zero-magnetization magnets.

Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the band structures of chirally twisted triple bilayer graphene. The new kind of moir\'e structure, formed by three pieces of helically stacked Bernal bilayer graphene, has flat bands at charge neutral point based on the continuum approximation. We experimentally confirm the existence of flat bands and directly acquire the gap in-between flat bands as well as between the flat bands and dispersive bands from the capacitance measurements. We discover a finite gap even at zero perpendicular electric field, possibly induced by the Coulomb interaction and ferromagnetism. Our quantitative study not only provides solid evidence for the flat-band and interesting physics, but also introduces a quantitative approach to explore phenomena of similar moir\'e systems.

Abstract: The dynamic behavior and stabilization of skyrmions in magnetic multilayers are critical for advancing spintronic and magnonic technologies. In our study, we investigate the static and dynamic properties of $[Re/Co(d_{Co})/Pt]_{20}$ multilayers with varying Co thicknesses $(6\text{-}24 \, \text{\r{A}})$, showcasing a transition from out-of-plane to in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Magnetization reversal leads to a transformation from labyrinth domains to skyrmion bubbles due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). Using angle-dependent imaging at remanence, we confirm that skyrmions can be stabilized without an external magnetic field at specific polar angles, with the stabilization angle increasing alongside Co thickness. Ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals four distinct resonant modes, including low-frequency $(2\text{-}18\text{GHz})$, high-frequency $(20\text{-}35 \, \text{GHz})$ modes, depending on the magnetization texture. The frequency range of these modes narrows with decreasing effective anisotropy and iDMI strength decreases in thicker Co layers in perpendicular configurations. Moreover, we observe a decrease in effective Gilbert damping with increasing Co thickness, highlighting the potential for efficient energy dissipation. These findings link between material properties and skyrmion dynamics directly and demonstrate tunable resonant modes for magnonic devices. By addressing both static and dynamic aspects, our work advances the development of next-generation spintronic and magnonic applications.

Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 142 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi surface, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring large anomalous Hall response in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.

# Theory of Order-Disorder Phase Transitions Induced by Fluctuations Based on Network Models

Abstract: Both quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic phase transitions are probably induced by fluctuations, yet the specific mechanism through which fluctuations cause phase transitions remains unclear in existing theories. This paper summarizes different phases into combinations of three types of network structures based on lattice models transformed into network models and the principle of maximum entropy. These three network structures correspond to ordered, boundary, and disordered conditions, respectively. By utilizing the transformation relationships satisfied by these three network structures and classical probability, this work derive the high-order detailed balance relationships satisfied by strongly correlated systems. Using the high-order detailed balance formula, this work obtain the weights of the maximum entropy network structures in general cases. Consequently, I clearly describe the process of ordered-disordered phase transitions based on fluctuations and provide critical exponents and phase transition points. Finally, I verify this theory using the Ising model in different dimensions, the frustration scenario of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, and the expectation of ground-state energy in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.

Abstract: Incommensurate magnetic phases in chiral cubic crystals are an established source of topological spin textures such as skyrmion and hedgehog lattices, with potential applications in spintronics and information storage. We report a comprehensive small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) study on the $B20$-type chiral magnet Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge, exploring its magnetic phase diagram and confirming the stabilization of a skyrmion lattice under low magnetic fields. Our results reveal a helical ground state with a decreasing pitch from 40 nm to 35 nm upon cooling, and a skyrmion phase stable in applied magnetic fields of 10-30 mT, and over an unusually wide temperature range for chiral magnets of 6 K ($\sim T_\textrm{C}/2 < T < T_\textrm{C}$, $T_\textrm{C}=13$ K). The skyrmion lattice forms a standard two-dimensional hexagonal coordination that can be trained into a single domain, distinguishing it from the three-dimensional hedgehog lattice observed in MnGe-based systems. Additionally, we demonstrate the persistence of a metastable SkL at 2 K, even at zero field. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic textures in Cr-based $B20$ compounds, highlighting Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge~as a promising material for further exploration in topological magnetism.

Abstract: Nonvolatile control of spin order or spin excitations offers a promising avenue for advancing spintronics; however, practical implementation remains challenging. In this letter, we propose a general framework to realize electrical control of magnons in 2D magnetic insulators. We demonstrate that in bilayer ferromagnetic insulators with strong spin-layer coupling, electric field Ez can effectively manipulate the spin exchange interactions between the layers, enabling nonvolatile control of the corresponding magnons. Notably, in this bilayer, Ez can induce nonzero Berry curvature and orbital moments of magnons, the chirality of which are coupled to the direction of Ez. This coupling facilitates Ez manipulate the corresponding magnon valley and orbital Hall currents. Furthermore, such bilayers can be easily engineered, as demonstrated by our density-functional-theory calculations on Janus bilayer Cr-based ferromagnets. Our work provides an important step toward realizing nonvolatile magnonics and paves a promising way for future magnetoelectric coupling devices.

Abstract: Electron glasses offer a convenient laboratory platform to study glassy dynamics. Traditionally, the interplay between long-range Coulomb interactions and disorder is deemed instrumental in stabilizing the electron glass phase. Existing experimental studies on electron glass have focused on doped semiconductors, strongly correlated systems, granular systems, etc., all of which are far from the well-delocalized limit. In this work, we expand the study of electron glasses to a well-known quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and unveil a new scenario: how naturally occurring ferroelastic twin walls of STO could result in glassy electrons, even in a metallic state. We show that the emergent two-dimensional electron gas at the $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/STO interface exhibits long-lasting temporal relaxations in resistance and memory effects at low temperatures, which are hallmarks of glassiness. We also demonstrate that the glass-like relaxations could be further tuned by application of an electric field. This implies that the observed glassy dynamics is connected with the development of polarity near the structural twin walls of STO and the complex interactions among them, arising from the coupling between ferroelastic and ferroelectric orders. The observation of this glassy metal phase not only extends the concept of electron glasses to metallic systems with multiple order parameters but also contributes to the growing understanding of the fascinating and diverse physical phenomena that emerge near the quantum critical point.

Abstract: We introduce and implement a reformulation of the strong disorder renormalization group (SDRG) in real space, which is well suited to study bond disordered power law long range coupled, antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. We derive the distribution function of couplings $J$ with corrections to the previously derived strong disorder fixed point distribution, which depend on power exponent $\alpha$ and coupling anisotropy $\gamma.$
  As a consequence, the low temperature magnetic susceptibility is found to diverge with an anomalous power law. The distribution of singlet lengths is found to decay more slowly than obtained previously, with severe consequences for physical properties. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem of length $n$ is thereby found to increase with a power law, rather than logarithmically, corresponding to a subvolume law for sufficiently large $\alpha$. We argue that volume law entanglement entropy can appear due to the emergence of rainbow states. A formula for $\alpha_c$ below which such rainbow states emerge is given.

Abstract: One of the cornerstones of spintronics is the application of a spin-transfer torque to a nanomagnet, driving the magnetization of the nanomagnet into a steady-state precession and realizing a spin-torque oscillator. Such a steady state, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a textbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical descriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here, based on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which allows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the absence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not allowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin relaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin relaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization dynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent precessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation causes a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied voltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and study the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of understanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.

Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of MnRuAs, a compound crystallizing in the P$\bar{6}$2m symmetry with a distorted kagome lattice, revealing its distinctive structural, magnetic, and electronic properties through state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. By incorporating strong correlation effects using the DFT+U approach, we demonstrate the stabilization of MnRuAs, transforming its inherent dynamical instability into a robust ferromagnetic state with significant coupling along the $c$ axis. The calculated magnon dispersion reveals a parabolic profile with a minimum at the $\Gamma$ point, indicative of ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, MnRuAs exhibits intriguing electronic properties, including quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface and the formation of nodal sphere. Our study also delves into the electronic surface states and constant energy contours, offering valuable insights into the complex physics of this material.

Abstract: The directional coupler is a fundamental element of wave-based circuits. The state of the art for the spin-wave directional couplers consists mostly of macroscopic waveguides or two-dimensional planar systems. In this Letter, we present the design of the nanoscale spin-wave vertical directional coupler with a very high efficiency exceeding 99.5%. We demonstrate that the operation of the coupler can be controlled by the magnitude of the external magnetic field. Moreover, it can perform multiplexing and demultiplexing of the spin-wave signal. Such a device ought to become an essential element of the three-dimensional magnonic circuits.

Abstract: Nonreciprocal charge transport in solids, where resistance is different between rightward and leftward currents, is a key function of rectifying devices in the modern electronics, as exemplified by $p$-$n$ semiconductor junctions. Recently, this was also demonstrated in noncentrosymmetric materials in magnetic fields, since their band structure exhibits spin polarization coupled to the position of momentum space due to the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling. To enhance the magnitude of nonreciprocal effect, it is essential to tune such spin-momentum coupling, which has been hampered in the conventional materials owing to the difficulty in controlling the broken inversion symmetry built into the lattice and interfacial structures. Here we report large nonreciprocal resistivity in layered polar metal BaMn$X_2$ ($X$=Sb, Bi), where the spin-polarized Dirac dispersion depends on the in-plane polarization tunable by chemical substitution of the $X$ site. For $X$=Sb with a pair of single-type valleys, the nonreciprocal resistivity increases monotonically with decreasing temperature, while for $X$=Bi with multiple types of valleys it is reduced by about an order of magnitude and exhibits a peak at a low temperature. Theoretical calculations indicate that the nonreciprocal resistivity is sensitive not only to the spin-momentum (spin-valley) coupling, but also to the Fermi energy and the Dirac dispersion. The observed significant variation of nonreciprocal transport in the same series of materials might be of great use in the design of junction-free rectifying devices and circuits.

Abstract: We observe the magnetic quantum oscillation in the heat capacity of the Kondo insulator YbB$_{12}$. The frequency of these oscillations $F = 670$ T, aligns with findings from magnetoresistance and torque magnetometry experiments for $\mu_0 H > 35$ T in the Kondo insulating phase. Remarkably, the quantum oscillation amplitudes in the heat capacity are substantial, with $\Delta \tilde{C}/T \approx$ 0.5 $\rm{mJ}$ $\rm{mol^{-1}K^{-2}}$ at 0.8 K, accounting for 13$\%$ of the known linear heat capacity coefficient $\gamma$. Double-peak structures of quantum-oscillation amplitudes due to the distribution function of fermions were identified and used to determine the value of the effective mass from the heat capacity, which agrees well with that from torque magnetometry. These observations support charge-neutral fermions contributing to the quantum oscillations in YbB$_{12}$.

Abstract: Cluster magnetic multipoles are order parameters that describe the symmetry of spin arrangements in magnetic materials. High-order multipoles are particularly important in non-collinear antiferromagnets, where they determine key physical properties such as the anomalous Hall effect and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Although non-uniform multipole states have been observed at the micrometer scale, their mesoscopic properties remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general micromagnetic formalism for cluster magnetic multipoles, enabling the study of the spin dynamics in non-uniform multipole systems. As an example, we apply this formalism to investigate magnetic-octupole domain-wall dynamics in the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Our results capture key features of domain-wall motion, including deformation and the emergence of effective inertial mass. This study provides a general framework for studying the dynamics of high-order cluster magnetic multipoles, which is essential for determining the mesoscopic physical properties of non-collinear magnetic materials.

Abstract: Since its discovery, graphene has been one of the most prominent 2D materials due to its unique properties and broad range of possible applications. In particular, the half-integer Quantum Hall Effect (HI-QHE) characterized by the quantization of Hall resistivity as a function of applied magnetic field, offers opportunities for advancements in quantum metrology and the understanding of topological quantum states in this 2D material. While the role of disorder in stabilizing quantum Hall plateaus (QHPs) is widely recognized, the precise interplay between the plateaus width, disorder, mobility and carrier density remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the width of the $\nu=6$ QHP in epitaxial graphene Hall bars, focusing on two distinct regions of the device with markedly different electronic mobilities. Depending on the storage conditions, it is possible to modify the carrier density of graphene QHE devices and consequently increase or reduce the mobility. Our experiments reveal mobility variations of up to 200$\%$ from their initial value. In particular, the sample storage time and ambient conditions cause also noticeable changes in the positions and extension of the QHPs. Our results show that the QHP extension for $\nu=6$ differs significantly between the two regions, influenced by both mobility and disorder, rather than solely by carrier density. Transport simulations based on the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism with Anderson disorder in a scaled model reveal the critical role of impurities in shaping graphene transport properties defining the extension of the QHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay between mobility, disorder, and quantum transport in graphene systems.

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the periodic Anderson model on the square lattice across various band fillings. Employing the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) technique, we can determine the magnetic ground states accurately and compare them to mean-field predictions to highlight the effects of quantum fluctuations. At half-filling, we analyze the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic (Kondo singlet) phases as a function of hybridization and $f$-level energy, finding excellent agreement with existing quantum Monte Carlo studies in the case of hybridization. For $n = 1.5$ electrons per site, we identify a novel correlated antiferromagnetic diagonal stripe phase as the ground state, which competes with its ferromagnetic partner state.

Abstract: The local point group symmetry of luminescent centers, such as defects, impurities, and dopant ions within a crystal, dictates their optical transition properties. While conventional low-temperature spectroscopy quantifies point group symmetry by enumerating the splitting of optical transitions, it fails to capture vectorial symmetry information, such as the orientation of symmetry axes. Here, we establish a quantitative link between point group symmetry, crystal symmetry, optical transition dipole orientation, and polarized luminescence in rare-earth-doped single-particle crystals using computational electromagnetism. Combined with room-temperature single-particle polarization spectroscopy, we resolve the magnetic dipole orientations from individual optical transition of dopant ions in single microcrystal, enabling precise identification of point group symmetry and its axes. We observe single-particle chirality arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking of intrinsically chiral space group during crystallization. Based on point group and crystal symmetries, we present a practical scheme to optical sensing the 3D orientation of rare-earth-doped single particles in dynamic environments by using two arbitrarily transition bands from single-view polarization spectra. Our computational electromagnetism framework not only elucidates polarized luminescence but also provides insights into optimizing dipole orientation-dependent energy transfer for designing ultra-bright rare-earth-doped nanocrystals, such as F\"orster resonance energy transfer, and can interpret enhanced linear polarization in extreme optical phenomena like stimulated emission, superradiance, and superfluorescence following dipole-coherent radiation in single emitters.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions, a significant challenge remains in crafting nontrivial high-order skyrmionic textures with varying, or even tailor-made, topologies. We address this challenge, by focusing on a construction pathway of skyrmionic metamaterials within a monolayer thin film and suggest several skyrmionic metamaterials that are surprisingly stable, i.e., long-lived, due to a self-stabilization mechanism. This makes these new textures promising for applications. Central to our approach is the concept of 'simulated controlled assembly', in short, a protocol inspired by 'click chemistry' that allows for positioning topological magnetic structures where one likes, and then allowing for energy minimization to elucidate the stability. Utilizing high-throughput atomistic-spin-dynamic simulations alongside state-of-the-art AI-driven tools, we have isolated skyrmions (topological charge Q=1), antiskyrmions (Q=-1), and skyrmionium (Q=0). These entities serve as foundational 'skyrmionic building blocks' to form the here reported intricate textures. In this work, two key contributions are introduced to the field of skyrmionic systems. First, we present a a novel combination of atomistic spin dynamics simulations and controlled assembly protocols for the stabilization and investigation of new topological magnets. Second, using the aforementioned methods we report on the discovery of skyrmionic metamaterials.

Abstract: Residual entropy, reflecting the degrees of freedom in a system at absolute zero temperature, is important for understanding quantum and classical ground states. Despite its key role in explaining low-temperature phenomena and ground state degeneracy, accurately measuring residual entropy remains a difficult task due to computational challenges. In this Letter, we introduce the Temperature Incremental Monte Carlo (TIMC) method, our new approach to solve these challenges. The TIMC method incrementally calculates the partition function ratio of neighboring temperatures within Monte Carlo simulations, enabling precise entropy calculations and revealing many other temperature-dependent properties in a single computational sweep of temperatures. We have thoroughly tested TIMC on several complex systems, such as the frustrated antiferromagnetic Ising model on both C60 and 2D triangular lattices, the Newman-Moore glassy model, and a 2D quantum transverse field Ising model. Notably, our method overcomes the difficulties encountered in partition function measurements when mapping $d$-dimensional quantum models to $d+1$-dimensional classical counterparts. These difficulties arise from the singular interactions that emerge in the small $\Delta_\tau$ limit during the quantum-to-classical mapping procedure. The TIMC method enables precise entropy calculations across the entire temperature range, as demonstrated in our studies of frustrated spin models, glassy phases, and phases exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method's capability in calculating residual entropy could provide new insights when applied to systems lacking analytical solutions.

Abstract: We present an efficient method of calculating the vibrational spectrum of a magnetic molecule adsorbed on a superconductor, directly related to the first derivative of the tunneling $IV$ curve. The work is motivated by a recent scanning-tunneling spectroscopy of lead phthalocyanine on superconducting Pb(100), showing a wealth of vibrational excitations, the number of which highly exceeds molecular vibrations typically encountered on normal metals. We design a minimal model which represents the inelastic transitions by the spectral function of a frontier orbital of the molecule in isolation. The model allows for an exact solution; otherwise the full correlated superconducting problem would be hard to treat. The model parameters are supplied from an ab-initio calculation, where the presence of the surface on the deformation of molecular geometry can be taken into account. The spectral function of the highest-occupied molecular orbital of the anionic PbPc$^{1-}$ shows the best agreement with the experimental reference among other molecular charge states and orbitals. The method allows to include multiple vibrational transitions straightforwardly.

Abstract: The honeycomb Kitaev model describes a $Z_2$ spin liquid with topological order and fractionalized excitations consisting of gapped $\pi$-fluxes and free Majorana fermions. Competing interactions, even when not very strong, are known to destabilize the Kitaev spin liquid. Magnetic fields are a convenient parameter for tuning between different phases of the Kitaev systems, and have even been investigated for potentially counteracting the effects of other destabilizing interactions leading to a revival of the topological phase. Here we review the progress in understanding the effects of magnetic fields on some of the perturbed Kitaev systems, particularly on fractionalization and topological order.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.

Abstract: Initializing the ground state of a quantum bit (qubit) based on Majorana zero modes is one of the most pressing issues for future topological quantum computers. We explore a protocol for initializing such topological qubits based on magnet-superconductor hybrid networks by coupling magnetic chains to a single molecule magnet. The parity of the Majorana state is converted to the presence or absence of a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state at the molecule. The coupling can be activated by switching the spin state of the molecule, allowing the ground-state parity of the chain to be controlled. We demonstrate that initialization with either parity for a Majorana qubit can be achieved. We then introduce the augmented Majorana qubit, which includes the state of the molecule in the definition of the logical qubit. Using this definition we can initialize a qubit without high-precision timing.

Abstract: Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconducting circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconducting InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.

Abstract: Nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spectroscopy reveals chemical bonding patterns in materials and molecules through the unique coupling between nuclear spins and local fields. However, traditional NQR techniques require macroscopic ensembles of nuclei to yield a detectable signal, which precludes the study of individual molecules and obscures molecule-to-molecule variations due to local perturbations or deformations. Optically active electronic spin qubits, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, facilitate the detection and control of individual nuclei through their local magnetic couplings. Here, we use NV centers to perform NQR spectroscopy on their associated nitrogen-14 ($^{14}$N) nuclei at room temperature. In mapping the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian, we resolve minute variations between individual nuclei. The measurements further reveal correlations between the parameters in the NV center's electronic spin Hamiltonian and the $^{14}$N quadropolar Hamiltonian, as well as a previously unreported Hamiltonian term that results from symmetry breaking. We further design pulse sequences to initialize, readout, and control the quantum evolution of the $^{14}$N nuclear state using the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian.

Abstract: Altermagnetism exhibits zero net magnetization and spin-splitting electronic structure. The interplay between altermagnetism and topological physics becomes an important topic in the condensed matter physics. In this letter, we propose that the altermagnet Ce4Sb3 hosts Dirac fermions through first-principles calculations and tight-binding model analysis. When subjected to external magnetic field, the altermagnet Ce4Sb3 change from altermagnetic state to ferromagnetic state. Accompanied with magnetic order transition, the four-fold degenerate Dirac points are transited into sextuple degenerate points. Especially, spin-orbital coupling effect has little influence about the Dirac fermions. The topological phases in the altermagnetic state may hold the exotic spin-splitter torque and remarkable nonlinear transport effect. Our work paves the way for exploring the interplay between altermagnetism and non-trivial topological phase.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the magnetoelastic properties of the Ising pyrochlore oxide Ho$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$, known as spin ice, by means of high-field magnetostriction measurements and numerical calculations. When a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic <111> axis, the longitudinal magnetostriction exhibits a broad maximum in the low-field regime around 30 T, followed by a dramatic lattice contraction due to crystal-field (CF) level crossing at $B_{\rm cf} \sim 65$ T. The transverse magnetostriction exhibits a contrasting behavior, highlighting the anisotropic nature of the CF striction. We identify distinct timescales of spin dynamics and CF-phonon dynamics by applying a magnetic field with different field-sweep rates. Our mean-field calculations, based on a point-charge model, successfully reproduce the overall magnetostriction behavior, revealing the competition between the exchange striction and CF striction. A signature of the CF level crossing is also observed through adiabatic magnetocaloric-effect measurements, consistent with our magnetostriction data.

Abstract: The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current that is generated once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions and antiferromagnetic bimerons that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity. Skyrmionic textures serve as generators of orbital currents that can transport information and give rise to considerable orbital torques.

Abstract: Density functional theory is used to study the effect of compressive and tensile biaxial strain on Mn$_{3}$GaN. Mn$_{3}$GaN is a non-collinear antiferromagnetic antiperovskite with a similar structure to that of an ideal cubic oxide perovskite, but with cations at the octahedral sites while the anion, nitrogen, is found at the B site. The present study explores the response of Mn$_{3}$GaN to (001) strain, considering biaxial strain levels ranging from -5% to 5%. It is found that the electron structure is insensitive to tensile strain. The study supports previous results in that a spin-canted antiferromagnetic order emerges due to tensile strain, inducing net magnetization. Compressive strain collapses the non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin structure and induces a ferrimagnetic order at -2% strain. Notably, in contrast with oxide perovskites, Mn$_{3}$GaN does not respond to strain by octahedral tilt, but rather by intraband redistributions of charge between Mn $d$ states. Despite the similar structure to oxide perovskites, the bonds between the B site anion and octahedral site cations in Mn$_{3}$GaN bonds are less rigid, such that strain is instead accommodated by a change in bond length rather than a change in bond angles.

Abstract: We demonstrate in-situ manipulation of the critical temperature ($T_S$) and upper critical field ($H_{C2}$) of conventional and unconventional superconductors via ultrasonic excitation. Using an AC susceptibility measurements, we observed a reduction in $T_S$ with increasing amplitude of the applied ultrasonic waves. This reduction exhibits a power law dependence on the excitation voltage, suggesting a non-linear coupling between the ultrasonic waves and the superconducting order parameter. Analogous behavior was observed in cuprate superconductors, hinting at a possible link between the modified superconducting properties and the modulation of the antiferromagnetic network by ultrasonic excitation. Measurements on a paramagnetic material (Gd$_2$O$_3$) with quenched orbital angular momentum (L\,=\,0) revealed no change in magnetization even at extreme ultrasonic excitation amplitudes. This highlights the role of spin-orbit coupling in the observed effects and rules out the possibility of local temperature increases affecting the measurements. To further confirm this, we conducted auxiliary experiments where a Cernox temperature sensor was subjected to ultrasonic excitation, and the resulting temperature difference relative to a reference Cernox was recorded. Simultaneously, the power difference was measured to assess the impact of ultrasonic heating. This analysis revealed that localized heating effects become dominant above an ultrasonic amplitude of 10 V$_{pp}$.

Abstract: The magnetic ground-state configuration of iron selenide FeSe has been a topic of debate, with experimental evidence suggesting the stripe spin fluctuations as predominant at low temperatures, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations using exchange-correlation (XC) functional of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) have historically predicted the antiferromagnetic (AFM) dimer configuration. In this study, we utilize the $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ functional, a variant of the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) meta-GGA, to investigate the magnetic configurations of FeSe. It is found that $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ predicts a stripe-AFM ground-state configuration with an anti-parallel spin alignment between layers. The energy difference between the parallel and anti-parallel inter-planar spin alignments is approximately 1.7 meV/atom, predicting a significant but previously unreported interlayer spin coupling not yet observed by experiments. The present study underscores the importance of accurate XC functionals, such as $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$, in predicting the magnetic ground-state configuration of complex materials like FeSe, highlighting its potential to predict magnetic interactions more reliably than traditional GGA functionals by adhering to exact constraints.

Abstract: We report on the spin dynamics of two Terbium-based molecular nanomagnets, Tb-SQ and Tb-Trp, investigated by means of longitudinal muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements as a function of applied field, flanked by AC susceptibility characterization. In the two molecules Tb(III) magnetic ion has an isotructural coordination sphere, but in the former the Tb(III) is coordinated by an organic paramagnetic ligand (SQ), while the latter is coordinated by a diamagnetic one (Trp). Thus Tb-SQ presents an exchange interaction between the Tb(III) ion and a radical while Tb-Trp does not. Both the samples exhibit a muon spin-lattice relaxation rate $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ peak in the temperature range 10-25 K at all applied longitudinal magnetic fields $B_L = 50, 150, 300$ mT. In Tb-SQ, $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ displays a BPP-like behavior led by three different correlations times: the first, dominating for $T\geq15K$, follows a thermally activated law $\tau_c =\tau_0 \exp(\sigma_A / k_B T)$ with energy barrier $\sigma_A/k_B$, while the second and third ones, dominating respectively for $8<15$ K and $T<8$ K, follow a power-law-like behavior $\tau_c = c_0 T^{-\alpha}$ with two different values of $c_0$ and $\alpha$. On the other hand, the temperature and field behavior of $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ in Tb-Trp strongly deviates from a BPP law, displaying a strongly anomalous character. Our results indicate that, in the absence of an exchange interaction and maintaining all the other relevant interactions constants, the local spin dynamics of single ion magnets strongly differ from the one observed in the presence of such interaction. The combination of $\mu$SR and AC susceptibility allows us to disentangle the different Orbach, Raman and direct mechanisms which are the key ingredients that control the spin dynamics in Tb-SQ, and evidence the potentiality of $\mu$SR in elucidating complex spin dynamics.

Abstract: An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.

Abstract: By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the isotropic exchange coupling is equally important as the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya (DM) interaction in determining the magnon Hall effect, and it can transform to the latter under proper gauge transformation. Moreover, the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the magnon Hall effect without the DM interaction. Both features are exemplified in ferromagnetic honeycomb lattices. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.

Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moir\'e lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.

Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.

Abstract: We investigate key quantum characteristics of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer under the influence of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we analyze the distributions of bipartite and tripartite entanglement quantified through the respective negativities, and the $l_1$-norm of coherence with the help of rigorous analytical and numerical methods. Our findings suggest that the heterotrinuclear molecular nanomagnet $[\{\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{L}\}_2\text{Ni}^\text{II}(\text{H}_2\text{O})_2](\text{ClO}_4)_{2} . 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$, which represents an experimental realization of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer, exhibits a significant bipartite entanglement between $\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ and $\text{Ni}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions along with robust tripartite entanglement among all three constituent $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions. The significant bipartite and tripartite entanglement persists even at relatively high temperatures up to $37\,\text{K}$ and magnetic fields up to $46\,\text{T}$, whereby the coherence is maintained even at elevated temperatures. {It is evidenced that the aforementioned molecular complex with the magnetic core $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ provides an intriguing quantum resource, which exhibits a star-shaped state within the singlet eigenstate at low magnetic fields and W-like state within the triplet eigenstate at moderate magnetic fields.

Abstract: This study provides insights into the static and dynamic quantum properties of the trinuclear high-spin iron(III) molecular complex $[\mathrm{Fe}_3\mathrm{Cl}_3(\mathrm{saltag^\mathrm{Br}})(\mathrm{py})_6]\mathrm{ClO}_4$ to be further abbreviated as Fe$_3$. Using exact diagonalization of a spin-5/2 Heisenberg triangle in a magnetic field, we model the corresponding quantum behavior of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our rigorous analysis employs various key metrics to explore a rich quantum behavior of this molecular compound. At sufficiently low temperatures, the bipartite negativity reveals that the pairwise entanglement between any pair of iron(III) magnetic ions of the molecular complex Fe$_3$ can be significantly enhanced by a small magnetic field. This enhancement is followed by unconventional step-like changes characterized by a sequence of plateaus and sudden downturns as the magnetic field further increases. A qualitatively similar behavior is also observed in the genuine tripartite entanglement among all three iron(III) magnetic ions in the trinuclear complex Fe$_3$. Notably, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement persist in the molecular complex Fe$_3$ up to moderate temperatures of approximately 30~K and 70~K, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the achievement of quantum-enhanced sensitivity by initializing the molecular complex Fe$_3$ in Dicke states. Finally, we investigated a quantum-sensing protocol by applying a local magnetic field specifically to one iron(III) magnetic ion of the molecular compound Fe$_3$ and performing readout sequentially on one of two remaining iron(III) magnetic ions.

Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs) actuated by nanosecond pulses are emerging as promising devices for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic behavior and high throughput. In this work, we study the tunability and quality of random-number distributions generated by pMTJs operating at a frequency of 104 MHz. First, changing the pulse amplitude is used to systematically vary the probability bias. The variance of the resulting bitstreams is shown to follow the expected binomial distribution. Second, the quality of uniform distributions of 8-bit random numbers generated with a probability bias of 0.5 is considered. A reduced chi-square analysis of this data shows that two XOR operations are necessary to achieve this distribution with p-values greater than 0.05. Finally, we show that there is a correlation between long-term probability bias variations and pMTJ resistance. These findings suggest that variations in the characteristics of the pMTJ underlie the observed variation of probability bias. Our results highlight the potential of stochastically actuated pMTJs for high-speed, tunable TRNG applications, showing the importance of the stability of pMTJs device characteristics in achieving reliable, long-term performance.

Abstract: The conefield variant of a Converse KAM method for 3D vector fields, identifying regions through which no invariant 2-tori pass transverse to a specified direction field, is tested on some helical perturbations of an axisymmetric magnetic field in toroidal geometry. This implementation computes bounds on the slopes of invariant tori of a given class and allows to apply a subsidiary criterion for the extension of the non-existence region, saving significant computation time. The method finds regions corresponding to magnetic islands and chaos for the fieldline flow.

arXiv:2501.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a two-dimensional nonlinear system of equations for the electrostatic potential envelope and the low-frequency magnetic field perturbation to describe the interaction of the upper hybrid wave propagating perpendicular to an external magnetic field with the dust-ion-magnetoacoustic (DIMA) wave in a magnetized dusty plasma. The equations contain both scalar and vector nonlinearities. A nonlinear dispersion relation is derived and the decay and modulation instability thresholds and growth rates are obtained. Numerical estimates show that instability thresholds can easily be exceeded in real dusty plasmas. In the static (subsonic) approximation, a two-dimensional (2D) soliton solution (ground state) is found numerically by the generalized Petviashvili relaxation method. The perturbations of the magnetic field and plasma density in the soliton are nonmonotonic in space and, along with the perturbation in the form of a well, there are also perturbation humps. Such peculiar radial soliton profiles differ significantly from previously known results on 2D solitons. The key point is that the presence of a gap in the DIMA wave dispersion due to the Rao cutoff frequency causes the nonlinearity to be nonlocal. We show that due to nonlocal nonlinearity the Hamiltonian is bounded below at fixed energy, proving the stability of the ground state.

Abstract: Hydraulic structures such as dams have a direct or indirect influence on the hydro-sedimentary functioning of rivers. They can impact the sediment continuity of the river and can create a sediment imbalance with zones of sediment accumulation upstream and a lack of sediment downstream from the dam. Upstream deposits are a major issue for managers as they can impact the operation and/oraffect the safety of the structure and induce extra-flood hazards. Operators therefore seek to determine the physical characteristics of these deposits to determine their remobilization potential.Usually, these sediment deposits are described using bathymetric data, sonar images or samples (dredging, coring). For this study, new measurements from two geophysical methods (acoustic and electromagnetic) were used in addition to these current monitoring methods. The contribution of geophysical techniques is undeniable to improve the characterization of these deposits. These measurements make it possible to: i) define the internal structures of the sediments, ii) determine the spatial distribution of these structures over the entire development, iii) evaluate the volumes deposited when little bathymetric data is available on the reservoir. The coupling of these methods thus makes it possible to reconstruct the evolution and the structuring events of the sedimentary deposits. This approach provides complementary and important elements for managers in terms of exploitation and optimization of sedimentary deposits management scenarios.

Abstract: The local point group symmetry of luminescent centers, such as defects, impurities, and dopant ions within a crystal, dictates their optical transition properties. While conventional low-temperature spectroscopy quantifies point group symmetry by enumerating the splitting of optical transitions, it fails to capture vectorial symmetry information, such as the orientation of symmetry axes. Here, we establish a quantitative link between point group symmetry, crystal symmetry, optical transition dipole orientation, and polarized luminescence in rare-earth-doped single-particle crystals using computational electromagnetism. Combined with room-temperature single-particle polarization spectroscopy, we resolve the magnetic dipole orientations from individual optical transition of dopant ions in single microcrystal, enabling precise identification of point group symmetry and its axes. We observe single-particle chirality arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking of intrinsically chiral space group during crystallization. Based on point group and crystal symmetries, we present a practical scheme to optical sensing the 3D orientation of rare-earth-doped single particles in dynamic environments by using two arbitrarily transition bands from single-view polarization spectra. Our computational electromagnetism framework not only elucidates polarized luminescence but also provides insights into optimizing dipole orientation-dependent energy transfer for designing ultra-bright rare-earth-doped nanocrystals, such as F\"orster resonance energy transfer, and can interpret enhanced linear polarization in extreme optical phenomena like stimulated emission, superradiance, and superfluorescence following dipole-coherent radiation in single emitters.

Abstract: Biosensing based on optically trapped fluorescent nanodiamonds is an intriguing research direction potentially allowing to resolve biochemical processes inside living cells. Towards this goal, we investigate infrared near (NIR) laser irradiation at 1064 nm on fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we aim to understand how NIR exposure influences the fluorescence and sensing properties of FNDs and to determine the potential implications for the use of FNDs in various sensing applications. The experimental setup involved exposing FNDs to varying intensities of NIR laser light and analyzing the resultant changes in their optical and physical properties. Key measurements included T1 relaxation times, optical spectroscopy, and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra. The findings reveal how increased NIR laser power correlates with alterations in ODMR central frequency but also that charge state dynamics under NIR irradiation of NV centers plays a role. We suggest protocols with NIR and green light that mitigate the effect of NIR, and demonstrate that FND biosensing works well with such a protocol.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetism, characterized by magnetic moments aligned in alternating directions with a vanished ensemble average, has garnered renewed interest for its potential applications in spintronics and axion dynamics. The synergy between antiferromagnetism and topology can lead to the emergence of an exotic topological phase unique to certain magnetic order, termed antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AF TIs). A hallmark signature of AF TIs is the presence of a single surface Dirac cone--a feature typically associated with strong three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators--only on certain symmetry-preserving crystal terminations. However, the direct observation of this phenomenon poses a significant challenge. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally discovered a 3D photonic AF TI hosting a single surface Dirac cone protected by the combined symmetry of time reversal and half-lattice translation. Conceptually, our setup can be viewed as a z-directional stack of two-dimensional Chern insulators, with adjacent layers oppositely magnetized to form a 3D type-A AF configuration. By measuring both bulk and surface states, we have directly observed the symmetry-protected gapless single-Dirac-cone surface state, which shows remarkable robustness against random magnetic disorders. Our work constitutes the first realization of photonic AF TIs and photonic analogs of strong topological insulators, opening a new chapter for exploring novel topological photonic devices and phenomena that incorporate additional magnetic degrees of freedom.

Abstract: Two samples of silicon pad sensors and two samples of GaAs sensors are studied in an electron beam with 5 GeV energy from the DESY-II test-beam facility. The sizes of the silicon and GaAs sensors are about 9$\times$9 cm$^2$ and 5$\times$8 cm$^2$, respectively. The thickness is 500 micrometer for both the silicon and GaAs sensors. The pad size is about 5$\times$5 mm$^2$. The sensors are foreseen to be used in a compact electromagnetic sampling calorimeter. The readout of the pads is done by metal traces connected to the pads and the front-end ASICs at the edges of the sensors. For the silicon sensors, copper traces on a Kapton foil are connected to the sensor pads with conducting glue. The pads of the GaAs sensors are connected to bond-pads via aluminium traces on the sensor substrate. The readout is based on a dedicated front-end ASIC, called FLAME. Pre-processing of the raw data and deconvolution is performed with FPGAs. The whole system is orchestrated by a Trigger Logic Unit. Results are shown for the signal-to-noise ratio, the homogeneity of the response, edge effects on pads, and for signals due to the readout traces.

Abstract: Accelerating Airy beams, known for their non-diffracting nature, self-healing properties, and curved propagation trajectories, are solutions to the paraxial wave equation. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally investigate nonuniform (radially and azimuthally) polarized vector Airy beams. We provide an analytical representation of their spatial spectra and examine their electromagnetic field distributions in space. To validate the theoretical model, we have used a nanograting inscribed inside a glass volume by a femtosecond laser to create geometrical phase elements, suitable for the realization of high-power ultrafast radially and azimuthally polarized vector Airy beams. We have conducted experiments that confirm the successful generation of high-power vector beams and have performed Stokes parameter measurements of these beams. Additionally, we explore both theoretically and experimentally their topology, identifying particle-like formations such as skyrmionic and antiskyrmionc accelerating lattices within the high-power ultrafast electric fields and their Stokes parameters.

Abstract: Global solar photospheric magnetic maps play a critical role in solar and heliospheric physics research. Routine magnetograph measurements of the field occur only along the Sun-Earth line, leaving the far-side of the Sun unobserved. Surface Flux Transport (SFT) models attempt to mitigate this by modeling the surface evolution of the field. While such models have long been established in the community (with several releasing public full-Sun maps), none are open source. The Open Source Flux Transport (OFT) model seeks to fill this gap by providing an open and user-extensible SFT model that also builds on the knowledge of previous models with updated numerical and data acquisition/assimilation methods along with additional user-defined features. In this first of a series of papers on OFT, we introduce its computational core: the High-performance Flux Transport (HipFT) code (github.com/predsci/hipft). HipFT implements advection, diffusion, and data assimilation in a modular design that supports a variety of flow models and options. It can compute multiple realizations in a single run across model parameters to create ensembles of maps for uncertainty quantification and is high-performance through the use of multi-CPU and multi-GPU parallelism. HipFT is designed to enable users to easily write extensions, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability. We describe HipFT's model features, validations of its numerical methods, performance of its parallel and GPU-accelerated code implementation, analysis/post-processing options, and example use cases.

Abstract: The high-pressure growth technique is a vital approach that facilitates the stabilization of new phases and allows for meticulous control of structural parameters, which significantly impact electronic and magnetic properties. We present a short review of our ongoing investigations into various families of iron-based superconductors (IBS), employing the high-gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. This technique is capable of producing the gas pressures up to 1.8 GPa and a heating temperature of up to 1700 {\deg}C through a three-zone furnace within a cylindrical chamber. Different kinds of IBS samples are prepared using HPHTS and characterized through various measurements to reach the final conclusions. The results demonstrate that the high-pressure growth technique significantly enhances the properties of IBS, including the transition temperature, critical current density, and pinning force. In addition, the quality of the samples and their density are improved through the intergrain connections. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluations and investigations prove that a growth pressure of 0.5 GPa is sufficient for producing high-quality IBS bulks under the optimized synthesis conditions.

Abstract: The achievement of selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond is challenging due to the emergence of competing phases such as its hexagonal polymorph or clathrates possessing similar free energy. Although both polymorphs exhibit a complete photonic bandgap, the cubic diamond exhibits it at lower frequencies than the hexagonal counterpart, positioning him as a promising candidate for photonic applications.Herein, we demonstrate that the 1:1 mixture of identical patchy particles cannot selectively form the cubic diamond polymorph due to the frustrations present in the system that are manifested in the primary adsorption layer and propagate as the film grows. We provide a plausible} explanation why the binary system under confinement, resembling interactions between the complementary DNA bases cannot yield the selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond crystals which is based on the similarities to the antiferromagnetic systems. We always observe the mixture of both hexagonal and cubic diamonds, however, the formation of such stacking hybrids is observed for a wider range of patch sizes compared to the one-component system.

Abstract: Due to traits of CMOS compatibility and scalability, HfO2-based ferroelectrics are promising candidates for next-generation memory devices. However, their commercialization has been greatly hindered by reliability issues, with fatigue being a major impediment. We report the fatigue-free behavior in interface-designed Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based heterostructures. A coherent CeO2-x/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 heterointerface is constructed, wherein CeO2-x acts as an oxygen sponge, capable of reversibly accepting and releasing oxygen vacancies. This design effectively alleviates defect aggregation at the electrode-ferroelectric interface, enabling improved switching characteristics. Further, a symmetric capacitor architecture is designed to minimize the imprint, thereby suppressing the cycling-induced oriented defect drift. The two-pronged technique mitigates oxygen-voltammetry-generated chemical/energy fluctuations, suppressing the formation of paraelectric phase and polarization degradation. The design ensures a fatigue-free feature exceeding 10^11 switching cycles and an endurance lifetime surpassing 10^12 cycles for Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based capacitors, along with excellent temperature stability and retention. These findings pave the way for developing ultra-stable hafnia-based ferroelectric devices.

# Theory of Order-Disorder Phase Transitions Induced by Fluctuations Based on Network Models

**Authors:** Yonglong Ding

arXiv:2501.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic phase transitions are probably induced by fluctuations, yet the specific mechanism through which fluctuations cause phase transitions remains unclear in existing theories. This paper summarizes different phases into combinations of three types of network structures based on lattice models transformed into network models and the principle of maximum entropy. These three network structures correspond to ordered, boundary, and disordered conditions, respectively. By utilizing the transformation relationships satisfied by these three network structures and classical probability, this work derive the high-order detailed balance relationships satisfied by strongly correlated systems. Using the high-order detailed balance formula, this work obtain the weights of the maximum entropy network structures in general cases. Consequently, I clearly describe the process of ordered-disordered phase transitions based on fluctuations and provide critical exponents and phase transition points. Finally, I verify this theory using the Ising model in different dimensions, the frustration scenario of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, and the expectation of ground-state energy in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.

# Observation and modeling of complex transient structure in heliosphere followed by geomagnetic storm on May 10-11, 2024

Abstract: Complex CME/ICME structures in the solar wind often arising in the heliosphere as a result of interaction between two or more CMEs are very important due to their enhanced geoefficiency, but their modeling is difficult due to lack of observational data outside the solar corona. The outstanding evidence of such complex structure occurred on May 10-11,2024, when the strongest geomagnetic storm was caused by a series of successive CMEs emerged from the same solar AR13664. The complex formed from the first 4 CMEs of the series triggered a drop of the Dst-index to -412nT. The aim of this study is to consider propagation of these ICMEs in the heliosphere using observations at three stages: at the starting point observed with the LASCO, in the middle heliosphere by the IPS method and in situ at the L1 point with the ACE. The IPS observations were carried out on May 9 and 10 with the BSA LPI, which enables to build in the scanning mode 2D map of scintillation index m2 associated with enhancements of the integrated over the LOS plasma density over a range of the heliocentric distances 0.4-0.8AU. Evolution of the ICMEs in the heliosphere was described using a cone model in the selfsimilar approximation and kinematics according to the DBM. The initial spatial distributions of density at the cone base were determined from the LASCO images of the CMEs at the heights of 20Rsun, and then were rescaled according to radial distances to the position corresponding to the time of the BSA observations. It was shown that the modeled distribution of the ICME complex LOS density N2 over heliocentric distance is consistent with distribution of m2. Some discrepancies may characterize variation of the density structure inside the complex due to CME interaction. The modeled mean volume density of the ICME plasma at the L1 position agreed with in situ ACE measurements, which validates the developed expansion model.

Abstract: A faster than real time forecast system for solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field transients that is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms is proposed to provide a continuous nowcast of the solar corona ($<0.1$AU) and 24-hours forecast of the solar wind at 1 AU by solving a full 3-D MHD model. This new model has been inspired by the concept of \textit{relativity of simultaneity} used in the theory of special relativity. It is based on time transformation between two coordinate systems: the solar rest frame and a boosted system in which the current observations of the solar magnetic field and tomorrow's measurement of the solar wind at 1 AU are simultaneous. In this paper we derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics (HD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and present a new numerical algorithm that only modifies the conserved quantities but preserves the original HD/MHD numerical flux. The proposed method enables an efficient numerical implementation, and thus a significantly longer forecast time than the traditional method.

Abstract: The directional coupler is a fundamental element of wave-based circuits. The state of the art for the spin-wave directional couplers consists mostly of macroscopic waveguides or two-dimensional planar systems. In this Letter, we present the design of the nanoscale spin-wave vertical directional coupler with a very high efficiency exceeding 99.5%. We demonstrate that the operation of the coupler can be controlled by the magnitude of the external magnetic field. Moreover, it can perform multiplexing and demultiplexing of the spin-wave signal. Such a device ought to become an essential element of the three-dimensional magnonic circuits.

Abstract: Particle beams provided by accelerators occupy a finite volume of the four dimensional transverse phase space. The latter is spanned by the four degrees of freedom, i.e., horizontal/vertical position and momentum. This volume is referred to as emittance. Horizontal and vertical emittances are obtained through projections onto the two transverse sub-phase spaces. Eigen-emittances are obtained from the latter by removing all horizontal-vertical correlations through an appropriate beam optics section. Canonical vorticity flux is used for instance for modelling dynamics of tubes formed by magnetic field lines and particle currents embedded into plasmas. This report is on the relation of eigen-emittances and canonical vorticity flux. Change of beam eigen-emittances is equivalent to change of beam canonical vorticity flux.

Abstract: We demonstrate an all-optical single beam pulsed atomic magnetometer assisted by laser mode-hopping in a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser. We implement a temporal sequence of the laser current, with sinusoidal current modulation including the laser mode-hop current for synchronous optical pumping, and a following constant current for paramagnetic Faraday rotation measurements, to probe the free induction decay (FID) of transverse $^{87}$Rb spin polarization. Repetitive sudden frequency shifts of 20 GHz around the pressure-broadened $^{87}$Rb spectra, originating from laser mode-hopping, enable discontinuous optical pumping modulation with a large depth, which enhances transverse spin polarization. We achieved a sensitivity of 0.6 pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ in a magnetic field of 27 $\mu$T, mainly limited by the photon-shot-noise and the magnetic field noise induced by the current noise in the current supply for driving the bias magnetic field coil. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the sensitivity due to the non-magnetic noise such as photon shot-noise is 131 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$. Our approach based on laser mode-hopping can be applied for the miniaturization of all-optical atomic magnetometers with sub-pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ sensitivities.

Abstract: Free-induction-decay (FID) magnetometers have evolved as simple magnetic sensors for sensitive detection of unknown magnetic fields. However, these magnetometers suffer from a fundamental problem known as a "dead zone," making them insensitive to certain magnetic field directions. Here, we demonstrate a simple experimental scheme for the dead-zone-free operation of a FID atomic magnetometer. Using a single laser beam containing equal strength of linear- and circular-polarization components and amplitude-modulation at a low-duty cycle, we have synchronously pumped the rubidium-87 atoms with both first- and second-order frequency harmonics. Such a pumping scheme has enabled us to observe the free Larmor precession of atomic spins at a frequency of $\Omega_L$ (orientation) and/or 2$\Omega_L$ (alignment) in a single FID signal, depending on the direction of the external magnetic field. We observed that the amplitude of the FID signal does not go to zero for any magnetic field direction, proving the absence of dead zones in the magnetometer. The magnetometer has a sensitivity in the range of 3.2 - 8.4 pT/$\sqrt{Hz}$ in all directions. Our experimental scheme can be crucial in developing miniaturized atomic magnetometers for various practical applications, including geomagnetic applications.

Abstract: Precise spatial manipulation of particles via optical forces is essential in many research areas, ranging from biophysics to atomic physics. Central to this effort is the challenge of designing optical systems that are optimized for specific applications. Traditional design methods often rely on trial-and-error methods, or on models that approximate the particle as a point dipole, which only works for particles much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. In this work, we present a general inverse design framework based on the Maxwell stress tensor formalism capable of simultaneously designing all components of the system, while being applicable to particles of arbitrary sizes and shapes. Notably, we show that with small modifications to the baseline formulation, it is possible to engineer systems capable of attracting, repelling, accelerating, oscillating, and trapping particles. We demonstrate our method using various case studies where we simultaneously design the particle and its environment, with particular focus on free-space particles and particle-metalens systems.

Abstract: 3D additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of nanophotonic structures with subwavelength features that control light across macroscopic scales. Gradient-based optimization offers an efficient approach to design these complex and non-intuitive structures. However, expanding this methodology from 2D to 3D introduces complexities, such as the need for structural integrity and connectivity. This work introduces a multi-objective optimization method to address these challenges in 3D nanophotonic designs. Our method combines electromagnetic simulations with an auxiliary heat-diffusion solver to ensure continuous material and void connectivity. By modeling material regions as heat sources and boundaries as heat sinks, we optimize the structure to minimize the total temperature, thereby penalizing disconnected regions that cannot dissipate thermal loads. Alongside the optical response, this heat metric becomes part of our objective function. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by designing two 3D nanophotonic devices. The first is a focusing element. The second is a waveguide junction, which connects two incoming waveguides for two different wavelengths into two outgoing waveguides, which are rotated by 90{\deg} to the incoming waveguides. Our approach offers a design pipeline that generates digital blueprints for fabricable nanophotonic materials, paving the way for practical 3D nanoprinting applications.

arXiv:2311.10350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re & p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is <10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with & without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes & orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.

Abstract: Dark photons, as a minimal extension of the Standard Model through an additional Abelian gauge group, may propagate relativistically across the galaxy, originating from dark matter decay or annihilation, thereby contributing to a galactic dark photon background. The generation of dark photons typically favors certain polarization modes, which are dependent on the interactions between dark matter and dark photons. We introduce a framework in which a resonant cavity is utilized to detect and differentiate these polarizations, leveraging the daily variation in expected signals due to the anisotropic distribution of dark photons and the rotation of the Earth. We conduct an experimental search using superconducting radio-frequency cavities, noted for their exceptionally high quality factors, proving them to be effective telescopes for observing galactic dark photons. This approach establishes the most stringent limits yet on the kinetic mixing coefficient between dark photons and electromagnetic photons, thereby unveiling a novel avenue for the indirect search for dark matter via multi-messenger astronomy.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions, a significant challenge remains in crafting nontrivial high-order skyrmionic textures with varying, or even tailor-made, topologies. We address this challenge, by focusing on a construction pathway of skyrmionic metamaterials within a monolayer thin film and suggest several skyrmionic metamaterials that are surprisingly stable, i.e., long-lived, due to a self-stabilization mechanism. This makes these new textures promising for applications. Central to our approach is the concept of 'simulated controlled assembly', in short, a protocol inspired by 'click chemistry' that allows for positioning topological magnetic structures where one likes, and then allowing for energy minimization to elucidate the stability. Utilizing high-throughput atomistic-spin-dynamic simulations alongside state-of-the-art AI-driven tools, we have isolated skyrmions (topological charge Q=1), antiskyrmions (Q=-1), and skyrmionium (Q=0). These entities serve as foundational 'skyrmionic building blocks' to form the here reported intricate textures. In this work, two key contributions are introduced to the field of skyrmionic systems. First, we present a a novel combination of atomistic spin dynamics simulations and controlled assembly protocols for the stabilization and investigation of new topological magnets. Second, using the aforementioned methods we report on the discovery of skyrmionic metamaterials.

Abstract: Diamonds with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles are one of the most promising solid-state quantum platforms for various sensing applications. The combination of a long spin dephasing time ($T_2^*$) and a high NV center concentration is crucial for pushing the sensitivity limits. In this work, we propose a systematic measurement approach to quantify the electron spin dephasing in NV center ensembles and analyze the contributions of various sources to the dephasing time, including NV-NV interactions, strain and electric field distributions, $^{13}$C nuclear spins, and P1 electron spins. Our method is validated using a series of high-performance diamond samples, providing a comprehensive understanding of dephasing mechanisms and revealing correlations between NV concentration and different dephasing sources. Based on these insights, we further evaluate and propose strategies to improve the achievable sensitivity limits for DC magnetic field measurements.

π-Conjugated molecules with nontrivial topologies, such as catenanes and knots, offer unique aromaticity and through-space electronic and magnetic interactions absent in traditional planar π-systems. However, their synthesis remains challenging, with prior examples showing only localized aromaticity in individual benzenoid rings. Here, we report the synthesis of a [2]catenane comprising two intertwined octaphyrinoid rings, each with 34 globally delocalized π-electrons, achieved using a passive metal-template strategy with 2,2’-dipyrromethene as the directing ligand. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal nearly orthogonal spatial arrangement of the rings in neutral catenane, stabilized by multiple [NH···N] and [S···N] close contacts. These rings exhibit global aromaticity with entangled magnetic shielding interactions. Upon four-electron oxidation, the system converts to a tetracation with two globally antiaromatic (32π) rings, where through-space bonding interactions minish the antiaromatic destabilization. Notably, counterions also affect (anti)aromaticity of the tetracations in single-crystal state, highlighting a dynamic interplay between molecular topology, electronic structure, and external interactions.

# Melorheostosis affecting contiguous multi-segment thoracic vertebrae resulting in bilateral lower limb paralysis: A case report

## 影响连续多节段胸椎的Melorheostosis导致双侧下肢瘫痪: 一例病例报告

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5777361/latest

Background: Melorheostosis is a non-hereditary, benign, sclerotic bone dysplasia that typically affects a single limb, involving both bones and adjacent soft tissues. It is rare in both clinical and radiological presentations.As the disease rarely involves the spine and exhibits inconspicuous early symptoms, it is frequently overlooked, leading to delayed diagnosis and missed treatment windows. Recently, we successfully diagnosed and managed a patient.
Case presentation: A 30-year-old male presented with a one-year history of progressive numbness and weakness in both lower limbs without obvious cause. Following a full-length X-ray of the lower limbs, a diagnosis of melorheostosis was considered, and conservative drug therapy was initiated. However, his symptoms worsened, progressing to paraplegia.At our hospital, further spine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple signal changes in the thoracic vertebrae, spinal canal stenosis at the T6-T8 levels, and spinal cord degeneration at the corresponding segments.The patient underwent thoracic spinal canal decompression surgery, resulting in significant improvement in the symptoms of both lower limbs postoperatively.
Conclusion: This case suggests that in patients with melorheostosis presenting with neurological symptoms, potential spinal involvement should be considered. Comprehensive spinal examinations and timely diagnosis and treatment are essential for better prognosis.

Background Central neuropathies caused by diabetic nephropathy (DN) share similar characteristics. The present study aimed to analyze the changes in brain function of patients with DN based on the kidney&amp;ndash;brain axis.Methods The study population consisted of patients with DN and healthy controls (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;23 per group). Brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed on all participants, and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) values were calculated. The diagnostic authenticity was assessed through receiver operating characteristic curves using sensitivity, specificity, and Youden index. Statistical analysis included Pearson's correlation between mean fALFF values and DN data.Results The imaging analysis revealed that DN patients exhibited lower fALFF values in the right cingulum anterior segment (RCA) and left cingulum middle segment, and increased fALFF values in the right cingulum middle segment compared to control subjects. The correlation analysis demonstrated that mean fALFF values in the RCA correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate in DN patients.Conclusions The research findings demonstrated significant differences in fALFF values in the default mode network and visual cortex-related areas. These observations may be highly valuable for understanding the kidney&amp;ndash;brain axis mechanisms of DN, as well as the associations between diabetic microvascular complications.

# 12th Rib Length as a Predictor of Anatomical Variations in the Lumbosacral Plexus Associated with Atypical Radiculopathy in Lumbar Disc Herniation

## 12肋骨长度可作为腰椎间盘突出症非典型神经根病相关腰骶丛解剖变异的预测指标

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5812659/latest

Study Design: A combined clinical and cadaveric observational study.
Objectives: To investigate whether anatomical variations in the lumbosacral plexus (LSP) are associated with diagnostic discrepancies in lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and to corroborate clinical findings with anatomical evidence.
Summary of Background Data: LDH is typically diagnosed based on clinical neurological symptoms and the level of the compressed spinal nerve root (the responsible lesion) identified by magnetic resonance imaging. However, in some patients, radiculopathy symptoms do not always align with the responsible lesion, complicating the diagnosis. This discrepancy may be linked to anatomical variations in the LSP, although the exact cause remains unclear. LSP roots may exhibit cranio-caudal deviations, which tends to be associated with shorter or longer 12th ribs, providing a potential basis for investigation.
Methods: We examined 12th rib length in 144 patients with LDH at Juntendo University Hospital and investigated the relationship between LSP branch deviations and 12th rib length in 29 Japanese cadavers, donated to Juntendo University School of Medicine.
Results: Of the total, 102 cases showed matching radiculopathies and responsible lesions (matched group), while 42 cases exhibited discrepancies (mismatched group). The mismatched group was subdivided into: 19 cases with radiculopathy at a lower level than predicted by the responsible lesion (lower-level radiculopathy type) and 23 cases with radiculopathy at a higher level (higher-level radiculopathy). These types were significantly associated with shorter and longer 12th ribs, respectively, suggesting cranial and caudal deviations in LSP branches, confirmed by anatomical examination.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that contradictory neurological symptoms in LDH may be largely due to cranio-caudal deviations in the LSP and its branches. Furthermore, the 12th rib length may help predict these anatomical variations, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy in LDH.

# Unusual presentation of Lewis-Sumner Syndrome in elderly

## 老年人lewis-sumner综合征的异常表现

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5706040/latest

Lewis-Sumner Syndrome (LSS) is a rare disease that affect usually young adult. It is characterized by a proximal and especially distal myalgia, asymmetric muscle weakness, which mostly affects the upper limbs with early onset. Diagnosis can be difficult to establish if the clinical presentation is atypical. We report here a rare case of LSS in an old patient with unusual clinical aspects. A 70-year-old female patient with a history of atrial fibrillation complicated by pulmonary embolism, presented with myalgia and muscle weakness of the shoulders, upper arms, hips and thighs. This involvement was bilateral, symmetrical and evolving for 3 months, causing difficulties in climbing stairs, standing or walking. Physical examination showed a proximal muscle deficiency affecting proximal muscles of the upper and lower limbs. In this stage, we suspected an inflammatory myopathy or polymyalgia rheumatica. Biological investigation showed an inflammatory syndrome and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level. The immunoblot polymyositis profile was negative. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of hips revealed a signal abnormality in the gluteus medius muscles on both sides with inflammatory appearance. The Electromyography revealed sensorimotor neuropathy affecting the four limbs more pronounced in lower ones, with motor nerve conduction blocks. The cerebrospinal fluid study revealed a proteinorachia at 0.4g/l with normal glycorachia and normal cell counts. These results confirmed the diagnosis of LSS. The patient was treated by corticosteroids at dose of 1 mg/ kg/ day during 2 months, with a progressive decrease of treatment. The evolution was marked by spectacular clinical and biological relief.

# A Low-intensity Rim on T2-weighted Brainstem Imaging is a Normal Finding and a Mimicker of Superficial Siderosis

## T2-weighted脑干成像上的低强度边缘是正常发现，并且是浅表含线病的模仿者。

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5695756/latest

Purpose: In healthy participants, T2 superficial localized low intensity (T2-SLL) similar to superficial siderosis has been observed in the brainstem. This study aimed to determine the incidence and causes of T2-SLL.
Methods: To determine the incidence, T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) was performed on 114 patients (68 males; mean age: 59.1 years) using a 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner and visually assessed by two radiologists. T2-SLL presence in 22 brain areas was evaluated using the following system: 0 for absence, 1 for &amp;lt;50% surface, 2 for &ge;50% but not the entirety, and 3 for the entirety. After assessing inter-rater agreement, the scores were averaged. To investigate the causes of T2-SLL, an experimental MR imaging (MRI) was performed on a healthy male volunteer. To evaluate the chemical shift effect, the bandwidth and encoding direction were modified. To assess the magnetic susceptibility effect, T2*WI was performed using varying echo times (TEs).
Results: A moderate inter-rater score agreement (&kappa;=0.556) was observed. T2-SLL was identified in all participants and was most frequently observed on the frontal and lateral sides of the midbrain and pons, with the highest occurrence on the frontal of the upper pons (median 2.0; interquartile range 2.0&ndash;3.0). In the experimental MRI, no differences in T2-SLL were observed across the varying bandwidths and encoding directions. However, the superficial low signal for T2WI thickened as the TE lengthened, similar to blood vessels, suggesting a magnetic susceptibility effect.
Conclusion: T2-SLL can be regarded as a normal structure that may be associated with blood vessels.
