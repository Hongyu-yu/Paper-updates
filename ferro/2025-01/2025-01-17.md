A team of researchers has discovered a new way to control the magnetic behavior of quantum materials using applied voltages. Specifically, the material lanthanum strontium manganite (LSMO), which is magnetic and metallic at low temperatures but non-magnetic and insulating when relatively warm, can be influenced by voltage.

Observing the effects of special relativity doesn't necessarily require objects moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. In fact, length contraction in special relativity explains how electromagnets work. A magnetic field is just an electric field seen from a different frame of reference.

Abstract: Atomically thin layered materials are systems with zero limit bulk-to-surface ratio. Their physical properties are determined by two-dimensionality and strongly affected by interfacing with other systems. Therefore, they represent an accessible platform for the abundance of quantum effects that can be engineered by combining them into vertical stacks. Two types of layered systems are considered here - artificially prepared (exfoliated) van der Waals nanostructures, and naturally layered systems showing quasi 2D behaviour already in a bulk form. A special class of naturally layered materials is misfit structures combining atomic layers of hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides and slabs of tetragonal ionic rare-earth monochalcogenides in the same superlattice. Both types of layered systems feature a new state of quantum matter, the Ising superconductivity extremely resilient to external magnetic field. A giant electron doping, natural to the misfit structures, can lead to topological superconductivity. Both systems can also be assembled into heterostructures combining different constituents. Layered 2D heterostructures have a large number of implications for many potential applications in solid-state devices.

Abstract: At temperatures much lower than its superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 2.1 K, the heavy fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ has a remarkable phase diagram of magnetic field $H$ vs. angles $\phi$ and $\theta$ at which $H$ is tilted away from the $b$-axis toward the $a$- and $c$-axes, respectively, in the orthorhombic unit cell. The phase diagram appears to contain three superconducting phases: (1) a low field superconducting phase SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extending over all values of $\phi$ and $\theta$ with an upper critical field $H_{c2}$ with a maximum value of 15 T at $\phi = \theta = 0^\circ$; (2) a high field superconducting phase SC$_{\mathrm{HF}}$ located in a region between $\phi \approx 7^\circ$ and $\theta \approx 4^\circ$ in fields from $H_{c2\mathrm{LF}}$ of the SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ phase and the metamagnetic transition at $H_m$ at $\sim 35$ T marking the onset of the magnetic field polarized FP phase: and (3) a SC$_{\mathrm{FP}}$ superconducting phase that resides entirely within the FP phase in a pocket of superconductivity extending from $\theta \approx 20^\circ$ to $40^\circ$ in fields from $\sim 40$ T to above 60 T. In this work, we studied the $H$ vs $\theta$ phase diagram at a base temperature of $\sim 0.6$ K as a function of Th concentration $x$ in U$_{1-x}$Th$_x$Te$_2$ pseudobinary compounds for $0.5\% \lesssim x \lesssim 4.7\%$. We find that for all values of $x$ within this range, the SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ phase is retained with a reduced value of $H_{c2}$ of $\sim 10$ T at $\phi = \theta = 0^\circ$ for $x = 4.7\%$, while the SC$_{\mathrm{HF}}$ phase is suppressed. The SC$_{\mathrm{FP}}$ and FP phases are unaffected to values of $x = 2\%$ but are completely suppressed in the region $x = 2.5$ to $4.7\%$ where the residual resistance ratio RRR has decreased from $\sim 14$ at $x = 1.5\%$ to values of $\sim 3$, indicating a significant increase in disorder.

arXiv:2501.08564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding environmental effects in a topological Josephson junction is vital for identifying signatures of Majorana modes. We consider a planar Josephson junction formed on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, which possesses Majorana modes inside the junction and boundary modes outside. We find that tunneling between the inner and outer modes gives rise to effective coupling between the inner Majorana modes, and hence induces energy splitting of their states even in the absence of the direct spatial overlap of their wave functions. The energy splitting is obtained analytically in the weak tunneling limit and is numerically investigated for an arbitrary tunneling strength. We discuss in detail the evolution of the energy splitting with an external perpendicular magnetic field and its effect on the shape of the Fraunhofer pattern.

arXiv:2501.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron pairing along with phase coherence generates superconductivity below the critical temperature ($T_c$). In underdoped high-$T_c$ cuprates, these two quantum phenomena may occur at separate temperatures, which was lately confirmed in the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) iron chalcogenide superconductors. Here, we report a systematic investigation on the pre-pairing behavior in a triclinic iron pnictide superconductor (Ca$_{0.85}$La$_{0.15}$)$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)(Fe$_2$As$_2$)$_5$ with $T_c \approx $ 30 K, where the superconductivity is quasi-2D manifested by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless behaviors. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments unambiguously reveal a spin resonance peak around $E_R =$ 13 meV in the superconducting state, but its intensity continuously decreases when warming up across $T_c$, accompanied with an anomaly around $T^{*}\approx$ 45 K in spin correlations, and a suppression by an in-plane magnetic field persisting to the same temperature. Below $T^{*}$, a significant Nernst signal and a reduction of density of states at the Fermi level are also observed. These results suggest that the precursor of spin resonance is highly related to the preformed Cooper pairs driven by phase fluctuations, much like the pseudogap case in cuprates.

Abstract: Interfaces play a substantial role for the properties function structured magnetic materials and magnetic multilayers. Modeling the functional behavior of magnetic materials requires treatment of the relevant phenomena at the device level. Properties that arise from the electronic structure and spin dynamics at the atomistic level have to be properly transferred into a continuum level treatment. In this work we show how Co/Ru/Co three layers can be simulated with the continuum theory of micromagnetism, if interface coupling energies and bulk intrinsic properties are derived from the results of ab-initio and spin dynamics simulations at different temperatures.

arXiv:2501.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic/semiconductor heterojunctions represent an ideal platform for studying and exploiting tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effects due to the versatile band structure of semiconductors and their high-quality interfaces. In the all-vdW magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices, both the magnitude and sign of the TMR can be tuned by an applied voltage. Typically, as the bias voltage increases, first the amplitude of the TMR decreases, then the sign of the TMR reverses and/or oscillates. Here, we report on an unconventional bias-dependent TMR in the all-vdW Fe3GaTe2/GaSe/Fe3GaTe2 MTJs, where the TMR first increases, then decreases, and finally undergoes a sign reversal as the bias voltage increases. This dependence cannot be explained by traditional models of MTJs. We propose an in-plane electron momentum (k//) resolved tunneling model that considers both the coherent degree of k// and the decay of the electron wave function through the semiconductor spacer layer. This can explain well the conventional and unconventional bias-dependent TMR. Our results thus provide a deeper understanding of the bias-dependent spin-transport in semiconductor-based MTJs and offer new insights into semiconductor spintronics.

arXiv:2501.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new class of algebraic spin liquids, in which the macroscopically degenerate ground state manifold is not Coulombic, like in spin ices, but Amp\`ere-like. The local constraint characterizing an Amp\`ere phase is not a Gauss law, but rather an Amp\`ere law, i.e., a condition on the curl of the magnetization vector field and not on its divergence. As a consequence, the excitations evolving in such a manifold are not magnetically charged scalar quasiparticles, the so-called magnetic monopoles in Coulomb phases, but instead vectorial magnetic loops (or fictional current lines). We demonstrate analytically that in a macroscopically degenerate manifold inheriting the properties of a cooperative paramagnet and subject to a local curl-free contraint, magnetic correlations decay in space with a power law whose exponent is the space dimension d: the Amp\`ere phase is a d-algebraic spin liquid. Using Monte Carlo simulations with appropriate cluster dynamics, we confirm this physics numerically in two- and three-dimensional examples, and illustrate how the Amp\`ere phase compares to its Coulomb counterpart.

Abstract: Ising superconductivity allows in-plane upper critical magnetic fields to vastly surpass Pauli limit by locking the antiparallel electron spins of Cooper pairs in the out-of-plane direction. It was first explicitly demonstrated in fully two-dimensional monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides with large spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry. Since then, several studies have shown that it can be present in layered bulk materials, too. In our previous study, we have clarified the underlying microscopic mechanism of Ising superconductivity in bulk, based on a reduced electronic coupling between superconducting layers due to intercalation by insulating layers and restricted inversion symmetry. But earlier studies suggest that in some transition metal dichalcogenide polytypes Pauli paramagnetic limit is violated even without intercalation. Here, using heat capacity measurements we unambiguously demonstrate, that the pristine noncentrosymmetric bulk 4Ha-NbSe2 polytype significantly violates the Pauli limit. The band structure parameters obtained from ab initio calculations using the experimentally determined crystal structure are used in the theoretical model which provides the microscopic mechanism of the Ising protection based solely on broken inversion symmetry.

Abstract: We experimentally study nonlinear generation of the second harmonic by backward volume spin waves propagating in microscopic magnonic waveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator with a thickness of several tens of nanometers. We show that highly efficient resonant second harmonic generation is possible in the inter-mode regime at microwave powers of the order of 10^-4 W. In contrast to previously observed second harmonic generation processes, the generation by backward waves is characterized by the nonlinearly generated waves propagating opposite to the initial waves, and can be realized at zero bias magnetic field.

Abstract: Hydrogen incorporation into iron interstitial sites under high-pressure conditions forms stoichiometric iron monohydride (FeH) with a double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) structure. This structure is stable over a broad pressure-temperature range, where ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur. In this study, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we identified negative thermal expansion and thermally invariant volume behavior in dhcp-FeH. Our findings, supported by DFT+DMFT calculations, reveal that these thermal effects are governed by magnetic transitions. The Curie temperature decreases linearly with pressure at a rate of about -21 K/GPa, reaching 300 K at 28 GPa. Experimentally measured magnetostriction is an order of magnitude smaller than prior theoretical predictions, possibly due to volume expansion induced by hydrogen incorporation.

Abstract: Co25Fe75 ferromagnetic films exhibit ultralow magnetic damping. The magnetic damping dependence of Cobalt Iron thin films over a Co composition (23 to 36%) is here reported. The thin film structures were sputter deposited at ambient temperature and FMR measurements in both in plane and out of plane geometries were utilized to measure magnetic damping parameters, which include intrinsic damping and contributions from spin pumping. The damping parameters, decrease as the Co content is increased, except for Co31Fe69. The smallest values of damping correspond to alloys exhibiting interface perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. A value of 0.00091 was measured for Co36Fe64, whereas for Co31Fe69 was measured as 0.002, this composition exhibits the largest in-plane anisotropy. HAADF-STEM cross-section analysis of the Co36Fe64 thin film stack revealed Cu interdiffusion into the magnetic layer. The degree of interdiffusion was found to be up to 7x higher at grain boundaries as compared the bulk of the polycrystalline grains. The incorporation of Cu into the ferromagnetic layer adversely impacts magnetic damping. Reducing impurities in the magnetic layer by improving the growth chamber base pressure resulted in a reduction of magnetic damping of 18%. The diffraction analysis revealed that the primary growth direction of Co36Fe64 is [101] and that of Cu buffer layer is [111], these planes are perpendicular to their respective [101] planes and for this composition the lattice mismatch was determined to be 0.9325%. The lattice mismatch decreases with increasing Co content and hence the lattice strain. The diffusion of Cu into the ferromagnet creates magnon scattering centers and local changes in magnetic properties. Both factors negatively influence magnetic damping.

Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals are a class of topological materials hosting one dimensional lines of band degeneracy. Kramers nodal-line (KNL) metals/semimetals have recently been theoretically recognized as a class of topological states inherent to all non-centrosymmetric achiral crystal lattices. We investigate the electronic structure of candidate KNL semimetal YAuGe by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillations as well as by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT has revealed that YAuGe hosts KNLs on the G-A-L-M plane of the Brillouin zone, that are protected by the time reversal and mirror-inversion symmetries. Through ARPES and quantum oscillations we identify signatures of hole bands enclosing the G point, and the observed splitting of quantum oscillation frequency with angle is attributed to spin-orbit-coupling-induced band splitting away from the KNLs. Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the nodal lines along the G-A line is lifted by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking when the Y is substituted by magnetic R ions (R = rare earth). This becomes a source of Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic RAuGe. These findings establish RAuGe as a new class of KNL semimetals offering significant potential for engineering of anomalous magnetotransport properties via magnetic rare-earth substitution.

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) model by including next-nearest-neighbour(NNN) interaction and balanced loss-gain(BLG), and subjecting the whole system to an external uniform magnetic field. We study the band structure, edge states and persistent current in this extended SSH model under General Boundary Condition(GBC) of which the periodic and open boundary conditions appear as special cases. It is shown that the point band gap decreases with the increasing value of the strength of the NNN interaction and vanish beyond a critical value. Further, the line gap exhibits closed-loop like structures for non-vanishing NNN interaction under the Periodic Boundary Condition(PBC). We show that the NNN interaction has no effect on the persistent current in the half-filled limit for the case of PBC, while for other fillings less than the half-filling, it enhances the magnitude of the current significantly. We numerically study the variation of the persistent current with respect to the system parameters under the GBC, for the case the Hamiltonian admits entirely real spectra. We obtain analytic expressions for the edge states in the case of Open Boundary Condition(OBC) for vanishing NNN interaction.We show numerically for OBC that edge states in the topologically trivial phase appear for non vanishing NNN interaction only when the strength of the loss-gain term is greater than the modulus of the difference between the intercell and intracell hopping strengths. In the topologically non-trivial phase, the edge states under OBC exists only up to a critical value of the NNN strength and vanishes beyond this critical value. We show that the NNN interaction, the loss-gain and the boundary terms play a crucial role in the creation and destruction of edge states for the GBC.

Abstract: We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.

Abstract: Introducing a controlled and strong anharmonicity in mechanical systems is a present challenge of nanomechanics. In cavity optomechanics a mechanical oscillator may be made anharmonic by ponderomotively coupling its motion to the light field of a laser-driven cavity. In the regime where the mechanical resonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared to the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a high-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly non-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead to a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator. We present a theory that predicts the measurable signatures left by the mechanical anharmonicity. In particular, we obtain analytically and numerically the mechanical displacement spectrum, and explore the imprints of the mechanical anharmonicity on the cavity light field.

Abstract: We propose that geometric curvature and torsion may be used to probe the quality of an uncompensated antiferromagnetic interface, using the proximity effect. We study a helix of antiferromagnetic wire coupled to a conventional superconductor, and show that a density of states measurement can give information about the quality of an uncompensated interface, crucial for many recently predicted antiferromagnetic proximity effects. Furthermore, we show that geometric curvature alone can result in long-ranged superconducting triplet correlations in the antiferromagnet, and we discuss the impact curvature and torsion can have on the future development of superconducting spintronic devices.

Abstract: A unique feature of non-Hermitian systems is the extreme sensitivity of the eigenspectrum to boundary conditions with the emergence of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). A NHSE originates from the point-gap topology of complex eigenspectrum, where an extensive number of eigenstates are anomalously localized at the boundary driven by nonreciprocal dissipation. Two different approaches to create localization are disorder and flat-band spectrum, and their interplay can lead to the anomalous inverse Anderson localization, where the Bernoulli anti-symmetric disorder induce mobility in a full-flat band system in the presence of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) Cage. In this work, we study the localization-delocalization transitions due to the interplay of the point-gap topology, flat band and correlated disorder in the one-dimensional rhombic lattice, where both its Hermitian and non-Hermitian structures show AB cage in the presence of magnetic flux. Although it remains the coexistence of localization and delocalization for the Hermitian rhombic lattice in the presence of the random anti-symmetric disorder, it surprisingly becomes complete delocalization, accompanied by the emergence of NHSE. To further study the effects from the Bernoulli anti-symmetric disorder, we found the similar NHSE due to the interplay of the point-gap topology, correlated disorder and flat bands. Our anomalous localization-delocalization property can be experimentally tested in the classical physical platform, such as electrical circuit.

Abstract: Non-linear transport effects in response to external magnetic fields, i.e. electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), have attracted much attention for their importance to study quantum and spin-related phenomena. Indeed, they have permitted the exploration of topological surface states and charge-to-spin conversion processes in low-symmetry systems. Nevertheless, despite the inherent correlation between the symmetry of the material under examination and its non-linear transport characteristics, there is a lack of experimental demonstration to delve into this relationship and to unveil their microscopic mechanisms. Here, we study eMChA in chiral elemental Tellurium (Te) along different crystallographic directions, establishing the connection between the different eMChA components and the crystal symmetry of Te. We observed different longitudinal eMChA components with collinear current and magnetic field, demonstrating experimentally the radial angular momentum texture of Te. We also measured a transverse non-linear resistance which, as the longitudinal counterpart, scales bilinearly with current and magnetic fields, illustrating that they are different manifestations of the same effect. Finally, we study the scaling law of the eMChA, evidencing that extrinsic scattering from dynamic sources is the dominant microscopic mechanism. These findings underscore the efficacy of symmetry-based investigations in understanding and predicting non-linear transport phenomena, with potential applications in spintronics and energy harvesting.

Abstract: Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wave functions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG), in contrast, magnetism-manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavors[1-7]-originates from itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here, we show experimentally that the electronic entropy in this system shows signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments, unexpected for electrons in a fully itinerant metal. Specifically, we find a contribution $\Delta$ S $\approx$ 1k$_B$/charge carrier that onsets at the Curie temperature and survives over one order of magnitude in temperature. First order phase transitions show an isospin `Pomeranchuk effect' in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favored over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid[8, 9]. Our results imply that despite the itinerant nature of the electron wave functions, the spin- and valley polarization of individual electrons are decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He[10]. Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite temperature resistance minimum within the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two-dimensional flat band systems.

Abstract: Electric polarization typically originates from non-centrosymmetric charge distributions in compounds. In elemental crystalline materials, chemical bonds between atoms of the same element favor symmetrically distributed electron charges and centrosymmetric structures, making elemental ferroelectrics rare. Compared to atoms, elemental clusters are intrinsically less symmetric and can have various preferred orientations when they are assembled to form crystals. Consequently, the assembly of clusters with different orientations tends to break the inversion symmetry. By exploiting this concept, we show that sliding ferroelectricity naturally emerges in trilayer quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) C$_{60}$, a cluster-assembled carbon allotrope recently synthesized. Compared to many metallic or semi-metallic elemental ferroelectrics, trilayer qHP C$_{60}$'s have sizable band gaps and several ferroelectric structures, which are distinguishable by measuring their second-harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Some of these phases show both switchable out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations on the order of 0.2 pC/m. The out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations can be switched independently and enable an easy-to-implement construction of Van der Waals homostructures with ferroelectrically switchable chirality.

Abstract: We numerically study orders of planer type $(xy,x^2-y^2)$ quadrupoles on a triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor isotropic $J$ and anisotropic $K$ interactions. This type of quadrupoles possesses unique single-ion anisotropy proportional to a third order of the quadrupole moments. This provides an unconventional mechanism of triple-$q$ orders which does not exist for the degrees of freedom with odd parity under time-reversal operation such as magnetic dipoles. In addition to several single-$q$ orders, we find various orders including incommensurate triple-$q$ quasi-long-range orders with orbital moir\'e and a four-sublattice triple-$q$ partial order. Our Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that the phase transition to the latter triple-$q$ state belongs to the universality class of the critical line of the Ashkin-Teller model in two dimensions close to the four-state Potts class. These results indicate a possibility of realizing unique quadrupole textures in simple triangular systems.

Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.

Abstract: Sodium niobate, a lead-free ferroic material, hosts delicately-balanced, competing order parameters, including ferroelectric states that can be stabilized by epitaxial strain. Here, we show that the resulting macroscopic ferroelectricity exhibits an unconventional microscopic structure using multislice electron ptychography. This technique overcomes multiple scattering artifacts limiting conventional electron microscopy, enabling both lateral spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit and recovery of three-dimensional structural information. These imaging capabilities allow us to separate the ferroelectric interior of the sample from the relaxed surface structure and identify the soft phonon mode and related structural distortions with picometer precision. Unlike conventional ferroelectric perovskites, we find that the polar distortion in this material involves minimal distortions of the cation sublattices and is instead dominated by anion displacements relative to the niobium sublattice. We establish limits on film thickness for interfacial octahedral rotation engineering and directly visualize a random octahedral rotation pattern, arising from the flat dispersion of the associated phonon mode.

Abstract: Topological magnons emerge as topologically protected spin wave states at the edges of magnets. Here, we theoretically explore how these surface states can be harnessed to amplify the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in antiferromagnets (AFMs) interfaced with normal metals (NMs). Based on a microscopic model of a kagome AFM, we demonstrate that broken mirror symmetry, combined with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), drives the system into a topological phase hosting spin-polarized magnons at the boundaries. Notably, linear response calculations reveal that in AFM/NM heterostructures, the topological magnons exhibit strong coupling to the metal's charge carriers, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the SSE. The relative contribution of the topological magnons is found to be 4-5 times greater than that of the trivial magnon bands. Moreover, our results show that this enhancement is highly sensitive to the strength of the DMI.

Abstract: Among the most significant macroscopic quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics is the Meissner effect observed in superconductivity, which arises from the unique interaction between superfluids of charged particles and electromagnetic fields. However, superfluids can also emerge from particles possessing distinct electromagnetic properties. In particular, there has been growing interest in superfluids composed of charge-neutral particles with magnetic or electric dipole moments, such as Bose-Einstein condensates of magnons or excitons. Despite this interest, the electromagnetic response of dipole superfluids, including potential analogs or contrasts to the Meissner effect, remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a Ginzburg-Landau phenomenological theory to describe magnetic and electric dipole superfluids subjected to pseudo-magnetic fields induced by geometric phases. For magnetic dipole superfluids interacting with the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase, we find that they form vortex lattices with sharply localized pseudo-magnetic fields along hexagonal domain walls, leading to singular and discontinuous change of physical variables at these boundaries. For electric dipole superfluids influenced by the He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) phase, in contrast, we identify vortex lattices where the pseudo-magnetic field and supercurrent are concentrated at vortex cores, resembling superconductors. These results reveal strikingly different electromagnetic responses in dipole superfluids, opening new directions for exploring superfluid systems with unconventional electromagnetic responses.

Abstract: Skyrmions are stable topological textures that have garnered substantial attention within the ferroelectric community for their exotic functional properties. While previous studies have questioned the feasibility of [001]$_{\text{pc}}$ skyrmion tubes in rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ due to the high energy cost of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, we demonstrate here their stabilization with topological charges of $\mathcal{Q} = \pm 1$ from density functional theory and second-principles calculations. By enabling extensive vortex and antivortex polarization configurations, the expected prohibitive energetic barriers are overcomed while preserving the topological nature of the structures. Notably, we extend these findings to demonstrate the appearance of skyrmion and antiskyrmion tubes in other related materials, highlighting their broader relevance. Furthermore, our computational experiments indicate that these structures can be directly stabilized and reversibly switched by applied electric fields, establishing a straightforward route for their practical realization and functional control in nanoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Since its discovery, graphene has been one of the most prominent 2D materials due to its unique properties and broad range of possible applications. In particular, the half-integer Quantum Hall Effect (HI-QHE) characterized by the quantization of Hall resistivity as a function of applied magnetic field, offers opportunities for advancements in quantum metrology and the understanding of topological quantum states in this 2D material. While the role of disorder in stabilizing quantum Hall plateaus (QHPs) is widely recognized, the precise interplay between the plateaus width, disorder, mobility and carrier density remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the width of the $\nu=6$ QHP in epitaxial graphene Hall bars, focusing on two distinct regions of the device with markedly different electronic mobilities. Depending on the storage conditions, it is possible to modify the carrier density of graphene QHE devices and consequently increase or reduce the mobility. Our experiments reveal mobility variations of up to 200$\%$ from their initial value. In particular, the sample storage time and ambient conditions cause also noticeable changes in the positions and extension of the QHPs. Our results show that the QHP extension for $\nu=6$ differs significantly between the two regions, influenced by both mobility and disorder, rather than solely by carrier density. Transport simulations based on the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism with Anderson disorder in a scaled model reveal the critical role of impurities in shaping graphene transport properties defining the extension of the QHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay between mobility, disorder, and quantum transport in graphene systems.

Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.

Abstract: Light-actuation enables non-contact, precise, and flexible manipulation of liquids in microfluidics and liquid robots. However, it has long been a challenge to achieve optical rotation of liquid on a horizontal substrate because of the weak force of light. Here, we report, for the first time, the laser-induced rotation of macroscopic liquid placed on a horizontal substrate above cylindrical magnets. The investigated ferrofluid exhibits multiple spikes due to the Rosensweig phenomenon on the surface with different strengths of external magnetic field and rotates in a controllable direction by adjusting the laser beam position around ferrofluid spikes. This rotation results from the laser-induced displacement between the ferrofluid gravitational center, magnetic field center, Marangoni force, and non-uniform thermomagnetic force. Movement tracking of the spikes, thermal magnetization, and thermal imaging of ferrofluid were performed to elucidate the mechanism. Additionally, the influence of laser power, laser irradiation position, and magnetic field intensity on laser-induced rotation of ferrofluid are systematically studied. This work demonstrates a novel horizontal rotation of liquid using light and provides a deep understanding of the underlying mechanism and a flexible strategy for manipulating liquid for various optofluidic applications.

Abstract: We explore a hybrid technique to quantify the variability in the numerical solutions to a free boundary problem associated with magnetic equilibrium in axisymmetric fusion reactors amidst parameter uncertainties. The method aims at reducing computational costs by integrating a surrogate model into a multilevel Monte Carlo method. The resulting surrogate-enhanced multilevel Monte Carlo methods reduce the cost of simulation by factors as large as $10^4$ compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations involving direct numerical solutions of the associated Grad-Shafranov partial differential equation. Accuracy assessments also show that surrogate-based sampling closely aligns with the results of direct computation, confirming its effectiveness in capturing the behavior of plasma boundary and geometric descriptors.

Abstract: This study introduces chromatic calorimetry, a novel particle detection method that uses strategically layered scintillators with different emission wavelengths. This approach aims to enhance energy measurement by capturing particle interactions at different shower depths through wavelength-based discrimination. Our experimental validation of this novel method utilizes an arrangement of scintillator materials to improve energy resolution and particle identification. The stacking arrangement of scintillators is organized by their emission wavelengths to track the development of electromagnetic and hadronic showers. By testing electrons and pions with energies up to 100 GeV, the setup demonstrated better discrimination and provided detailed measurements of shower profiles. The results indicate that our experimental validation significantly aims to enhance particle identification and energy resolution, highlighting its potential value in high-energy particle detection. Future work will explore the integration of Quantum Dots (QD) technology to advance these capabilities in chromatic calorimetry further.

# Topologically protected edge states in time photonic crystals with chiral symmetry

Abstract: Time photonic crystals are media in which their electromagnetic parameters are modulated periodically in time, showing promising applications in non-resonant lasers and particle accelerators, among others. Traditionally utilized to study space photonic crystals, topological band theory has also been translated recently to analyze time photonic crystals with time inversion symmetry, enabling the construction of the temporal version of topological edge states. However, temporal disorder can readily break time inversion symmetry in practice, hence likely destroying the edge states associated with this type of time photonic crystals. To overcome this limitation, here we propose a new class of time photonic crystals presenting chiral symmetry instead, whose edge states exhibit superior robustness over the time-reversal-symmetry-protected counterparts. Our time photonic crystal is equivalent to a temporal version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and the chiral symmetry of this type of time photonic crystals quantizes the winding number defined in the Bloch frequency band. Remarkably, random temporal disorders do not impact the eigenfrequencies of these chiral-symmetry-protected edge states, while instead enhancing their temporal localizations. Our findings thus provide a promising paradigm to control field amplification with exceptional robustness as well as being a feasible platform to investigate various topological phases in time-varying media.

Abstract: The recently upgraded DMC diffractometer at SINQ, equipped with a state-of-the-art 2D He detector, enables high-resolution neutron diffraction experiments optimized for both powder and single-crystal studies. To address the increased complexity and volume of data produced by this instrument, we developed DMCPy, a Python-based software package tailored specifically for DMC data analysis. DMCPy facilitates seamless data reduction and visualization, supporting conversion to reciprocal space, normalization, and masking of detector artifacts. Its modular architecture integrates tools for analyzing both powder diffraction patterns and single-crystal datasets, including advanced visualization features like 3D reciprocal space mapping and interactive scan inspection. By streamlining workflows and enhancing data interpretation, DMCPy empowers researchers to unlock the full potential of the DMC instrument for probing nuclear and magnetic structures in condensed matter systems.

# Helicity effect on turbulent passive and active scalar diffusivities

arXiv:2501.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are known to produce enhanced effective magnetic and passive scalar diffusivities, which can fairly accurately be determined with numerical methods. It is now known that, if the flow is also helical, the effective magnetic diffusivity is reduced relative to the nonhelical value. Neither the usual second-order correlation approximation nor the various $\tau$ approaches have been able to capture this. Here we show that the helicity effect on the turbulent passive scalar diffusivity works in the opposite sense and leads to an enhancement. This effect has not previously been seen. We have also demonstrated that the correlation time of the turbulent velocity field increases by the kinetic helicity. This is a key point in the theoretical interpretation of the obtained numerical results. Simulations in which helicity is being produced self-consistently by stratified rotating turbulence, resulted in a turbulent passive scalar diffusivity that was found to be decreasing with increasing rotation rate.

arXiv:2501.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on compact, gaseous 3He NMR probes for precision magnetometry of magnetic fields B > 0.1 T in the temperature range from ambient temperatures down to 4 Kelvin. The gas is polarized at thermal equilibrium under pressures up to 100 bar to provide a high nuclear spin density. In order to achieve sensor readout rates of order (Hz), paramagnetic substances and/or silica gel with high specific surface area were added to reduce the otherwise long T1 relaxation time of pure 3He gas to reach thermal polarization equilibrium. Sensitivity limits, which cover the range from 10-11 < dB/B < 10-7, are sccessible in a single-pulse NMR measurement and can be further improved through signal averaging in accumulated NMR scans.

Abstract: Aims. To investigate the magnetic field geometry and waves in the region near the Sun where the heliospheric current sheet is formed. Methods. One good example of apparent open and closed field lines was found and its fields and plasmas were analyzed. Results. The radial component of the magnetic field (the Z-component) measured on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) changed sign between 12:00 and 13:00 UT on March 30, 2024, when the spacecraft was at 13 solar radii. This sign change may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed the heliospheric current sheet on long open magnetic field lines or it may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed from one side of the equator to the other on much shorter closed magnetic field lines. During this crossing, two distinct regions having different magnetic field geometries, strahl flows, plasma densities, and electric field spectra were observed and identified as regions with open and closed magnetic field lines, respectively. The two regions intermingled on time scales less than 100 milliseconds to create a complex magnetic field geometry. The waves observed in both regions were electrostatic and composed of wide band signatures (in the open field lines regions) and well-structured frequency harmonics (in both the open and closed field lines regions). These harmonic frequencies correlated with the proton plasma frequency, fpp, with the lowest frequency at ~0.1fpp. This result plus the field aligned electric field perturbations and plasma density fluctuations, require that the observed intense electrostatic mode and associated harmonics were ion acoustic waves. The absence of broadband electrostatic signals in closed field line regions is explained by the lower (than in open field line regions) hot and core electron density and higher ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency, suppressing wave generation.

Abstract: Stars and planets in close systems are magnetised but the influence of magnetic fields on their tidal responses (and vice versa) and dissipation rates has not been well explored. We present exploratory nonlinear magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited inertial waves in convective envelopes. These waves probably provide the dominant contribution to tidal dissipation in several astrophysical settings, including tidal circularisation of solar-type binary stars and hot Jupiters, and orbital migration of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. We model convective envelopes as incompressible magnetised fluids in spherical shells harbouring an initially (rotationally-aligned) dipolar magnetic field. We find that depending on its strength (quantified by its Lehnert number Le) and the magnetic Prandtl number Pm, the magnetic field can either deeply modify the tidal response or be substantially altered by tidal flows. Simulations with small Le exhibit strong tidally-generated differential rotation (zonal flows) for sufficiently large tidal amplitudes, such that both the amplitude and topology of the initial magnetic field are tidally impacted. In contrast, strong magnetic fields can inhibit these zonal flows through large-scale magnetic torques, and by Maxwell stresses arising from magneto-rotational instability, which we identify and characterise in our simulations, along with the role of torsional Alfv\'en waves. Without tidally-driven zonal flows, the resulting tidal dissipation is close to the linear predictions. We quantify the transition Le as a function of Pm, finding it to be comparable to realistic values found in solar-like stars, such that we predict complex interactions between tidal flows and magnetic fields.

Abstract: We experimentally study nonlinear generation of the second harmonic by backward volume spin waves propagating in microscopic magnonic waveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator with a thickness of several tens of nanometers. We show that highly efficient resonant second harmonic generation is possible in the inter-mode regime at microwave powers of the order of 10^-4 W. In contrast to previously observed second harmonic generation processes, the generation by backward waves is characterized by the nonlinearly generated waves propagating opposite to the initial waves, and can be realized at zero bias magnetic field.

Abstract: Cosmic spherules have largely been classified into S-, I-, and G-types according to their compositions, and are identified to have chondritic or achondritic materials as precursors. A recent recovery expedition attempted to sample fragments of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 bolide retrieved roughly 850 magnetic particles, some of which have unknown origins. Among those identified were a new group of highly differentiated materials consisting of close to 160 specimens categorized as "D-type" particles. We studied the D-type particles with the goal of comparing their various morphological features to their chemical compositional groupings. Four morphological classifications are considered: "scoriaceous," "stubby," "blocky," and "vesicular." The specimens from the "scoriaceous" and "stubby" groups exhibit a spinel/magnetite rim in at least one instance, characteristic of atmospheric entry, and textures indicative of quenching such as dendritic microcrystalline structures, suggesting that a subset of specimens from these groups are candidates for materials of extraterrestrial origin. The particles exhibiting "blocky" and "vesicular" textures are likely to be terrestrial in origin, with no obvious quench features or signs of ablation. The D-type particles identified and characterized in this study have a spectrum of terrestrial and probable extraterrestrial origins.

Abstract: This paper seeks whether Alfv\'en waves (AW) can be produced in laboratory-scale liquid metal experiments, \emph{i.e.} at low-magnetic Reynolds Number ($R\!m$). AW are incompressible waves propagating along magnetic fields typically found geo and astrophysical systems. Until now, only faint linear waves have been experimentally produced in liquid metals because of the large magnetic dissipation they undergo when $R\!m\ll1$. Yet, controlling laboratory AW could emulate such far remote processes as anomalous heating in the solar corona, oscillations of the Earth inner core or turbulence in the solar wind. To answer this question, we force AW with an AC electric current in a liquid metal channel in a transverse magnetic field. We derive a wave-bearing extension of the usual low$-R\!m$ MHD approximation to identify two linear regimes: The purely diffusive regime exists when $N_\omega$, the ratio of the oscillation period to the timescale of diffusive two-dimensionalisation by the Lorentz force, is small. The propagative regime is governed by the ratio of the forcing period to the AW propagation timescale which, we call the Jameson number $J\!a$ after Jameson (1964), JFM. In this regime, AW are dissipative and dispersive as they propagate more slowly where velocity gradients are higher. Both regimes are recovered in the FLOWCUBE experiment, in excellent agreement with the model up to $J\!a \lesssim 0.85$ but near the $J\!a=1$ resonance, high amplitude waves become clearly nonlinear. Hence, in electrically driving AW, we were able to produce some of the propagative, diffusive and nonlinear processes of astro and geophysical AW.

Abstract: Ultra-sensitive cryogenic calorimeters have become a favored technology with widespread application where eV-scale energy resolutions are needed. In this article, we characterize the performance of an X-ray magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) using a Fe-55 source. Employing an optimum filter-based amplitude estimation and energy reconstruction, we demonstrate that an unprecedented FWHM resolution of $\Delta E_\mathrm{FWHM} = \left(1.25\pm0.17\mathrm{\scriptsize{(stat)}}^{+0.05}_{-0.07}\mathrm{\scriptsize{(syst)}}\right)\,\text{eV}$ can be achieved. We also derive the best possible resolution and discuss limiting factors affecting the measurement. The analysis pipeline for the MMC data developed in this paper is furthermore an important step for the realization of the proposed superfluid helium-based experiment DELight, which will search for direct interaction of dark matter with masses below 100 MeV/c$^2$.

Abstract: Electric polarization typically originates from non-centrosymmetric charge distributions in compounds. In elemental crystalline materials, chemical bonds between atoms of the same element favor symmetrically distributed electron charges and centrosymmetric structures, making elemental ferroelectrics rare. Compared to atoms, elemental clusters are intrinsically less symmetric and can have various preferred orientations when they are assembled to form crystals. Consequently, the assembly of clusters with different orientations tends to break the inversion symmetry. By exploiting this concept, we show that sliding ferroelectricity naturally emerges in trilayer quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) C$_{60}$, a cluster-assembled carbon allotrope recently synthesized. Compared to many metallic or semi-metallic elemental ferroelectrics, trilayer qHP C$_{60}$'s have sizable band gaps and several ferroelectric structures, which are distinguishable by measuring their second-harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Some of these phases show both switchable out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations on the order of 0.2 pC/m. The out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations can be switched independently and enable an easy-to-implement construction of Van der Waals homostructures with ferroelectrically switchable chirality.

Abstract: We describe in the context of the particle physics (PP) standard model (SM) `PP-SM' the understanding of the primordial properties and composition of the Universe in the temperature range $130\GeV>T>20\keV$. The Universe evolution is described using FLRW cosmology. We present a global view on particle content across time and describe the different evolution eras using deceleration parameter $q$. We follow the arrow of time in the expanding and cooling Universe: After the PP-SM heavies $(t, h, W, Z)$ diminish in abundance below $T\simeq 50\GeV$, the PP-SM plasma in the Universe is governed by the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon content. Once the temperature drops below $T\simeq 150\MeV$, quarks and gluons hadronize into strongly interacting matter particles. Rapid disappearance of baryonic antimatter completes at $T_\mathrm{B}=38.2\MeV$. We study the ensuing disappearance of strangeness and mesons in general. We show that the different eras defined by particle populations are barely separated from each other with abundance of muons fading out just prior to $T=\mathcal{O}(2.5)\MeV$, the era of emergence of the free-streaming neutrinos. We discuss the two relevant fundamental constants controlling the decoupling of neutrinos. We subsequently follow the primordial Universe as it passes through the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. The high density of positron antimatter disappears near $T=20.3\keV$: Nuclear reactions occur in the presence of a highly mobile and relatively strongly interacting electron-positron plasma phase. We apply plasma theory methods to describe the strong screening effects between heavy dust particle (nucleons). We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of the electron-positron plasma when exposed to an external primordial magnetic field.

Abstract: We report observations of direct evidence of energetic protons being accelerated above ~400 keV within the reconnection exhaust of a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at a distance of ~16.25 solar radii (Rs) from the Sun. Inside the extended exhaust, both the reconnection-generated plasma jets and the accelerated protons propagated toward the Sun, unambiguously establishing their origin from HCS reconnection sites located beyond PSP. Within the core of the exhaust, PSP detected stably trapped energetic protons up to ~400 keV, which is approximately 1000 times greater than the available magnetic energy per particle. The differential energy spectrum of the accelerated protons behaved as a pure power-law with spectral index of about -5. Supporting simulations using the kglobal model suggest that the trapping and acceleration of protons up to ~400 keV in the reconnection exhaust is likely facilitated by merging magnetic islands with a guide field between ~0.2-0.3 of the reconnecting magnetic field, consistent with the observations. These new results, enabled by PSP's proximity to the Sun, demonstrate that magnetic reconnection in the HCS is a significant new source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind. The discovery of in-situ particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection at the HCS provides valuable insights into this fundamental process which frequently converts the large magnetic field energy density in the near-Sun plasma environment and may be responsible for heating the sun's atmosphere, accelerating the solar wind, and energizing charged particles to extremely high energies in solar flares.

# Post-Polymerisation Modification of Polyethylene through Photochemical Oximation

## 通过光化学肟化对聚乙烯进行聚合后改性

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0qtt3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Martin, Lutz

Post-polymerisation modification (PPM) can provide access to functional polymers not readily available through bottom-up synthesis. Incorporating polar functional groups via PPM on the carbon-carbon backbone of polyolefins is a powerful strategy to tailor the polymer structure and enlarge the material property window. Here, we demonstrate the clean and efficient modification of polyethylene (PE) through the solvent- and catalyst-free photochemical oximation, using t-butyl nitrite (t-BuONO) as inexpensive and easy to handle NO radical source. The photochemical oximation uses LED long wave ultraviolet light and is run neat under aerobic conditions. The photochemical reaction conditions were optimised using linear small- to large-chain alkanes as model substrates. Using four different types of polyethylene (self synthesised low-molecular weight, commercially available low molecular weight and high molecular weight as well as post consumer material), we successfully incorporated oxime, ketone and nitro functional groups on the polymer backbone, without radical cleavage or crosslinking. The functionalisation degree of the three different functional groups is tuneable depending on the reaction atmosphere and system pressure, and the total functionalisation degree on the backbone can reach up to 2.9%. Detailed analysis, including 2D NMR spectroscopy with 15N-isotopically labelled modified PE produced with t-BuO15NO, provided insight into functional group distribution and regiochemistry, revealing that the photochemical oximation preferentially functionalises the pre-terminal carbon position and that the functional groups are randomly spaced apart on the polymer backbone rather than positioned adjacent to each other. Additionally, reactivity studies together with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy showed that the oxime is converted to the ketone via an iminoxyl radical species, confirming that it solely arises from the further reactivity of the oxime functional group via an iminoxyl radical pathway. These results demonstrate tuneable functionalisation, enabling the production of modified polyolefins with tailored properties that potentially broaden their application range and provide opportunities for improved recyclability.

**Authors:** James, Dawson

In this paper we build on previous work to characterise a new phase with stoichiometry Li3(OH)2Br existing between ∼225 degC and ∼275 degC in the LiBr-LiOH phase diagram. Diffraction studies indicate that the phase takes a hexagonal unit cell, and theoretical mod- elingisusedtosuggestapossiblecrystalstructure. Nuclearmagneticresonancespectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements demonstrate excellent lithium- ion dynamics in this phase, with an ionic conductivity of 0.12 S/cm at 250 degC. Initial attempts to stabilise this phase at room temperature through quenching were not successful. 1 Instead, a metastable state demonstrating poor lithium-ion conductivity is found to form. This is an important consideration for the synthesis of Li2OHBr solid-state electrolytes (also found in the LiBr-LiOH phase diagram) which are synthesised by cooling through phase fields containing Li3(OH)2Br, and are hence susceptible to these impurities.

**Authors:** Clare P, Grey

NaNiO2 (NNO) has been investigated as a promising sodium-ion battery (NIB) cathode material, but it is limited by degradation-induced capacity fade. On desodiation, NNO forms multiple phases with large superstructures due in part to Na+-ion vacancy ordering, however, their structures are unknown. Here, we report a structural solution to the Na2/3NiO2 (P/3) de-sodiated phase using combined Rietveld refinement of high-resolution synchrotron X-ray (SXRD) and neutron diffraction (NPD) data, magnetic susceptibility, and 23Na solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. Our experimental results are compared to Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations, which indicate multiple low-energy structures that are dynamically populated. We observe a combination of competing effects which contribute to the resultant dynamic nature of the structure, including honeycomb ordering of mixed-valence Ni, orbital-ordering of Jahn-Teller (JT) distorted Ni3+, and zigzag Na+/vacancy ordering. Our work provides evidence of the multiple contributions to the structures of de-sodiated Na2/3NiO2, along with a framework for investigating the other unsolved de-sodiated structures. This work may also inform understanding of the Jahn-Teller evolution in other nickel-rich lithium and sodium ion cathodes, such as LiNiO2.

# Direct synthesis of an iron metal-organic framework antiferromagnetic glass

## 铁金属-有机骨架反铁磁玻璃的直接合成

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5822781/latest

Glasses are ubiquitous in our everyday lives but still pose fundamental questions about the nature of order in solids. Typically formed by the rapid cooling of a liquid, these amorphous solids have broad applications, with vitreous silica (SiO2) the most well-known example.1 Most functional glasses are purely inorganic solids, restricting the range of functional properties feasible.2 Recently, a number of new metal-organic framework (MOF) glasses containing molecular components has been discovered by heating their crystalline counterparts to a melting point followed by a rapid cooling, thereby expanding the potential applications of glass materials.3&ndash;5 However, the melt-quenched (MQ) approach is limited to MOFs that melt, which is very restrictive as most MOFs readily decompose at heating to comparatively low temperatures.6 The low decomposition temperatures mean that glassy MOF samples typically include impurity decomposition products detrimental to functionality, as optical, electronic and magnetic contaminants. In this work, we present a direct route to prepare a family of MOF glasses without a meltable crystalline precursor. This route produces high-purity iron (II) MOF glasses, avoiding the oxidation and partial degradation commonly associated with the conventional melt-quenching process. The absence of magnetic impurities allows us to study the magnetic properties of the MOF glass itself and show that MOF glasses are good model systems for topologically disordered amorphous antiferromagnets. We also present the functional advantages of direct-glass synthesis by creating free-standing films of glassy MOFs and integrating them in optoelectronic devices. Direct-glass synthesis is thus a powerful route to exploit the true functional potential of glassy MOFs, not only realizing new MOF glasses but also unveiling properties that can be accessed with these materials.7
