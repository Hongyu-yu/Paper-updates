Their low-energy excitations are predicted to be magnons, but with linear energy-momentum dispersion, typical of antiferromagnets, and additional chiral splitting analogous to those of electronic bands. However, such predictions are made using linear spin wave theory, which considers infinitely long-lived noninteracting magnons.

Such corrections to noninteracting magnon bands could be detected by Raman scattering experiments, for which the recipe is provided. Although the same interaction effects are often described in magnetism by nonlinearity of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, direct comparison using altermagnetic magnons as the testbed, shows how such classical methods cannot fully reproduce the results of quantum many-body calculations.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRB/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevB.111.L020407.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

Abstract: We report charge to spin conversion in a hybrid heterostructure comprised of atomically thin bismuth (Bi) confined between a silicon carbide (SiC) substrate and epitaxial graphene (EG). We confirm composition, dimensionality, and a 96.5 \% intercalation coverage using X-ray photolectron spectroscopy, scanning transmission microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Electrical transport measurements show signs of weak antilocalization in the heterostructure, consistent with spin-orbit coupling in this hybrid heterostructure. Spin torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements in permalloy/EG/2D-Bi heterostructures probe charge-to-spin conversion and revealing that an in plane polarization of the spin current, perpendicular to the charge current. The ratio of the in-plane to out-of-plane torque is 3.75 times higher than in hydrogenated graphene control samples.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in magnetic topological insulators offers great potential to revolutionize quantum electrical metrology by establishing primary resistance standards operating at zero external magnetic field and realizing a universal "quantum electrical metrology toolbox" that can perform quantum resistance, voltage and current metrology in a single instrument. To realize such promise, significant progress is still required to address materials and metrological challenges -- among which, one main challenge is to make the bulk of the topological insulator sufficiently insulating to improve the robustness of resistance quantization. In this Perspective, we present an overview of the QAHE; discuss the aspects of topological material growth and characterization; and present a path towards an QAHE resistance standard realized in magnetically doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ systems. We also present guidelines and methodologies for QAHE resistance metrology, its main limitations and challenges as well as modern strategies to overcome them.

Abstract: This work analyzes the behavior of the interface between a ferromagnetic material and an alter-magnet. We use a well-established line of arguments based on electronic mean-field calculations to show that new surface phenomena that lead to altermagnetic materials induce an exchange bias effect on the nearby ferromagnet. We reveal the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon that lead to quantitative control over its strength. Interestingly, we predict exotic electric-field-induced phenomena. This is an analogy to the relationship between exchange bias and the injection of spin currents in spin-transfer-dominated scenarios, which has been reported earlier in the traditional antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic junction.

# Rigorous bound on diffusion for chaotic spin chains

**Authors:** Dimitrios Ampelogiannis, Benjamin Doyon

arXiv:2501.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of diffusion is one of the deepest physical phenomena observed in many-body interacting, chaotic systems. But establishing rigorously that correlation functions, say of the energy density, expand diffusively, remains one of the most important problems of mathematical physics. We show for the first time that diffusion is non-zero in almost every chaotic nearest-neighbor interacting quantum spin chain (spin-1/2, without magnetic field), at high enough temperatures. A chaotic system is defined in the precise sense that the Hilbert space of extensive charges is one-dimensional. Thus, under the widely expected assumption that almost every nearest-neighbor spin chain is indeed chaotic, we find that almost every nearest-neighbor spin chain has non-zero diffusion. Our main tool is the Green-Kubo formula for diffusivity, the mathematical technique of projection over quadratically extensive charges, and appropriate correlation decay bounds recently established. Our methods can be extended to finite or short ranges, magnetic field and higher spins. As we argue, according to the theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics, we further expect almost every nearest-neighbor interacting quantum spin chain to display superdiffusion, and thus have infinite diffusivity; however this is still beyond the reach of mathematical rigour.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the candidate Kitaev magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ possesses novel triple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic order instead of conventional single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag order. Here we present dedicated experiments in search for distinct properties expected of the triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order, namely, insensitivity of the magnetic domains to weak $C_3$ symmetry-breaking fields and fictitious magnetic fields generated by the spin vorticity. In structurally pristine single crystals, we show that $C_3$ symmetry-breaking in-plane uniaxial strains do not affect the order's magnetic neutron diffraction signals. We further show that $\mathbf{c}$-axis propagating light exhibits large Faraday rotations in the ordered state due to the spin vorticity, the sign of which can be trained via the system's ferrimagnetic moment. These results are in favor of the triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ and reveal its unique emerging behavior.

Abstract: Strongly correlated electrons at the verge of quantum criticality give rise to unconventional phases of matter and behaviors, with the discovery of new quantum critical materials driving synergistic advances in both experiments and theory. In this work, we report the structural and physical properties of a new quaternary Ce-based heavy fermion compound, Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$, synthesized using the self-flux method. This compound forms a layered tetragonal structure (space group $P4/nmm$), with square nets of Ce atoms separated by Si-Al or Ni-Si-Ge layers. Specific heat measurements show a low temperature Sommerfeld coefficient of 1.4 J/mol-Ce K$^{2}$, with a reduced entropy indicative of significant Kondo interactions. Below 0.6 K, an upturn in resistivity and a deviation in magnetic susceptibility suggest the appearance of magnetic ordering or the development of dynamic magnetic correlations, which is further supported by a bulge in specific heat around 0.4 K. These results suggest that Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$ is a layered heavy fermion metal, naturally located in proximity to a spin-density-wave quantum critical point.

Abstract: The polar magnets A$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ (A=Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni) feature a bipartite structure, where the magnetic A$^{2+}$ ions occupy two different sites with octahedral and tetrahedral oxygen coordinations. This bipartite structure provides a platform for the emergence of nontrivial magnetoelectric (ME) effects and intriguing excitation behaviors, and thus creates significant research interest. In this study, we conduct inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of Mn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, an L-type ferrimagnet in the A$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ family, to investigate its spin dynamics. The obtained magnetic excitation spectra reveal two distinct magnon dispersions corresponding to the octahedral and tetrahedral spins in Mn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. These magnon bands can be well described by a spin Hamiltonian including Heisenberg and single-ion anisotropy terms. Employing our effective spin model, we successfully reproduce the unusual temperature dependence of the L-type ferrimagnetic susceptibility through self-consistent mean-field theory. This research reveals the significance of the bipartite structure in determining the excitation properties of the polar magnets $\rm{A_{2}Mo_{3}O_{8}}$ and provides valuable insights into the spin dynamics of L-type ferrimagnets.

Abstract: The scalar spin chirality (SSC), defined as a triple product of spins, is essential for describing noncoplanar spin structures and understanding chiral physics in magnetic systems. Traditionally, SSC has been discussed primarily in the context of noncoplanar ground-state spin configurations at zero temperature, as collinear spin systems are generally thought to lack SSC. Consequently, whether the SSC can emerge at finite temperatures in spin systems with collinear ground states remains an open question and has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that thermally excited magnons can induce SSC even in collinear spin systems. By considering 2D ferromagnets on Kagome and honeycomb lattices, we demonstrate that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) which break the effective time-reversal symmetry in the magnon Hamiltonian can lead to finite SSC at finite temperatures. Using a simple spin model, we show both numerically and analytically that the SSC increases with the magnitude of DMI and temperature. Furthermore, calculations based on realistic material parameters reveal that the magnon-induced SSC can achieve a magnitude comparable to those observed in non-coplanar spin configurations. These findings suggest that SSC plays a significant role even in collinear spin systems, providing new insights into the chiral physics of magnetic materials.

Abstract: We present numerical simulations of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the L$_{2,3}$ edge of Ni in the weakly ferromagnetic altermagnet NiF$_2$. Our results predict a significant XMCD signal for light propagating perpendicular to the magnetic moments, which are approximately aligned along the [100] easy-axis direction. The analysis shows that the altermagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions to the XMCD signal can be uniquely distinguished by their dependence on an applied magnetic field. By varying the angle of the field relative to the easy axis, the in-plane orientation of both the N\'eel vector and the net magnetization can be systematically controlled. We further demonstrate that the XMCD signal, even under fields as strong as 40 T and for any in-plane orientation, can be accurately described as a linear combination of two spectral components, with geometrical prefactors determined by the field magnitude and direction. This insight enables experimental validation of the distinctive relationship between the N\'eel vector orientation and the x-ray Hall vector in the rutile structure. Quantitative simulations supporting these findings are provided.

Abstract: An ab initio scheme based on the linear response theory of exchange torque correlation is presented to calculate intrinsic Gilbert damping parameters in magnets of reduced dimensions. The method implemented into the real-space Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (RS-KKR) Greens' function framework enables to obtain diagonal elements of the atomic-site-dependent on-site and non-local Gilbert damping tensor. Going from the 3D bulk and surfaces of iron and cobalt ferromagnets addressed in our previous work [Phys. Rev. B 109, 094417 (2024)], in the present paper monolayers of Fe and Co on (001)- and (111)-oriented Cu, Ag, and Au substrates are studied, and particularly the substrate-dependent trends are compared. Furthermore, the Gilbert damping parameters are calculated for Fe and Co adatoms and dimers on (001)-oriented substrates. It is investigated how the damping parameter of single adatoms depends on their vertical position. This dependence is quantified in relation to the adatoms' density of states at the Fermi energy showing a non-monotonic behavior. By rotating the spin moment of the adatoms and collinear magnetic dimers, an anisotropic behavior of the damping is revealed. Finally, a significant, three- to ten-times increase of the on-site Gilbert damping is found in antiferromagnetic dimers in comparison to the ferromagnetic ones, whilst the inter-site damping is even more enhanced.

Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) plays an important role in different spintronic devices. The rapid development of spintronics requires a better understanding of the nature and mechanisms of the PMA formation. In our article, we demonstrate the potential of studying PMA by in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry combined with pulsed laser deposition. Using these techniques, we show the formation of out-of-plane anisotropy in thin CoFeB films (1.8 nm) with a capping Mo layer. Investigating thick (5.3 nm}) and thin (0.5 nm) molybdenum films, we demonstrate that in both cases, PMA was established in bilayer structures without any thermal annealing. Also, we demonstrate how an additional silicon layer grown over the CoFeB/Mo bilayer can critically alter the magnetic properties of the sample. Such studies are possible only through the unique combination of the growth method with the in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry measurement technique. We believe that this approach will open up broad opportunities for the development and investigation of new spintronic devices.

Abstract: Layered materials with non-centrosymmetric stacking order are attracting increasing interest due to the presence of ferroelectric polarization, which is dictated by weak interlayer hybridization of atomic orbitals. Here, we use density functional theory modelling to systematically build a library of van der Waals chalcogenides that exhibit substantial ferroelectric polarization. For the most promising materials, we also analyse the pressure dependence of the ferroelectric effect and charge accumulation of photo-induced electrons and holes at surfaces and internal twin boundaries in thin films of such materials.

Abstract: We investigate the lateral displacements for ballistic electron beams in a two-dimensional electron gas modulated by metallic ferromagnetic (FM) stripes with parallel and antiparallel (AP) magnetization configurations. It is shown that the displacements are negative as well as positive, which can be controlled by adjusting the electric potential induced by the applied voltage and the magnetic field strength of FM stripes. Based on these phenomena, we propose an efficient way to realize a spin beam splitter, which can completely separate spin-up and spin-down electron beams in the AP configuration by their corresponding spatial positions.

Abstract: OstravaJ is a Python package for high-throughput calculation of exchange interaction terms in the Heisenberg model for magnetic materials. It uses the total energy difference method, where calculations are based on the total energy of the system in different magnetic configurations, calculated by means of density functional theory. OstravaJ can propose a suitable set of magnetic configurations, generate VASP configuration files in cooperation with the user, and read VASP calculation results, which minimizes necessary human interaction. It can also calculate other relevant properties (e. g. MFA and RPA critical temperature, spin-wave stiffness) and provide input for various atomistic spin dynamics codes.
  We present results for a number of materials from various classes (metals, transition metal oxides), compared to other methods. They show that the total energy difference method is a useful method for exchange interaction calculation from first principles.

arXiv:2501.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically consider disorder and temperature effects on the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) using a variety of distinct and complementary analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, we address simple, physical, and experimentally relevant questions: How does disorder and/or temperature affect the IQHE plateau width? Does the plateau width increase or decrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the longitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the longitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there "floating" with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can disorder destroy the IQHE? Is there an IQHE to localization transition? What is the Landau level dependence of the plateau width? Our detailed theory provides answers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We discuss our results in the context of existing experimental results and suggest future experiments arising from our work. A key finding is that disorder and temperature are intrinsically connected in affecting IQHE, and there is an intricate interplay between them leading to nonmonotonicity in how the IQHE plateau width behaves as a function of increasing disorder. Both must be considered on an equal footing in understanding IQHE experiments.

Abstract: We report new magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K, a factor of three lower than those previously reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical to a quantum spin liquid regime. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice.

Abstract: The development of ferromagnet/heavy metal thin-film structures, such as CoFeB/Mo, with spin-orbit interaction requires advanced methods for their production and study. Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) provides unique insights into the evolution of magnetic properties, especially when applied in-situ during the growth process. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile method for producing magnetic thin films, and combining PLD with in-situ PNR measurements offers new possibilities for their investigation. In this work, we developed a compact vacuum chamber integrated into the neutron instrument, enabling step-by-step deposition and in-situ PNR measurements. A multilayer Mo/[CoFeB/Mo]12 structure was grown, and neutron reflectivity curves measured after each cycle revealed the gradual evolution of sample properties. A weak magnetic field response suggested the potential formation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at CoFeB/Mo interfaces. Additionally, a single CoFeB film was annealed up to 450{\deg}C, followed by the deposition of a ~5 {\AA} Mo layer. PNR measurements in magnetic fields of 0.01 T and 0.75 T showed a significant increase in in-plane magnetization, confirming PMA formation. Thus, we demonstrate the first successful operation of a combined PLD and in-situ PNR system, showcasing its capabilities for characterizing single-layer CoFeB and multilayer CoFeB/Mo thin-film structures.

Abstract: Quantum fluctuations can disrupt long-range order in one-dimensional systems, and replace it with the universal paradigm of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), a critical phase of matter characterized by power-law decaying correlations and linearly dispersing excitations. Using a Rydberg quantum simulator, we study how TLL physics manifests in the low-energy properties of a spin chain, interacting under either the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic dipolar XY Hamiltonian. Following quasi-adiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real-space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions. Finally, comparison to numerical simulations exposes the high sensitivity of TLLs to doping and finite-size effects.

Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.

Abstract: Nanoribbons - nanometer wide strips of a two-dimensional material - are a unique system in condensed matter physics. They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times, quantum confinement and topologically protected states can emerge. An exciting prospect for this new material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge. This combination of magnetism and semiconducting properties is the first step in unlocking spin-based electronics such as non-volatile transistors, a route to low-energy computing, and has thus far typically only been observed in doped semiconductor systems and/or at low temperatures. Here, we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). Static (SQUID) and dynamic (EPR) magnetization probes demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs exhibit macroscopic magnetic properties, arising from their edge, with internal fields of ~ 250 to 800 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at modest sub-1T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that upon photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funneled to a dark-exciton state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a unique candidate system for studying the interplay of magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics.

Abstract: We report on terahertz spectroscopic measurements of quantum spin dynamics on single crystals of a spin-1/2 frustrated spin-ladder antiferromagnet BiCu$_2$PO$_6$ as a function of temperature, polarization, and applied external magnetic fields. Spin triplon excitations are observed at zero field and split in applied magnetic fields. For magnetic fields applied along the crystallographic $a$ axis, a quantum phase transition at $B_{c1}=21.4 \mathrm{T}$ is featured by a low-energy excitation mode emerging above $B_{c1}$ which indicates a gap reopening. For fields along the $b$ axis and the $c$ axis, different field dependencies are observed for the spin triplon excitations, whereas no low-lying modes could be resolved at field-induced phase transitions. We perform a theoretical analysis of the magnetic field dependence of the spin triplon modes by using continuous unitary transformations to determine an effective low energy Hamiltonian. Through an exhaustive parameter search we find numerically optimized parameters to very well describe the experimentally observed modes, which corroborate the importance of significant magnetic anisotropy in the system.

Abstract: Altermagnets are defined as magnetic states with fully compensated spin angular momenta (spins) and broken PT (P: parity, T: time reversal, PT: parity times time reversal) symmetry. We classify three kinds of altermagnets: M-type: broken T symmetry and nonzero net magnetic moments, S-type: broken T symmetry and zero net magnetic moments, and A-type: unbroken T and broken P symmetries. Furthermore, strong altermagnets have spin split bands through exchange coupling in the non-relativistic limit, i.e., for zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and weak altermagnets has spin split bands only with non-zero SOC. These strong vs. weak altermagnets can be identified from the total number of symmetric orthogonal spin rotation operations. These classifications of altermagnets will be an essential guidance for the future research on altermagnetism.

Abstract: This study analyzes the calculation of the critical current density Jc,mag by means of Bean's critical state model, using the equation formulated by Gyorgy et al. and other similar equations derived from it reported in the literature. While estimations of Jc,mag using Bean's model are widely performed, improper use of different equations with different magnetic units and pre-factors leads to confusion and to significant errors in the reported values of Jc,mag. In this work, a SINGLE general equation is proposed for the calculation of Jc,mag for a rectangular parallelepiped sample in perpendicular field using Bean's critical state model, underlying how the simple conversion of magnetic units can lead to a Jc,mag in the desired units, without the need to introduce any other correction or use other specific equations depending on the units of Jc,mag. In this equation, the numerical pre-factor is dimensionless, independent of the unit system used. A comparison between the expression reported in the literature is done, showing how they can lead to different results depending on the used units, and that these results can be at least one order of magnitude different from the correct results obtained with the general equation proposed in this work. This resolves all ambiguities and aligns with the correct dimensional analysis, eliminates discrepancies in the calculated Jc,mag, and will avoid further propagation of errors in the literature.

Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.

Abstract: We consider Josephson junctions formed by coupling two conventional superconductors via an unconventional magnet and investigate the formation of Andreev bound states, their impact on the Josephson effect, and the emergent superconducting correlations. We focus on unconventional magnets known as $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound states in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions strongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and low-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are insensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states can be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction, which also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are prone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the magnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also demonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson junctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order, while the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the currents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent. Our results can serve as a guide to pursue the new functionality of Josephson junctions based on unconventional magnets.

Abstract: In this work, we study an Ericsson cycle whose working substance is a charged (quantum) oscillator in a magnetic field that is coupled to a heat bath. The resulting quantum Langevin equations with built-in noise terms encapsulate a thermodynamic structure and allow for the computation of the efficiency of the cycle. We numerically compute the efficiency of the cycle in the quasi-static regime using the steady-state thermodynamic functions of the system. Interestingly, it is found that by increasing the system-bath coupling strength, the efficiency of the cycle can be tuned to a maximum. We also explore the behavior of the efficiency as a function of the pair of magnetic-field values between which the cycle is operated.

Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing interest in understanding the actual magnetic ground state of the promising axion insulator candidate EuIn2As2, we present here a spin symmetry analysis and ab-initio calculations, aiming to identify specific exchange-dominated physics that could offer insights into the current debate. We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the helical and broken helical phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the broken helical phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our ab-initio calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a fast classical annealing scheme for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, employing the Suzuki-Kubo meanfield Ising dynamics (supplemented by a modified Thouless-Anderson-Palmer reaction field). The resultant dynamics, starting from any arbitrary paramagnetic phase (with local $m_i=\pm 1$ for the $i^{th}$ spin, and the global magnetization $m=0$), takes the system quickly to an appropriate state with small local values of magnetization ($m_i$) commensurate with the (frustrated) interactions. As the temperature decreases with the annealing, the configuration practically remain (in an effective adiabatic way) close to the ground state as the $m_i$'s and the spin glass order parameter $q$ grow to unity. For an $N$-spin SK model (with $N$ up to 10000) the deviation in the annealed ground state energy per spin $E^0_N - E^0$ is found to scale as $N^{-2/3}$, with $E^0 = -0.7633\pm 0.0002 $ (analytical estimate being $E^0 =-0.7631667265 \dots$), fluctuation $\sigma_N $ in $E^0_N$ decreases as $\sim N^{-3/4}$ and the annealing time $\tau_N \sim N$, making this protocol highly efficient in estimating the ground state of the SK model.

Abstract: We present a formalism based on colour symmetry to analyse the momentum-space spin textures of non-collinear magnets. We show that, out of the spin textures allowed by the magnetic point group, one can extract an `altermagnetic' component that is invariant by general rotations in spin space, and can exist in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate this approach in the case of three complex, non-collinear magnets, Mn$_3$Ir(Ge,Si), Pb$_2$MnO$_4$ and Mn$_3$GaN. For Mn$_3$GaN, we also show that the predictions of colour-symmetry analysis are consistent with density functional theory calculations performed on the same system both with and without spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: The paper aims to explore the impact of composite operators containing a few physical quantities on the gravitational and electromagnetic fields, studying the influencing factors and physical properties of octonion field equations. J. C. Maxwell first utilized the quaternions and vector terminology to describe the electromagnetic fields. The octonions can be used to simultaneously describe the physical quantities of electromagnetic and gravitational fields, including the octonion field potential, field strength, field source, linear momentum, angular momentum, torque and force. In the octonion spaces, the field strength and quaternion operator are able to combine together to become one composite operator, making an important contribution to the field equations. Similarly, the field potential can also form some composite operators with the quaternion operator, and they have a certain impact on the field equations. Furthermore, other physical quantities can also be combined with the quaternion operator to form several composite operators. In these composite operators, multiple physical quantities can also have a certain impact on the field equations. In other words, the field strength does not occupy a unique central position, compared to other physical quantities in these composite operators. In the field theories described by the octonions, various field equations can be derived from the application of different composite operators. According to different composite operators, it is able to infer the field equations when the field strength or/and field potential make a certain contribution, and it is also possible to deduce several new field equations when the remaining physical quantities play a certain role. This further deepens the understanding of the physical properties of field equations.

Abstract: The transition route from laminar to turbulent flow in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) duct with a square cross-section is investigated in the limit of low magnetic Reynolds number. In the presence of a transverse magnetic field, Hartmann and Shercliff layers are present on the walls orthogonal and parallel to the field direction, respectively. We assume reflection symmetries in both transverse directions, and investigate the competition between transition mechanisms specific to each boundary layer using direct numerical simulations. Independently of which wall turbulence eventually occupies, transition relies exclusively on a tripping of the Shercliff layer by perturbations, while the Hartmann layer plays a passive role. This is explained, using a dynamical systems interpretation, by the spatial localization of the edge states in the Shercliff layer at the expense of the Hartmann layer. The link between these non-linear coherent structures and the linear optimal modes known from non-modal stability and energy stability theory is pointed out.

Abstract: Chirality is a fascinating natural phenomenon with widespread applications in scientific research. Toroidal responses, distinct from chiral responses, represent an emerging and intriguing field that investigates toroidal electromagnetic phenomena. This field has garnered significant attention following the first experimental observations of oscillating toroidal dipoles and electromagnetic toroidal pulses. Breaking the symmetry of toroidal responses and observing chiral toroidal responses are crucial for advancing our understanding of toroidal phenomena and expanding the theoretical and practical applications of toroidal electrodynamics. Here, we present two complementary methods for breaking the symmetry of toroidal pulses and generating chiral space-time nonseparable helical pulses (SNHPs)-quasi-linearly polarized and chiral toroidal-across the optical and microwave spectral ranges. This was achieved through polarization decomposition of toroidal light pulses and direct emission from an ultrawideband spiral antenna, respectively. These advancements pave the way for experimental investigations into information transfer and light-matter interactions involving chiral SNHPs, including toroid-vortex coupling, classical-quantal entanglement, and optical machining, all of which are of growing interest in both fundamental science and practical applications.

Abstract: The phenomena of island healing and configuration transition induced by high-power electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) have been investigated in the island divertor configuration on the J-TEXT tokamak. Experimental results reveal that the size of the edge open magnetic island with mode number m/n = 3/1 decreases substantially under specific ECRH conditions. This process, referred to as island healing, occurs when ECRH with a power of 500~600 kW is deposited in the plasma core or when 250 kW of ECRH is deposited at r = 0.5 a, where a is the minor radius. The reduction of the island width makes the island divertor ineffective and transition into the limiter configuration. A model incorporating the influence of ECRH on the scrape-off layer (SOL) thermoelectric current is proposed to explain the observed changes in the edge magnetic topology of the island divertor configuration. These findings suggest that ECRH should be deposited at the plasma core with carefully controlled power to ensure the stable and compatible operation of ECRH and the island divertor configuration in tokamaks. The results can provide insights into achieving robust operation of an island divertor in tokamaks.

Abstract: The development of ferromagnet/heavy metal thin-film structures, such as CoFeB/Mo, with spin-orbit interaction requires advanced methods for their production and study. Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) provides unique insights into the evolution of magnetic properties, especially when applied in-situ during the growth process. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile method for producing magnetic thin films, and combining PLD with in-situ PNR measurements offers new possibilities for their investigation. In this work, we developed a compact vacuum chamber integrated into the neutron instrument, enabling step-by-step deposition and in-situ PNR measurements. A multilayer Mo/[CoFeB/Mo]12 structure was grown, and neutron reflectivity curves measured after each cycle revealed the gradual evolution of sample properties. A weak magnetic field response suggested the potential formation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at CoFeB/Mo interfaces. Additionally, a single CoFeB film was annealed up to 450{\deg}C, followed by the deposition of a ~5 {\AA} Mo layer. PNR measurements in magnetic fields of 0.01 T and 0.75 T showed a significant increase in in-plane magnetization, confirming PMA formation. Thus, we demonstrate the first successful operation of a combined PLD and in-situ PNR system, showcasing its capabilities for characterizing single-layer CoFeB and multilayer CoFeB/Mo thin-film structures.

Abstract: The search for axions sits at the intersection of solving critical problems in fundamental physics, including the strong CP problem in QCD, uncovering the nature of dark matter, and understanding the origin of the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry. The measurement of axion-mediated spin-dependent interactions offers a powerful approach for axion detection. However, it has long been restricted to regions outside the 'axion window' due to a significant trade-off: the need to effectively suppress the magnetic leakage from highly polarized spin sources while simultaneously detecting sub-femtotesla level exotic physics signals at sub-decimeter-scale distances. In this work, we report new experimental results on axion-mediated exotic spin-spin interactions using an iron-shielded SmCo$_5$ spin source in combination with a specially designed self-compensation comagnetometer. Employing a composite shielding structure, we achieved a suppression of the magnetic field by up to $10^{11}$. This enabled us to establish new constraints on the coupling between electrons and neutrons, surpassing previous experimental limits by more than 10000 times within the axion window. Furthermore, we also set strongest constraints on the coupling between electrons and protons. The proposed method holds substantial potential not only for advancing the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model but also for enabling transformative applications in biological and chemical research.

Abstract: The work investigates the features of galactic cosmic ray density and anisotropy behavior and their relation to solar sources, interplanetary and geomagnetic disturbances from May 8 to May 13, 2024. During this time, powerful solar flares and fast CMEs were recorded, leading to registration of an extreme geomagnetic storm along with one of the most significant Forbush effects for the entire observation period. All the calculations of cosmic ray characteristics are made using the data of global neutron monitor network and unique methods maintained at IZMIRAN: the Global Survey Method and the Ring of Stations Method. It is determined that the magnitude of Forbush effect under study was 15.7% (for particles with 10 GV rigidity) and as an extreme geomagnetic storm was recorded there was a significant magnetospheric effect observed in the data of neutron monitors (~4%).

Abstract: Quantum fluctuations can disrupt long-range order in one-dimensional systems, and replace it with the universal paradigm of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), a critical phase of matter characterized by power-law decaying correlations and linearly dispersing excitations. Using a Rydberg quantum simulator, we study how TLL physics manifests in the low-energy properties of a spin chain, interacting under either the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic dipolar XY Hamiltonian. Following quasi-adiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real-space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions. Finally, comparison to numerical simulations exposes the high sensitivity of TLLs to doping and finite-size effects.

Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.

Abstract: The largest electric fields between 18 and 30 solar radii are in narrow band waves simultaneously observed at a few Hz (somewhat above the local proton gyrofrequency) and a few hundred Hz (far below the lower hybrid frequency), with the higher frequency wave triggered at specific phases of the lower frequency wave. This wave pair, called triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), has been shown to both be physical and to occur at times of electron heating. A theory of electron heating and acceleration by the low frequency wave has been presented. While this theory and the TIAW results strongly suggest the presence of low frequency electric fields that are parallel to the local magnetic field, such fields have not been directly observed. In this paper, such parallel electric field observations are reported and TIAW are further described to conclude that they occur during about 75 percent of the Parker Solar Probe passes through 18 to 30 solar radii and, when present, they are the dominant wave signal, lasting for hours. In the presence of these parallel electric fields, electrons are heated while, in their absence, there is no electron heating. That there is no heating between 18 and 30 solar radii in the absence of TIAW is a most significant result because it invalidates other proposed mechanisms that predict heating in this radial range all of the time.

Abstract: During intense geomagnetic storms, the rapid and significant production of NO followed by its associated infrared radiative emission in lower thermosphere contributes crucially to the energetics of the upper atmosphere. This makes NO infrared radiative cooling a very important phenomenon which needs to be considered for accurate density forecasting in thermosphere. This study reports the investigation of variations in thermospheric density, and NO radiative cooling during the recent geomagnetic superstorm of May 2024. A very rare post-storm thermospheric density depletion of about -23% on May 12 was observed by Swarm-C in northern hemisphere in comparison to the prestorm condition on May 9. This overcooling was observed despite the continuous enhancement in solar EUV (24-36 nm) flux throughout the event. The thermospheric NO infrared radiative emission in the recovery phase of the storm seems to be the plausible cause for this observed post-storm density depletion. The TIMED/SABER observed thermospheric density between 105 and 110 km altitude shows an enhancement during this thermospheric overcooling. Our analysis also suggests an all time high thermospheric NO radiative cooling flux up to 11.84 ergs/cm2/sec during May 2024 geomagnetic superstorm, which has also been compared with famous Halloween storms of October 2003.

Abstract: We consider the coupled system of the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation and the conservation of linear momentum law to describe magnetic processes in ferromagnetic materials including magnetoelastic effects in the small-strain regime. For this nonlinear system of time-dependent partial differential equations, we present a decoupled integrator based on first-order finite elements in space and an implicit one-step method in time. We prove unconditional convergence of the sequence of discrete approximations towards a weak solution of the system as the mesh size and the time-step size go to zero. Compared to previous numerical works on this problem, for our method, we prove a discrete energy law that mimics that of the continuous problem and, passing to the limit, yields an energy inequality satisfied by weak solutions. Moreover, our method does not employ a nodal projection to impose the unit length constraint on the discrete magnetisation, so that the stability of the method does not require weakly acute meshes. Furthermore, our integrator and its analysis hold for a more general setting, including body forces and traction, as well as a more general representation of the magnetostrain. Numerical experiments underpin the theory and showcase the applicability of the scheme for the simulation of the dynamical processes involving magnetoelastic materials at submicrometer length scales.

# Reality of inverse cascading in neutron star crusts

arXiv:2408.08819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The braking torque that dictates the timing properties of magnetars is closely tied to the large-scale dipolar magnetic field on their surface. The formation of this field has been a topic of ongoing debate. One proposed mechanism, based on macroscopic principles, involves an inverse cascade within the neutron star's crust. However, this phenomenon has not been observed in realistic simulations. In this study, we provide compelling evidence supporting the feasibility of the inverse cascading process in the presence of an initial helical magnetic field within realistic neutron star crusts and discuss its contribution to the amplification of the large-scale magnetic field. Our findings, derived from a systematic investigation that considers various coordinate systems, peak wavenumber positions, crustal thicknesses, magnetic boundary conditions, and magnetic Lundquist numbers, reveal that the specific geometry of the crustal domain-with its extreme aspect ratio-requires an initial peak wavenumber from small-scale structures for the inverse cascade to occur. However, this same aspect ratio confines the cascade to structures on the scale of the crust, making the formation of a large-scale dipolar surface field unlikely. Despite these limitations, the inverse cascade remains a significant factor in the magnetic field evolution within the crust and may help explain highly magnetized objects with weak surface dipolar fields, such as low-field magnetars and central compact objects.

Abstract: Using two-dimensional general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of the sheath separating the black hole jet from the surrounding medium. We find that the electromagnetic power flowing through the jet sheath is comparable to the overall accretion power of the black hole. The sheath is an important site of energy dissipation as revealed by the copious appearance of reconnection layers and plasmoid chains. About 20% of the sheath power is dissipated between 2 and 10 gravitational radii. The plasma in the dissipative sheath moves along a nearly paraboloidal surface with trans-relativistic bulk motions dominated by the radial component, whose dimensionless 4-velocity is $\sim1.2\pm0.5$. In the frame moving with the mean (radially-dependent) velocity, the distribution of stochastic bulk motions resembles a Maxwellian with an `effective bulk temperature' of $\sim$100 keV. Scaling the global simulation to Cygnus X-1 parameters gives a rough estimate of the Thomson optical depth across the jet sheath $\sim 0.01-0.1$, and it may increase in future magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent radiative losses. These properties suggest that the dissipative jet sheath may be a viable `coronal' region, capable of upscattering seed soft photons into a hard, nonthermal tail, as seen during the hard states of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.

# Long-period oscillations as a proxy of the energy supply to the corona of the Sun

## 长周期振荡作为太阳日冕能量供应的代表

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4946833/latest

Photospheric motions are believed to be a crucial energy source for heating the solar and stellar coronae. Compared to short-period spectral components --- relative to the cutoff period (5 min)--- long-period components of photospheric motions are more energetic and, therefore, more promising candidates for coronal heating. However, whether the energy from these long-period motions can reach the corona remains uncertain. We present the detection of a 50-min decayless kink oscillation of a coronal loop, along with a corresponding oscillation in the photospheric magnetic field at the loop&rsquo;s footpoint with the same period. This finding indicates that the 50-min photospheric oscillation excites the coronal oscillation, suggesting that energy of long-period motions is indeed transported up to the corona. The observed transfer of the 50-min photospheric oscillation to the corona highlights the potential of low-frequency power in the photosphere as a significant energy source for sustaining the million-degree temperatures in the corona.

## 日出紫外分光偏振仪和成像仪: 独立偏振校准

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5818258/latest

Sunrise is a 1-m optical solar observatory carried aloft by a stratospheric balloon. It was developed to study magnetic fields and plasma flows in the solar atmosphere with very high spatial resolution and sensitivity. The Sunrise UV Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) operates in the 309-417 nm range, covering thousands of spectral lines that are poorly accessible from the ground and largely unexplored. The instrument includes a dual-beam polarimeter based on a rotating waveplate, a polarization beam splitter and two custom-made CMOS cameras.&nbsp; &nbsp;SUSI gathers data at high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. These data are stored onboard during flight. Given that SUSI does not include a polarimetric calibration unit onboard, its polarimetric demodulation matrix is estimated during laboratory calibration measurements prior to its flight. The quality of this calibration is crucial to accurately demodulate the data post-flight and reach the instrument's maximum polarimetric sensitivity goal of 1x10-3&nbsp;of the continuum intensity. In this paper, we report the results of eighth polarimetric calibrations of SUSI standalone, acquired at six different wavelengths using artificial LED light sources. The field-dependant demodulation matrices obtained are within the values expected from the design, including their polarimetric efficiencies and temporal stability. The matrices are also confirmed to satisfy the calibration repeatability criterion imposed by the SUSI sensitivity goal.
