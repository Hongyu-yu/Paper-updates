# Band Structure and Pairing Nature of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film at Ambient Pressure

## 大气压下La $_3 $ Ni $_2 $ O $_7 $ 薄膜的能带结构和配对性质

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10409

**Authors:** Zhi-Yan Shao, Yu-Bo Liu, Min Liu, Fan Yang

arXiv:2501.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, evidences of superconductivity with onset temperature $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40$ K) have been detected in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the LaSrAlO substrate at ambient pressure. This progress makes it possible to investigate the pairing mechanism in the bilayer nickelates through adopting various experimental tools. Here we perform a first-principle density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this nickelate superconductor. The obtained band structure is different from that of the pressurized bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ mainly in that the bonding-$d_{z^2}$ band is pushed far ($\approx$ 0.16 eV) below the Fermi level. Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the pseudo-tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer eight-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation approach to investigate the pairing symmetry. The obtained spin susceptibility is maximized at the momentum $Q = (0, 0.86\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone, induced by Fermi-surface nesting, leading to interlayer antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the diagonal double-stripe pattern similar with that reported for the bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The leading and subleading pairing symmetries are the $s^{\pm}$ and approximate $d_{xy}$, which are nearly degenerate. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.

# Driving a Quantum Phase Transition at Arbitrary Rate: Exact solution of the Transverse-Field Ising model

## 以任意速率驱动量子相变: 横向场Ising模型的精确解

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10478

**Authors:** Andr\'as Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Adolfo del Campo

arXiv:2501.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the crossing of the quantum phase transition in the transverse-field Ising model after modulating the magnetic field at an arbitrary rate, exploring the critical dynamics from the slow to the sudden quench regime. We do so by analyzing the defect density, the complete kink number distribution, and its cumulants upon completion of a linearized quench. Our analysis relies on the diagonalization of the model using the standard Jordan-Wigner and Fourier transformations, along with the exact solution of the time evolution in each mode in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The free-fermion nature of the problem dictates that the kink number distribution is associated with independent and distinguishable Bernoulli variables, each with a success probability $p_k$. We employ a combination of convergent and asymptotic series expansions to characterize $p_k$ without restrictions on the driving rate. When the latter is approximated by the Landau-Zener formula, the kink density is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and higher-order cumulants follow a universal power-law behavior, as recently predicted theoretically and verified in the laboratory. By contrast, for moderate and sudden driving protocols, the cumulants exhibit a nonuniversal behavior that is not monotonic on the driving rate and changes qualitatively with the cumulant order. The kink number statistics remain sub-Poissonian for any driving rate, as revealed by an analysis of the cumulant rations that vary nonmonotonically from the sudden to the slow-driving regime. Thanks to the determination of $p_k$ for an arbitrary rate, our study provides a complete analytical understanding of kink number statistics from the slow driving regime to the sudden quench limit.

arXiv:2501.10485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a non-contact quantitative measurement method for the thermal Hall effect (THE) based on magnetic-field-modulated lock-in thermography. This method enables visualization of THE-induced temperature change and quantitative estimation of the thermal Hall angle $\theta_{\rm THE}$ by applying periodic magnetic fields to a sample and obtaining the first harmonic response of thermal images. By combining this method with LIT-based measurement techniques for the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$, we also quantify the transverse thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$. We validate our measurement methods by estimating $\theta_{\rm THE}$, $\kappa_{xx}$, and $\kappa_{xy}$ in a ferromagnetic Heusler alloy Co$_2$MnGa slab showing large THE.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel platform to realize exotic electromagnetic properties distinct from those of conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We report results of micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on RuO2, of which altermagnetic nature has been under fierce debate. We have elucidated the band structure of the (100), (110) and (101) surfaces of a bulk single crystal. We found that, irrespective of the surface orientation, the experimental band structures obtained by ARPES commonly show a semi-quantitative agreement with the bulk-band calculation for the nonmagnetic phase, but display a severe disagreement with that for the antiferromagnetic phase. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES signifies a negligible spin polarization for the bulk bands. These results suggest the absence of antiferromagnetism and altermagnetic spin splitting. Furthermore, we identified a flat surface band and a dispersive one near the Fermi level at the (100)/(110) and (101) surfaces, respectively, both of which are attributed to the topological surface states associated with the bulk Dirac nodal lines. The present ARPES results suggest that the crystal-orientation-dependent topological surface/interface states need to be taken into account to properly capture the transport and catalytic characteristics of RuO2.

Abstract: Phonons, which carry circular atomic motions, offer a new route for mediating angular momentum in solids. However, controlling phonon angular momentum without altering the material's structure or composition remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile switching of angular momentum-carrying phonons by leveraging intrinsic ferrimagnetism in an insulator. We find a pair of chiral phonons with giant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magnetic field, the phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches can be switched along with the magnetization. Notably, near the critical temperature, the effective phonon magnetic moment is enhanced, reaching 2.62 Bohr magneton, exceeding the moment of a magnon. A microscopic model based on phonon-magnon coupling accounts for the observations. Furthermore, we identify two types of phononic domains with opposite phonon Zeeman splitting and propose the existence of topologically protected phononic edge modes at domain boundaries. These results demonstrate effective manipulation of chiral phonons with magnetism, and pave the way for engineering chiral phononic domains on the micrometer scale.

Abstract: MXenes have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their two-dimensional (2D) layered structure with various functionalities similar to the existing graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. Aiming to open a new application field for MXenes in the realm of electronic devices such as ultrahigh-integrated magnetic memory, we have developed a spin-orbit torque (SOT) bilayer structure consisting of bare MXene of Cr2N: substrate//Cr2N/[Co/Pt]3/MgO using magnetron sputtering technique. We demonstrate the field-free current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) in the Hall-cross configuration with the critical current density of ~30 MA/cm2. An attempt to replace the Cr2N layer by the Pt layer leads to the absence of field-free CIMS. As the SOT efficiency increases with increasing the Cr2N thickness, the first-principles calculation predicts the pronounced orbital-Hall conductivity in the out-of-plane component, compared to the spin-Hall conductivity in the Cr2N. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the out-of-plane uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N layer at the interface, by contacting with Co in the [Co/Pt]3 ferromagnetic layer. The interfacial spin-filtering-like effect against the out-of-plane polarized spin owing to the uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr might be a possible cause for the field-free CIMS. These results show a significant milestone in the advanced 2D-spintronics, promising low-power and ultrahigh-integration.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of strain and adsorbed H adatoms on the magnetic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using a combination of tight-binding and density functional theory methods for both, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic edge configurations (AFM). Our study reveals that longitudinal strain induces a significant enhancement in the edge magnetic moment, that we attribute to strain-driven modifications in the band structure. In addition, we describe H~adatoms within the tight-binding approach by employing both an unrelaxed vacancy model and the Anderson impurity model. By comparing to density functional theory results, we corroborate that the Anderson impurity model is best suited to describe H adsorption. We then focus on the metallic FM edge configuration of the ZGNRs to better exploit the tuning of its properties. We find that the magnetic configuration of H~adatoms is strongly influenced by the edges, with an AFM coupling between edges and the H~adatom. In fact, the magnetic spatial pattern of the H adatom differs to that found in graphene due to this edge coupling. Importantly, we find robust discrete plateaus of integer magnetic moment as strain is varied in the defected ZGNRs, that we relate to changes in the band structure, namely, a half-metallic character or the opening of a gap. This behavior can be of interest for magnetic applications of carbon-based nanostructures

Abstract: Particle physics and radio-frequency (RF) superconductivity have driven each other on since the 1970s. The unique properties of superconductors (SC) have been the enabling keys for the realization of accelerators with always increased performances thanks to the realization of all-superconducting cavities. The use of increasingly pure superconducting coatings for accelerating cavities, with lower and lower RF losses, determined such high-quality factors that the need to operate at low temperatures (below the superconducting transition temperature Tc) was well paid for. Recently, with respect to the path followed by the high frequency superconductivity, a new field opened since SCs are being considered for GHz operation in high dc magnetic fields, and measurements (and optimization) of totally different quantities are needed. The possibility of successfully using SCs in high magnetic fields for these purposes is far from obvious and it depends on the outcome of accurate measurements of usually overlooked quantities.

Abstract: The in-plane-magnetic-field-induced Hall effect (IPHE) observed in Weyl semimetals and PT-symmetric antiferromagnets has attracted increasing attention, as it breaks the stereotype that the Hall effect is induced by an out-of-plane magnetic field or magnetization. To date, the IPHE has been discussed mainly for materials with low-symmetry crystal/magnetic point groups. Here, we show that even if symmetry forbids an inherent IPHE that arises from any mechanism, an apparent IPHE can be generated by selecting a low-symmetry crystalline plane for measurement. For rutile RuO$_2$, although its high symmetry forbids an inherent IPHE, films grown along the low-symmetry (1 1 1) and (1 0 1) orientations are found to exhibit a distinct IPHE. The in-plane Hall coefficients are quantitatively reproduced by referring to the out-of-plane Hall coefficients measured for the high-symmetry (1 0 0) and (0 0 1) planes, indicating that the observed IPHE is caused by a superposition of inequivalent out-of-plane Hall effects. Similar behaviour is also observed for paramagnetic rutile systems, indicating the ubiquity of the apparent IPHE in electronic and spintronic devices with low-symmetry crystalline planes.

Abstract: Unconventional magnetic orders usually interplay with superconductivity in intriguing ways. In this work, we propose that a conventional superconductor in proximity to a compensated $p$-wave magnet exhibits behaviors analogous to those of Ising superconductivity found in transition-metal dichalcogenides, which we refer to as pseudo-Ising superconductivity. The pseudo-Ising superconductivity is characterized by several distinctive features: (i) it stays much more robust under strong $p$-wave magnetism than usual ferromagnetism or $d$-wave altermagnetism, thanks to the apparent time-reversal symmetry in $p$-wave spin splitting; (ii) in the low-temperature regime, a second-order superconducting phase transition occurs at a significantly enhanced in-plane upper critical magnetic field $B_{c2}$; (iii) the supercurrent-carrying state establishes non-vanishing out-of-plane spin magnetization, which is forbidden by symmetry in Rahsba and Ising superconductors. We further propose a spin-orbit-free scheme to realize Majorana zero modes by placing superconducting quantum wires on a $p$-wave magnet. Our work establishes a new form of unconventional superconductivity generated by $p$-wave magnetism.

Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) have sparked considerable interest due to the presence of several intertwined symmetry-breaking phases within a single material. Recently, hysteresis and reentrant superconductivity were observed experimentally through magnetoresistance measurements in RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, providing strong evidence of a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking superconducting state. The unconventional magnetic responses, combined with crystalline symmetry, impose strong constraints on the possible pairing symmetries of the superconducting state. In this work, we propose that RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an odd-parity superconductor characterized by spin-polarized Cooper pairs. The hysteresis in magnetoresistance and the reentrant superconductivity can both be explained by the formation and evolution of superconducting domains composed of non-unitary pairing. Considering the nodal properties of the kagome superconductor RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, it is topological and characterized by Majorana zero modes at its boundary, which can be detected through tunneling experiments.

Abstract: In this work, we report the study of electronic structure, magnetism, and the existence of Weyl nodes in a pristine bulk FeNi$_{3}$, a member of Fe-Ni inver alloy compounds, known as good metal catalysts with high activity and stability for water splitting for a very long time. Our observation of Weyl points in the bulk FeNi$_{3}$ may lead to a new technology to design highly efficient topological catalysts. While the previous literature \cite{PhysRev.97.304} mainly focused on the thermal and catalytic properties of FeNi$_{3}$ we report the interplay of Fe $d$-Ni $d$ hybridization and spin-orbit coupling give rise to the ferromagnetic Weyl nodes in the bulk FeNi$_{3}$. Our study shows that the ground state of the bulk FeNi$_{3}$ is a Weyl metal with a large number of Weyl nodes at the Fermi energy away from high-symmetry $k$-points. Furthermore, we predict a large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of about $10000~S/m$ at the ground state. In addition, we show the existence of Weyl nodes along the high symmetry $k$-points $~0.2eV$ above and $~0.05eV$ below self-consistent Fermi level that may be achieved either by the electron or hole doping, or by external perturbation. In this article, FeNi$_{3}$ has been studied to explore this scenario using first-principles density functional theory and subsequent Wannier90-based tight-binding method. Furthermore, we report the existence of two types of Weyl cones, type-I and type-II, $~0.2eV$ above the Fermi level. Our report provides a realistic material to further explore the intrinsic properties related to Weyl cones, and the spintronic applications.

Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a field of vast applicability, and layered magnetic materials have served as a ground for advancement in this direction. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed magnetic and specific heat studies on NdSbSe, (a ZrSiS-based structure) magnetic topological material. The temperature-dependent magnetization shows the presence of competing magnetic interactions ($T_N<150$ K) in addition to a long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below 4.2~K. In the AFM state, the isothermal magnetization confirms spin reorientation to the critical magnetic field of 40 kOe. Frequency-dependent ac-susceptibility measurements have probed the nonequilibrium dynamics of frustrated magnetic moments (near 150 K). The $\lambda$-like peak at 3.8~K observed in the specific heat shifts to a lower temperature with applied magnetic fields and validates the AFM order. In addition, the specific heat does not exhibit any sign corresponding to the short-range magnetic order near 150 K (spin-glass-like memory effect). In addition, the derived parameters from specific heat suggest the presence of a strong electronic correlation in NdSbSe, resulting in a Kondo-like signature in temperature-dependent resistivity data.

Abstract: Many decades of study have revealed very unusual properties of the helical phase transition in MnSi. This situation is briefly described and illustrated in the present note. As one will be able to see, one peculiarity is that the phase transition point in MnSi is accompanied by extremes of different thermodynamic and kinetic quantities on the high temperature side of the transition, which look similar to a property of 2D systems. The whole situation can be tentatively described as a phase transformation of the helical phase of MnSi to the paramagnetic state, which occurs in two steps, first as a first order phase transition and then following a breakdown of topological objects such as spin vortices.

Abstract: The control of ferroelectric domain walls and their dynamics on the nanoscale becomes increasingly important for advanced nanoelectronics and novel computing schemes. One common approach to tackle this challenge is the pinning of walls by point defects. The fundamental understanding on how different defects influence the wall dynamics is, however, incomplete. In particular, the important class of defect dipoles in acceptor-doped ferroelectrics is currently underrepresented in theoretical work. In this study, we combine molecular dynamics simulations based on an \textit{ab\ initio}-derived effective Hamiltonian and methods from materials informatics, and analyze the impact of these defects on the motion of 180$^{\circ}$ domain walls in tetragonal BaTiO$_3$. We show how these defects can act as local pinning centers and restoring forces on the domain structure. Furthermore, we reveal how walls can flow around sparse defects by nucleation and growth of dipole clusters, and how pinning, roughening and bending of walls depend on the defect distribution. Surprisingly, the interaction between acceptor dopants and walls is short-ranged. We show that the limiting factor for the nucleation processes underlying wall motion is the defect-free area in front of the wall.

Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), a hallmark of time-reversal symmetry breaking, has been reported in rutile RuO2, a debated metallic altermagnetic candidate. Previously, AHE in RuO2 was observed only in strain-relaxed thick films under extremely high magnetic fields (~50 T). Yet, in ultrathin strained films with distinctive anisotropic electronic structures, there are no reports, likely due to disorder and defects suppressing metallicity thus hindering its detection. Here, we demonstrate that ultrathin, fully-strained 2 nm TiO2/t nm RuO2/TiO2 (110) heterostructures, grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, retain metallicity and exhibit a sizeable AHE at a significantly lower magnetic field (< 9 T). Density functional theory calculations reveal that epitaxial strain stabilizes a non-compensated magnetic ground state and reconfigures magnetic ordering in RuO2 (110) thin films. These findings establish ultrathin RuO2 as a platform for strain-engineered magnetism and underscore the transformative potential of epitaxial design in advancing spintronic technologies.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with multifunctional properties, such as negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), magnetism, catalysis, and energy storage capabilities, are of significant interest for advanced applications in flexible electronics, spintronics, catalysis, and lithium-ion batteries. However, the discovery of such materials, particularly in low-dimensional forms, remains a challenge. In this study, we perform high-throughput density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore a new class of 2D V-shaped monolayers with remarkable physicochemical properties. Among 18 stable $M_4X_8$ (M = transition metal; X = halogen) compounds, we identify 9 auxetic monolayers, with \ce{Pd4I8} standing out for its exceptionally high NPR of -0.798. Notably, 4 of these materials exhibit half semiconductor properties, while 5 others are bipolar magnetic semiconductors, offering a unique combination of electronic and magnetic behavior. Additionally, these materials demonstrate promising catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) and show potential as anodes for rechargeable metal-ion batteries, particularly in alkali-ion systems. This work not only expands the family of 2D NPR materials but also introduces new candidates with multifunctional capabilities for a wide range of applications in nanoelectronics, catalysis, and energy storage.

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with a transition temperature $T_c$ close to 80 K at high pressures has attracted significant attention, due particularly to a possible density wave (DW) transition occurring near the superconducting dome. Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to the unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetic ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest the formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ simultaneously, thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.

Abstract: Kitaev spin liquid (KSL), consisting of the bond direction-dependent spin interactions in the honeycomb lattice, attracts huge attention because of its exact solvability and prospect for applications to quantum computing. An important feature of KSL is the half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity (HQTHC) under the magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice, but HQTHC stands only at low temperatures. Here, in the temperature range beyond the HQTHC regime, we theoretically propose the extrinsic phonon contribution to thermal Hall Effect in KSL via the skew-scattering of chiral phonons by the scalar spin chirality, which was previously studied in Mott insulators. We show the emergence of the scalar spin chirality of fluctuating spins, estimate the emergent field strength and its symmetric form applied to the chiral phonons, and obtain the associated thermal Hall conductivity, which is semi-quantitatively consistent with the existing experiments. This work provides a basic understanding of the role of spin-phonon interactions in strongly correlated systems.

arXiv:2501.11327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties of these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in the transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.

Abstract: We demonstrate a simple magnetic field stabilization technique in a Bose-Einstein condensate experiment. Our technique is based on the precise measurement of the current fluctuations in the main magnetic field coils and amounts to their compensation using an auxiliary coil. It has the advantage of simplicity as compensation is done using a low inductance coil that can be straightforwardly driven at the relevant frequencies (1 kHz). The performances of the different components (power supply, current transducer, electronics...) are precisely characterized. In addition, for optimal stability the ambient magnetic field is also measured and compensated. The magnetic field stability around 57 G is measured by Ramsey spectroscopy of magnetic field sensitive radiofrequency transition between two spin states of potassium 39 and the shot-to-shot fluctuations are reduced to 64(7) $\mu$G rms, i.e. at the 1 x 10 -6 level. In the context of our experiment, this result opens interesting prospects for the study of three-body interactions in Bose-Einstein condensate potassium spin mixtures.

Abstract: We report on the study of itinerant magnetism of lattice-trapped magnetic atoms, driven by magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, in the low-entropy and close-to-unit filling regime. We have used advanced dynamical decoupling techniques to efficiently suppress the sensitivity to magnetic field fluctuations. We have thus measured the spin coherence of an itinerant spin 3 Bose dipolar gas throughout a quantum phase transition from a superfluid phase to a Mott insulating phase. In the superfluid phase, a metastable ferromagnetic behavior is observed below a dynamical instability which occurs at lattice depths below the phase transition. In the insulating phase, the thermalization towards a paramagnetic state is driven by an interplay between intersite and superexchange interactions.

Abstract: We report on the stability of the magnetic dipole string (DS), a three-dimensional magnetic texture formed by two coupled Bloch points with opposite topological charges, separated by an equilibrium distance. Previous studies demonstrated the stability of such configurations through geometric confinement or coupling with local perturbations in the magnetization field, such as skyrmion strings or dislocations in helical modulations. Here, we show that, in uniaxial chiral magnets, an isolated DS remains stable in an unperturbed vacuum, thus representing a true three-dimensional soliton. The phase diagram illustrates the stability of the DS embedded in the conical or helical phases across a broad range of material parameters and external magnetic fields. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method applied to a regularized micromagnetic model, we demonstrate that isolated DSs are protected from collapse by an energy barrier. Stochastic spin-lattice simulations demonstrate that DSs can spontaneously nucleate during in-field annealing. This work aims to stimulate the experimental observation of DSs and further exploration of uniaxial chiral magnets.

Abstract: X-ray scattering has been an indispensable tool in advancing our understanding of matter, from the first evidence of the crystal lattice to recent discoveries of nuclei's fastest dynamics. In addition to the lattice, ultrafast resonant elastic scattering of soft X-rays provides a sensitive probe of charge, spin, and orbital order with unparalleled nanometre spatial and femto- to picosecond temporal resolution. However, the full potential of this technique remains largely unexploited due to its high demand on the X-ray source. Only a selected number of instruments at large-scale facilities can deliver the required short-pulsed and wavelength-tunable radiation, rendering laboratory-scale experiments elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate time-resolved X-ray scattering with spectroscopic contrast at a laboratory-based instrument using the soft-X-ray radiation emitted from a laser-driven plasma source. Specifically, we investigate the photo-induced response of magnetic domains emerging in a ferrimagnetic heterostructure with 9$\,$ps temporal resolution. The achieved sensitivity allows for tracking the reorganisation of the domain network on pico- to nanosecond time scales in great detail. This instrumental development and experimental demonstration break new ground for studying material dynamics in a wide range of laterally ordered systems in a flexible laboratory environment.

Abstract: We develop a Green's function approach for the nonequilibrium dynamics of multi-level quantum dots coupled to multiple fermionic reservoirs in the presence of a bosonic environment. Our theory is simpler than the Keldysh approach and goes beyond scattering state constructions. In concrete terms, we study Josephson junctions containing a quantum dot and coupled to an electromagnetic environment. In the dot region, spin-orbit interactions, a Zeeman field, and in principle also Coulomb interactions can be included. We then study quantum Mpemba effects, assuming that the average phase difference across the Josephson junction is subject to a rapid quench. For a short singlechannel junction, we show that both types of quantum Mpemba effects allowed in open quantum systems are possible. We also study an intermediate-length junction, where spin-orbit interactions and a Zeeman field are included. Again quantum Mpemba effects are predicted.

Abstract: Andreev spin qubits are a new qubit platform that merges superconductivity with semiconductor physics. The mechanisms dominating observed energy relaxation remain unidentified. We report here on three steps taken to address these questions in an InAs nanowire weak link. First, we designed a microwave readout circuit tuned to be directly sensitive to the spin-dependent inductance of the weak link so that higher orbital states are not necessary for readout -- this resulted in larger windows in parameter space in which the spin state properties can be probed. Second, we implemented a successful gap-engineering strategy to mitigate quasiparticle poisoning. Third, the weak link was fabricated by \textit{in situ} shadow evaporation, which has been shown to improve atomic-scale disorder. We show how our design allows characterization of the spin stability and coherence over the full range of magnetic flux and gate voltage of an odd parity bias point. The spin relaxation and dephasing rates are comparable with the best devices previously reported, suggestive that surface atomic-scale disorder and QP poisoning are not linked to spin relaxation in InAs nanowires. Our design strategies are transferrable to novel materials platforms for Andreev qubits such as germanium and carbon.

Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) host topologically protected edge states, but the role that these edge states play in electronic transport remains unclear. Using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy, we performed local measurements of the current distribution in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at large bias currents, where the quantization of the conductivity tensor breaks down. We find that bulk currents in the channel interior coexist with edge currents at the sample boundary. While the position of the edge current changes with the reversal of the magnetic field, it does not depend on the current direction. To understand our observations, we introduce a model which includes contributions from both the sample magnetization and currents driven by chemical potential gradients. To parameterize our model, we use local measurements of the chemical potential induced changes in the sample magnetization. Our model reveals that the observed edge currents can be understood as changes in the magnetization generated by the electrochemical potential distribution in the sample under bias. Our work underscores the complexity of electronic transport in MTIs and highlights both the value and challenges of using magnetic imaging to disentangle various contributions to the electronic transport signatures.

arXiv:2501.11751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general mechanism for large charge and spin Josephson diode effects in strongly spin-polarized superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures with a noncoplanar spin texture, formulated in terms of quantum-geometric phases. We present necessary conditions for this effect to occur, and show numerical results for disordered materials, relevant for applications. We calculate Josephson diode efficiencies for both charge- and spin-diodes and show that a spin-diode efficiency of 100% can be reached. Finally, we present a SQUID device that can switch between nearly pure spin-up and spin-down equal-spin supercurrents across the ferromagnet by reversing the flux. These findings establish functionalities that are absent for coplanar spin textures.

Abstract: Nitrogen Vacancy diamond nanoparticles (NVNPs) are increasingly integrated with methods for optical detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR), providing new opportunities in magnetic characterization that span the visualization of magnetic fields in microelectronic circuits, environmental sensing and biology. However, only a small number of studies utilize aggregates of NVNPs for surface-wide magnetometry being that spin orientations in aggregate NVNPs are inherently misaligned, precluding their use for proper magnetic field detection compared with expensive monocrystalline diamonds. A postprocessing method for layering NVNPs with aligned NV center orientations can potentially facilitate superior NV magnetometry by allowing sensitive detection combined with simplified probe preparation. We present a novel technology for creating densely stacked monolayers of NVNP with inherent interlayer alignment for sensitive measurement of local magnetic field perturbations in microelectronic traces. We establish spatial characteristics of deposited aggregates and demonstrate their ability to capture magnetic dipoles from conducting microwires via ODMR. Our approach forms a novel accessible protocol that can be used for broad applications in micromagnetometry.

Abstract: Muon-spin-rotation ($\mu$SR) experiments and the observation of a spontaneous Nernst effect indicate time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS) at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ above the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x\approx0.8$. Further studies have pointed out that BTRS is caused by the formation of a new state of matter associated with the condensation of pairs of electron pairs. Despite exhibiting multiple unconventional effects that warrant further investigation, the electronic spectral properties of this electron quadrupling state remain largely unexplored. Here, we present detailed $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x = 0.77$, which has $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ > $T_{\rm c}$ according to measurements of the spontaneous Nernst effect. The NMR data obtained in this work provide the first direct electronic spectral characteristics of the electron quadrupling state by indicating that it evolves from a pseudogap that sets in at $T^*$ well above $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$. This pseudogap behavior is consistent with $\mu$SR Knight-shift, specific-heat, and transport data indicating the formation of a bound state of electrons. According to a theory of electron quadrupling condensates, such bound-state formations should precede the onset of BTRS correlations between pairs of electron pairs. The second important insight from NMR data is the absence of spin-related magnetism. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1T$ and the evolution of the NMR linewidth prove the absence of a magnetic transition at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ and rule out even a proximity to some magnetic instability. This indicates that the spontaneous magnetic fields detected in this compound are not caused by spin magnetism but are associated with persistent real-space currents.

Abstract: In a three-spin-center system, antiferromagnetic exchange interactions give rise to two ground-state doublets, each state within the doublet exhibiting distinct spin-spectrum chirality. This chirality becomes significant when external perturbations are introduced. We explored, from a theoretical perspective, the presence of spin-chirality in Lanthanide complexes that feature two magnetic centers. The applied electric-potential, couples to the system electric dipole moment ($\mu$), modifying the spin-orbit interaction ($\hat{L}.\hat{S}$). This modification is formally expressed through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), whose role is to selectively activate one spin state in the doublet pair, as confirmed by computing the scalar spin-chirality ($\chi$). To validate the presence of chiral spin states, we performed spin-dynamics simulations using the Liouville-von Neumann equation within the density matrix formalism. The initial state was prepared as a superposition $1/\sqrt{2}(\rho_{01}+\rho_{10})$, and its time evolution revealed that each state in the doublet acquires a distinct phase, indicating their residence in separate phase spaces. This also demonstrated that the fidelity of the initial prepared state remains stable over an extended period.

Abstract: High frequency applications of superconductors in a dc magnetic field rely on the estimate of the characteristic crossover frequency $\nu_c$ between low and high losses. Customarily, high sensitivity resonant techniques, intrinsically operating at discrete frequencies, are used to estimate $\nu_c$. We exploit here a method based on a dual frequency resonator. We show that single-frequency evaluations of $\nu_c$ lead to heavy underestimations of the superconductor surface resistance. We describe a combined analytical and experimental approach that gives more accurate estimates for $\nu_c$, and additionally allows to test the underlying physical model.

# Basic aspects of ferroelectricity induced by noncollinear alignment of spins

## 自旋的非共线排列引起的铁电性的基本方面

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11970

**Authors:** I. V. Solovyev

arXiv:2501.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basic principles of ferroelectric activity induced by the noncollinear spins are reviewed. There is a fundamental reason why the inversion symmetry can be broken by magnetic order. Such situation occurs when the magnetic order simultaneously involves ferromagnetic ($F$) and antiferromagnetic ($A$) patterns, transforming under the spatial inversion $\mathcal{I}$ and time reversal $\mathcal{T}$ as $\mathcal{I}F=F$ and $\mathcal{IT}A=A$. The incompatibility of these two conditions breaks the inversion symmetry, imposing a constraint on possible dependencies of polarization on directions of spins, which can include only antisymmetric coupling and single-ion anisotropy in the from $\vec{P} = \vec{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}}_{12} [ \boldsymbol{e}_{1} \times \boldsymbol{e}_{2} ] + \boldsymbol{e}_{1} \vec{\mathbb{\Pi}} \boldsymbol{e}_{1} - \boldsymbol{e}_{2} \vec{\mathbb{\Pi}} \boldsymbol{e}_{2}$. $\vec{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}}_{12}$ can be evaluated in the framework of superexchange theory, resulting in $\vec{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}}_{12} \sim \vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}^{\phantom{0}}$, where $\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}^{\phantom{0}}$ is the part of the position operator produced by the spin-orbit coupling. $\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}$ remains invariant under $\mathcal{I}$, explaining why noncollinear spins can induce $\vec{P}$ even in the centrosymmetric case. The properties of $\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}$ are rationalized from the viewpoint of symmetry of the Kramers states. The Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky rule $\vec{P} \propto \vec{\epsilon}_{21} \times [\boldsymbol{e}_{1} \times \boldsymbol{e}_{2}]$ ($\vec{\epsilon}_{21}$ being the bond direction) is justified only for relatively high symmetry. The single-ion anisotropy vanishes for the spin 1/2 or if magnetic ions are located in the inversion centers. The properties of known multiferroics are reconsidered from the viewpoint of these principles.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals compounds exhibit interesting electronic and magnetic properties due to complex intra-layer and inter-layer interactions, which are of immense importance in realizing exotic physics as well as advanced technology. Various experimental and theoretical studies led to significantly different ground state properties often contrasting each other. Here, we studied a novel 2D material, CrSiTe3 employing magnetic, specific heat and Raman measurements. Experimental results reveal evidence of incipient antiferromagnetism below 1 kOe concomitant to ferromagnetic order at 33 K. Antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions coexists at low field in the temperature regime, 15 - 33 K. Low field data reveal an additional magnetic order below 15 K, which melts on application of external magnetic field and remain dark in the heat capacity data. Raman spectra exhibit anomalies at the magnetic transitions; an evidence of strong spin-lattice coupling. Below 15 K, Eg modes exhibit hardening while Ag modes become significantly softer suggesting weakening of the inter-layer coupling at low temperatures which might be a reason for the unusual magnetic ground state and field induced melting of the magnetic order. These results reveal evidence of exceptional ground state properties linked to spin-lattice coupling and also suggest a pathway to study complex magnetism in such technologically important materials.

Abstract: Here we present experimental evidence of the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4, based on specific heat, magnetic entropy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We demonstrate that the two crystallographic Tm3+ sites give rise to distinct single-ion anisotropies, and by extension, SrTm2O4 hosts two magnetic sublattices. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals low-lying dispersing crystal-field excitations, which we modelled using an effective charge model and mean field random phase approximation. The extracted magnetic exchange interactions are both antiferromagnetic and frustrated for both chains. Interchain magnetic exchange interactions are negligible. The strength of the magnetic exchange interactions in relation to the size of crystal field gaps, together with the frustration and low dimensionality, force the system to remain paramagnetic down to the lowest experimentally reachable temperature despite the pseudo-doublet nature of its ground state.

# Generalized Bond Polarizability model for more accurate atomistic modeling of Raman spectra

**Authors:** Atanu Paul, Nagaprasad Reddy Samala, Ilya Grinberg

arXiv:2501.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is an important tool for studies of molecules, liquids and solids. While Raman spectra can be obtained theoretically from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this requires the calculation of the electronic polarizability along the simulation trajectory. First-principles calculations of electronic polarizability are computationally expensive, motivating the development of atomistic models for the evaluation of the changes in the electronic polarizability with the changes in the atomic coordinates of the system. The bond polarizability model (BPM) is one of the oldest and simplest such atomistic models, but cannot reproduce the effects of angular vibrations, leading to inaccurate modeling of Raman spectra. Here, we demonstrate that the generalization of BPM through inclusion of terms for atom pairs that are traditionally considered to be not involved in bonding dramatically improves the accuracy of polarizability modeling and Raman spectra calculations. The generalized BPM (GBPM) reproduces the ab initio polarizability and Raman spectra for a range of tested molecules (SO2, H2S, H2O, NH3, CH4, CH3OH and CH3CH2OH) with high accuracy and also shows significantly improved agreement with ab initio results for the more complex ferroelectric BaTiO3 systems. For liquid water, the anisotropic Raman spectrum derived from atomistic MD simulations using GBPM evaluation of polarizability shows significantly improved agreement with the experimental spectrum compared to the spectrum derived using BPM. Thus, GBPM can be used for the modeling of Raman spectra using large-scale molecular dynamics and provides a good basis for the further development of atomistic polarizability models.

arXiv:2501.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultrathin ferromagnetic films sandwiched between two distinct heavy metal layers or between a heavy metal and an oxide layer, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is recognized as being of interfacial origin. Its chirality and strength are determined by the properties of the adjacent heavy metals and the degree of oxidation at the interfaces. Here, we demonstrate that the chirality of the DMI can change solely with variations in the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer - an effect that has not been experimentally observed or explained until now. Our experimental observation in the trilayer system Ta/FeCoB/TaOx is supported by ab initio calculations: they reveal that variations in orbital filling and inter-atomic distances at the interface, driven by the number of ferromagnetic atomic layers, lead to an inversion of DMI chirality. This mechanism takes place for ferromagnetic layers with more than three atomic layers, for which the two interfaces start to be decoupled. We hence propose a new degree of freedom to tune DMI chirality and the associated chiral spin textures by tailoring crystal structure e.g. using strain or surface acoustic waves.

Abstract: We investigate de Gennes and Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. In a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet can generate de Gennes and Saint-James states in a short junction due to the enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors, resulting in the vanishing zero-biased conductance peak with pronounced resonance spikes in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the de Gennes and Saint-James states are not found for $d_{xy}$-altermagnet in the short junction but can be formed in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I\left( \varphi \right) $ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi $ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $ d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $ d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.

Abstract: The coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes are studied in a FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite bulk crystal, using time-resolved Kerr ellipticity in a two-color pump-probe scheme. The probe photon energy is tuned to the exciton resonance, while the pump photon energy is detuned from it up to 0.75 eV to higher energies. The spin-oriented electrons and holes photogenerated with significant excess kinetic energy relax into states in vicinity of the band gap, where they undergo Larmor precession in an external magnetic field. At cryogenic temperatures down to 1.6 K, the spin dephasing time reaches the nanosecond range. During energy relaxation, the carrier spin relaxation is inefficient and only happens when the carriers become localized. In experiments with two pump pulses, all-optical control of the amplitudes and phases of the electron and hole spin signals is achieved in the additive regime by varying the intensities of the pump pulses and the time delay between them.

arXiv:2501.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.

arXiv:2501.12232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the spin-resolved Josephson diode effect (JDE) in strongly spin-polarized ferromagnets (sFM) coupled to singlet superconductors (SC) via ferromagnetic insulating interfaces (FI). All metallic parts are described in the framework of the quasiclassical Usadel Green's function theory applicable to diffusive systems. The interfaces are characterized by an S-matrix obtained for a model potential with exchange vectors pointing in an arbitrary direction with respect to the magnetization in the sFM. Our theory predicts a large charge Josephson diode effect with an efficiency exceeding $33\%$ and a perfect spin diode effect with $100\%$ efficiency. To achieve these the following conditions are necessary: (i) a noncoplanar profile of the three magnetization vectors in the system and (ii) different densities of states of spin-$\uparrow$ and spin-$\downarrow$ bands in the sFM achieved by a strong spin polarization. The former gives rise to the quantum-geometric phase, $\Delta\varphi$, that enters the theory in a very similar manner as the superconducting phase difference across the junction, $\Delta\chi$. We perform a harmonic analysis of the Josephson current in both variables and find symmetries between Fourier coefficients allowing an interpretation in terms of transfer processes of multiple equal-spin Cooper pairs across the two ferromagnetic spin bands. We point out the importance of crossed pair transmission processes. Finally, we study a spin-switching effect of an equal-spin supercurrent by reversing the magnetic flux in a SQUID device incorporating the mentioned junction and propose a way for measuring it.

Abstract: Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.

Abstract: Engineering all fundamental magnetic phases within a single material platform would mark a significant milestone in materials science and spintronics, reducing complexity and costs in device fabrication by eliminating the need for integrating and interfacing different materials. Here, we demonstrate that graphene can host all non-relativistic magnetic phases-namely, diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, altermagnetism and fully compensated ferrimagnetism -- by using single hydrogen atoms as building blocks. Through precise manipulation of these atoms by scanning tunneling microscopy, we can experimentally create all such magnetic phases. Their different magnetic character is confirmed by density functional theory and mean-field Hubbard calculations. In particular, we show that the new magnetic paradigm known as altermagnetism can be realized, exhibiting directionally spin-split energy bands coexisting with zero net magnetization due to protecting spatial symmetries. It is furthermore possible to create fully compensated ferrimagnets, lacking these symmetries and therefore presenting unrestricted spin splitting of the bands, with a vanishing net magnetization which in this case is protected by Lieb's theorem. These findings put forward H-functionalized graphene as a versatile platform to design, build and study these new emergent magnetic phases at the atomic scale.

# Stability of the $\pi$-Flux Phase for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled to Fermionic Matter

Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Ising gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter. In absence of electric fields, we prove that, at half-filling, the ground state of the gauge theory coincides with the $\pi$-flux phase, associated with magnetic flux equal to $\pi$ in every elementary lattice plaquette, provided the fermionic hopping is large enough. This proves in particular the semimetallic behavior of the ground state of the model. Furthermore, we compute the magnetic susceptibility of the gauge theory, and we prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions, thus rigorously justifying recent numerical computations. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient.

Abstract: Systemic drug administration often causes off-target effects limiting the efficacy of advanced therapies. Targeted drug delivery approaches increase local drug concentrations at the diseased site while minimizing systemic drug exposure. We present a magnetically guided microrobotic drug delivery system capable of precise navigation under physiological conditions. This platform integrates a clinical electromagnetic navigation system, a custom-designed release catheter, and a dissolvable capsule for accurate therapeutic delivery. In vitro tests showed precise navigation in human vasculature models, and in vivo experiments confirmed tracking under fluoroscopy and successful navigation in large animal models. The microrobot balances magnetic material concentration, contrast agent loading, and therapeutic drug capacity, enabling effective hosting of therapeutics despite the integration complexity of its components, offering a promising solution for precise targeted drug delivery.

arXiv:2501.11681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for deriving the thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of "atoms" carrying an arbitrary irreducible representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through long-range two-body quadratic interactions. Using this formalism, we derive the thermodynamics and phase structure of ferromagnets with atoms in the doubly symmetric or doubly antisymmetric irreducible representations. The symmetric representation leads to a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase with transitions similar to the ones for the fundamental representation studied before. The antisymmetric representation presents qualitatively new features, leading to a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist over a range of temperatures, two of them becoming metastable. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems of atoms with reduced symmetry in their interactions compared to the fundamental case.

# Using Space-Filling Curves and Fractals to Reveal Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Neuroimaging Data

Abstract: We present a novel method, Fractal Space-Curve Analysis (FSCA), which combines Space-Filling Curve (SFC) mapping for dimensionality reduction with fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The method is suitable for multidimensional geometrically embedded data, especially for neuroimaging data which is highly correlated temporally and spatially. We conduct extensive feasibility studies on diverse, artificially generated data with known fractal characteristics: the fractional Brownian motion, Cantor sets, and Gaussian processes. We compare the suitability of dimensionality reduction via Hilbert SFC and a data-driven alternative. FSCA is then successfully applied to real-world magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) scans.
  The method utilizing Hilbert curves is optimized for computational efficiency, proven robust against boundary effects typical in experimental data analysis, and resistant to data sub-sampling. It is able to correctly quantify and discern correlations in both stationary and dynamic two-dimensional images. In MRI Alzheimer's dataset, patients reveal a progression of the disease associated with a systematic decrease of the Hurst exponent. In fMRI recording of breath-holding task, the change in the exponent allows distinguishing different experimental phases.
  This study introduces a robust method for fractal characterization of spatial and temporal correlations in many types of multidimensional neuroimaging data. Very few assumptions allow it to be generalized to more dimensions than typical for neuroimaging and utilized in other scientific fields. The method can be particularly useful in analyzing fMRI experiments to compute markers of pathological conditions resulting from neurodegeneration. We also showcase its potential for providing insights into brain dynamics in task-related experiments.

Abstract: Micro-electro-mechanical resonators employing a magnetic element have been proposed for magnetic field sensing applications, but the integration of magnetic materials with standard semiconductor compounds is challenging and requires complex fabrication protocols. We present a different approach relying on (La0.7,Sr0.3)MnO3 (LSMO), an oxide compound that works both as structural element for the resonator and functional magnetic layer. Suspended trampolines are realized in a single step process from LSMO thin films and show quality factor up to 60k and fQ products reaching 10$^{10}$ Hz. Their magnetic properties are probed by a SQUID magnetometer and magnetic force microscopy, showing saturation magnetization of 240 kA/m at room temperature and in-plane magnetic domains with coercivity of 2.5 mT. Being entirely made from a magnetic material, these resonators exhibit a larger magnetic interaction volume compared to other solutions, making them ideal candidates as building blocks for high-sensitivity magnetic field sensors.

Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr\"odinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.

Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) are narrow gap semiconductor materials that combine non-trivial band topology and magnetic order. Unlike their nonmagnetic counterparts, MTIs may have some of the surfaces gapped due to breaking the time-reversal symmetry, which enables a number of exotic phenomena having potential applications in spintronics. So far, MTIs have only been created by means of doping nonmagnetic TIs with 3d transition metal elements, however, such an approach leads to strongly inhomogeneous magnetic and electronic properties of these materials, restricting the observation of important effects to very low temperatures. Finding intrinsic MTI, i.e. a stoichiometric well-ordered magnetic compound, could be an ideal solution to these problems, but no such material was observed to date. Here, using density functional theory we predict and further confirm by means of structural, transport, magnetic, angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements the realization of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) TI phase, that is hosted by the van der Waals layered compound MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. An interlayer AFM ordering makes MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ invariant with respect to the combination of the time-reversal ($\Theta$) and primitive-lattice translation ($T_{1/2}$) symmetries, $S = \Theta T_{1/2}$, giving rise to the $Z_2$ topological classification of AFM insulators. We find $Z_2 = 1$ for MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, which confirms its topologically nontrivial nature. The $S$-breaking (0001) surface of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ exhibits a giant bandgap in the topological surface state as evidenced by ab initio calculations and photoemission measurements. These results culminate almost a decade-long search of an AFMTI, predicted in 2010. Furthermore, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is the first intrinsic magnetic TI realized experimentally.

Abstract: We report the electrochemical tuning of magnetic properties in the Na2Mn3O7 maple-leaf lattice (MLL) through ion deintercalation, revealing a switch from the 1D antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-chain behavior of the S=3/2 MLL structure to frustrated magnetism spin-glass behavior. By utilizing Na deintercalation, we stabilize ferromagnetic (FM) short-range interactions within the original short-range AFM system, creating magnetic frustration within the system beyond that induced from the MLL geometrically frustrated structure, leading to a spin-glass state. Magnetic and structural analyses, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, demonstrate the near-degeneracy between AFM and FM configurations in Na2Mn3O7, suggesting that the altered lattice distortions and disorder introduced via deintercalation are responsible for the frustrated magnetism. Our findings provide a novel platform for studying low-dimensional magnetism, spin glass behavior, and potential applications in spintronics and computing technologies. This study represents the first observation of an induced spin glass state in MLL materials and is a rare example of electrochemically induced spin glass state, highlighting the critical role of ion intercalation in tuning magnetic interactions.

Abstract: Magneto-nonlinear Hall effect is known to be intrinsic and requires time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that a new type of magneto-nonlinear Hall effect can occur in the time-reversal breaking materials within the second-order response to in-plane electric and vertical magnetic fields. Such a Hall response is generated by the oscillation of the electromagnetic field and has a quantum origin arising from a geometric quantity associated with the Berry curvature and band velocity. We demonstrate that the massive Dirac model of LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 quantum well can be used to detect this Hall effect. Our work widens the theory of the Hall effect in the time-reversal breaking system by proposing a new kind of nonlinear electromagnetic response.

Abstract: We perform a statistical and geometrothermodynamic analysis of three different models of magnetic materials, namely, the translational free model, the spin model, and the mean-field model. First, we derive the fundamental equation for each model, which is then used as input to compute the metrics of the corresponding equilibrium spaces. Analyzing the corresponding geometrothermodynamic curvatures, we conclude that they can be used to describe thermodynamic interaction, stability conditions, and the phase transition structure of the modeled substances. In all the cases, we reproduce their well-known behavior close to the Curie temperature. Moreover, in the case of the model with spin, we found a curvature singularity which corresponds to a novel transition, where a particular response function diverges, indicating the presence of a second order phase transition, according to Ehrenfest classification.

Abstract: The energy-momentum dispersion of magnons, as collective low-energy excitations of magnetic material, is computed from an effective quantum spin Hamiltonian but simplified via linearized Holstein-Primakoff transformations to describe noninteracting magnons. The dispersion produced by such linear spin wave theory (LSWT) is then plotted as ``sharp bands'' of infinitely long-lived quasiparticles. However, magnons are prone to many-body interactions with other quasiparticles -- such as electrons, phonons or other magnons -- which can lead to shifting (i.e., band renormalization) and broadening of ``sharp bands'' as the signature of finite quasiparticle lifetime. The magnon-magnon interactions can be particularly important in antiferromagnets (AFs), and, therefore, possibly in newly classified altermagnets sharing many features of collinear AFs. Here, we employ nonperturbative quantum many-body calculations, via time-dependent matrix product states (TDMPS), to obtain magnon spectral function for RuO$_2$ altermagnet whose effective quantum spin Hamiltonian is put onto 4-leg cylinder. Its upper band is shifted away from upper ``sharp band'' of LSWT, as well as broadened, which is explained as the consequence of {\em hybridization} of the latter with three-magnon continuum. This implies that two-magnon Raman scattering spectra {\em cannot} be computed from LSWT bands, which offers a litmus test for the relevance of magnon-magnon interactions. Finally, we employ atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, based on classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, to obtain magnon spectrum at finite temperature and/or at a fraction of the cost of TDMPS calculations. Despite including magnon-magnon interactions via nonlinearity of LLG equation, ASD simulations {\em cannot} match the TDMPS-computed magnon spectrum, thereby signaling {\em nonclassical} effects harbored by AFs and altermagnets.

Abstract: Static or frozen disorder, characterised by spatial heterogeneities, influences diverse complex systems, encompassing many-body systems, equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter, intricate network topologies, biological systems, and wave-matter interactions. While static disorder has been thoroughly examined, delving into evolving disorder brings increased intricacy to the issue. An example of this complexity is the observation of stochastic acceleration of electromagnetic waves in evolving media, where noisy fluctuations in the propagation medium transfer effective momentum to the wave. Here, we investigate elastic wave propagation in a one-dimensional heterogeneous medium with diagonal disorder. We examine two types of complex elastic materials: one with static disorder, where mass density randomly varies in space, and the other with evolving disorder, featuring random variations in both space and time. Our results indicate that evolving disorder enhances the propagation speed of Gaussian pulses compared to static disorder. Additionally, we demonstrate that the enhanced speed effect also occurs when the medium evolves chaotically rather than randomly over time. The latter establishes that evolving randomness is not a unique prerequisite for observing the enhanced transport of wavefronts, introducing the concept of chaotic speed enhancement of waves in complex media.

Abstract: To develop new devices based on synthetic ferrimagnetic heterostructures, understanding the material's physical properties is pivotal. Here, the induced magnetic moment (IMM), magnetic exchange coupling, and spin textures are investigated in Pt(1 nm)/Co(1.5 nm)/Gd(1 nm) multilayers using a multiscale approach. The magnitude and direction of the IMM are interpreted in the framework of both X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and density functional theory. The IMM transferred by Co across the Gd paramagnetic thickness leads to a nontrivial flipped spin state (FSS) within the Gd layers, in which their magnetic moments couple antiparallel/parallel with the ferromagnetic Co near/far from the Co/Gd interface, respectively. The FSS depends on the magnetic field, which, on average, reduces the Gd magnetic moment as the field increases. For the Pt, in both Pt/Co and Gd/Pt interfaces, the IMM follows the same direction as the Co magnetic moment, with negligible IMM in the Gd/Pt interface. Additionally, zero-field spin spirals were imaged using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, whereas micromagnetic simulations were employed to unfold the interactions, stabilizing the ferrimagnetic configurations, where the existence of a sizable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is demonstrated to be crucial.

Abstract: Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions of vacancy quasispins.

Such spin configuration can be stabilized by pinning the spin orientations of the surfaces. \textcolor{blue}{Furthermore, via tuning the on-site orbital energy and vertical electric fields, we find rich QAHE phases with tunable Chern number of $|\mathcal{C}|=1, 2, 3$. In addition, we reveal that the edge states are layer-selective and primarily locate at the boundaries of the bottom and top layers. Our work not only proposes a scheme to realize Chern number tunable QAHE in antiferromagnets without net spin magnetization, but also provides a platform for layer-selective dissipationless transport devices.

Abstract: We study the effect of competing interactions on ensemble inequivalence. We consider a one-dimensional Ising model with ferromagnetic mean-field interactions and short-range nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings which can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. Despite the relative simplicity of the model, our calculations in the microcanonical ensemble reveal a rich phase diagram. The comparison with the corresponding phase diagram in the canonical ensemble shows the presence of phase transition points and lines which are different in the two ensembles. As an example, in a region of the phase diagram where the canonical ensemble shows a critical point and a critical end point, the microcanonical ensemble has an additional critical point and also a triple point. The regions of ensemble inequivalence typically occur at lower temperatures and at larger absolute values of the competing couplings. The presence of two free parameters in the model allows us to obtain a fourth-order critical point, which can be fully characterized by deriving its Landau normal form.

Abstract: Quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a new and promising material platform for realizing topological Kitaev chains. So far, experiments have implemented a two-site chain with limited protection. Here we propose an experimentally feasible protocol for scaling up the chain in order to enhance the protection of the Majorana zero modes. To this end, we make use of the fact that the relative sign of normal and superconducting hoppings mediated by an Andreev bound state can be changed by electrostatic gates. In this way, our method only relies on the use of individual electrostatic gates on hybrid regions, quantum dots, and tunnel barriers, respectively, without the need for individual magnetic flux control, greatly simplifying the device design. Our work provides guidance for realizing a topologically protected Kitaev chain, which is the building block of error-resilient topological quantum computation.

Abstract: The properties and experimental identification of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) remain an important topic with many fundamental questions. Here, we explore the dynamics of a single charge dopant (hole) in a $t$-$J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ model on a square lattice, which realizes a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL at half filling. Using a field theory approach based on the parton construction, which includes an infinite number of scatterings between the low-energy quasiparticle excitations of the QSL via a self-consistent Born approximation, we calculate both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of the hole for weak and strong interactions. Quasiparticle branches as well as stringlike excitations of the holon are identified, and we furthermore explore the time-dependent spreading of a hole throughout the QSL after it has been injected at a given lattice site. The final ballistic expansion speed is shown to exhibit a nonmonotonic behavior as a quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic and the QSL phase is crossed, which is caused by a qualitative change in the fundamental kinematics of the interactions between the hole and the surrounding spins. Our results demonstrate how charge dopants can be used as a quantum probe for QSLs and are directly relevant to optical lattice experiments with single site resolution.

Abstract: Rich spontaneous symmetry-breaking phenomena with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. In this context, the emergence of chiral loop-current order, accompanied by time-reversal symmetry-symmetry breaking in various kagome metals, has garnered significant attention. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) in CsV3Sb5, which provides compelling evidence of time-reversal-symmetry and inversion-symmetry breakings. However, the underlying essence of this observation has remained obscured due to the lack of theoretical understanding. Here, we reveal that the loop-current order causes giant and reversible eMChA coefficient, $\gamma_{eM}$, is proportional to the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ times the lifetime of conduction electrons $\tau$. In kagome metals, the derived $\gamma_{eM}$ is substantial and reversible by minute magnetic fields, due to the large $\tau (\gg a_0/v_{Fermi})$ and the field-induced reversal of $M_{orb}$. By considering the experimentally observed stripe charge-density wave, the loop-current state becomes non-centrosymmetric, thereby giving rise to the eMChA. Surprisingly, the quantum-metric, which defines a fundamental geometric aspect of Bloch wavefunctions, acquires significant momentum dependence in the loop-current phase, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of eMChA by $\sim100$ times. This research not only clarifies the fundamental symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals, but also opens a new path for exploring quantum-metric-induced phenomena arising from exotic quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated metals

Abstract: This work investigates a system of three entangled qubits within the XXX model, subjected to an external magnetic field in the $z$-direction and incorporating an anisotropy term along the $y$-axis. We explore the thermodynamics of the system by calculating its magnetic susceptibility and analyzing how this quantity encodes information about entanglement. By deriving rigorous bounds for susceptibility, we demonstrate that their violation serves as an entanglement witness. Our results show that anisotropy enhances entanglement, extending the temperature range over which it persists. Additionally, by tracing over the degrees of freedom of two qubits, we examine the reduced density matrix of the remaining qubits and find that its entropy under the influence of the magnetic field can be mapped to an effective thermal bath at $(B,K) > 0$ K.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamic behavior of spin reversal events in the dilute Ising model, focusing on the influence of static disorder introduced by pinned spins. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that in a homogeneous, defect-free system, the inter-event time (IET) between local spin flips follows an exponential distribution, characteristic of Poissonian processes. However, in heterogeneous systems where defects are present, we observe a significant departure from this behavior. At high temperatures, the IET exhibits a power-law distribution resulting from the interplay of spins located in varying potential environments, where defect density influences reversal probabilities. At low temperatures, all site classes converge to a unique power-law distribution, regardless of their potential, leading to distinct critical exponents for the high- and low-temperature regimes. This transition from exponential to power-law behavior underscores the critical response features of magnetic systems with defects, suggesting analogies to glassy dynamics. Our findings highlight the complex mechanisms governing spin dynamics in disordered systems, with implications for understanding the universal aspects of relaxation in glassy materials.

Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field with the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. This expression is in disagreement with what was predicted in semi-classical scenarios, which neglect Landau quantization. We argue that the classical/quantum crossover occurs at accessible magnetic fields for states whose Fermi wave-vector is almost parallel to the magnetic field. As a consequence, the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement give rise to oscillations with a periodicity identical to the semi-classical one. A rigorous theoretical account of our data is missing.

Abstract: In 1977, G\'erard Toulouse has proposed a new concept termed as "frustration" in spin systems. Using this definition, several frustrated models have been created and studied, among them we can mention the Villain's model, the fully frustrated simple cubic lattice, the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice. The former models are systems with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, while in the latter containing only an antiferromagnetic interaction, the frustration is caused by the lattice geometry. These frustrated spin systems have novel properties that we will review in this paper. One of the striking aspects is the fact that well-established methods such as the renormalization group fail to deal with the nature of the phase transition in frustrated systems. Investigations of properties of frustrated spin systems have been intensive since the 80's. I myself got involved in several investigations of frustrated spin systems soon after my PhD. I have learned a lot from numerous discussions with G\'erard Toulouse. Until today, I am still working on frustrated systems such as skyrmions. In this review, I trace back a number of my works over the years on frustrated spin systems going from exactly solved 2D Ising frustrated models, to XY and Heisenberg 2D and 3D frustrated lattices. At the end I present my latest results on skyrmions resulting from the frustration caused by the competition between the exchange interaction and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction under an applied magnetic field. A quantum spin-wave theory using the Green's function method is shown and discussed.

Abstract: Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize the quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth spin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground for exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$ ions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large spin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles calculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing and controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: The skyrmion lattice (SkL) in MnSi was studied using small-angle neutron scattering and under the influence of a radial electric current in a Corbino geometry. In response to the applied current, the SkL undergoes an angular reorientation with respect to the MnSi crystal lattice. The reorientation is non-monotonic with increasing current, with the SkL rotating first in one direction and then the other. The SkL reorientation was studied at different sample locations and found to depend on the local current density as inferred from a finite element analysis. The non-monotonic response indicates the presence of two competing effects on the SkL, most likely due to the presence of both radial electric and thermal currents. Such a scenario is supported by micromagnetic simulations, which show how these effects can act constructively or destructively to drive the SkL rotation, depending on the direction of the electric current. In addition, the simulations also suggest how the direction of the skyrmion flow may affect the SkL orientation.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.

Abstract: One of the cornerstones of spintronics is the application of a spin-transfer torque to a nanomagnet, driving the magnetization of the nanomagnet into a steady-state precession and realizing a spin-torque oscillator. Such a steady state, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a textbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical descriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here, based on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which allows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the absence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not allowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin relaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin relaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization dynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent precessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation causes a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied voltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and study the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of understanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.

Abstract: We report new magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K, a factor of three lower than those previously reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical to a quantum spin liquid regime. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice.

Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.

Abstract: Space-time modulation of electromagnetic parameters offers novel exciting possibilities for advanced field manipulations. In this study, we explore wave scattering from a time-varying interface characterized by a Lorentz-type dispersion with a step-like temporal variation in its parameters. Our findings reveal a new process: an unconventional frequency generation at the natural resonances of the system. Remarkably, this phenomenon enables the coupling of propagating waves to evanescent ones, allowing the direct far-field excitation of surface-wave modes without the mediation of spatial gratings or prisms. These results suggest a novel strategy for designing compact and ultra-fast photonic devices, eliminating the necessity for subwavelength spatial structuring or prolonged temporal modulations.

Abstract: The Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) is a fundamental tool in magnetometry, pivotal for advancing research in optics, magnetism, and spintronics as a direct probe of magnetization. Traditional MOKE measurements primarily detect the magnetization components parallel to the Poynting vector, which can only access the magnitude but not the direction of the orthogonal component. In this study, we introduce an orthogonal MOKE geometry in which the Kerr signal detects both the magnitude and direction of the magnetization component perpendicular to the Poynting vector. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this orthogonal geometry through the MOKE measurements in cubic ferromagnets and van der Waals ferromagnet. We theoretically show that the orthogonal MOKE geometry is enabled by the multipolar structure of Berry curvature in the magnetization space, which generally induces a Voigt vector orthogonal to the magnetization, thereby accounting for the unique magnetization angle dependence distinct from conventional MOKE. The establishment of the orthogonal MOKE geometry not only introduces a new paradigm for magneto-optical measurements but also provides a framework for exploring the magnetization multipoles of Berry curvature across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Abstract: Magnon blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon for generating single-magnon state, which gradually becomes one of the candidates for quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to generate the magnon blockade in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG micromagnet and a skyrmion. Considering weak probing of the magnon and driving of the skyrmion qubit, the second-order correlation function is analytically derived, and the optimal condition for realizing the magnon blockade is identified. Under the optimal condition, we systematically analyze the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under different parameter regimes. Our analysis shows that with appropriate driving and probing field intensities, the magnon blockade effect can be significantly enhanced, effectively suppressing multi-magnon states and facilitating the generation of high-purity single-magnon states exhibiting pronounced antibunching. Furthermore, we explore the physical mechanisms underlying the magnon blockade, revealing the coexistence and interplay of conventional and unconventional magnon blockade. This scheme provides a versatile all-magnetic platform for generating high purity single-magnon sources.

# Inflation and instabilities of a spherical magnetoelastic balloon

Abstract: This study explores the instabilities during the axisymmetric inflation of an initially spherical magnetoelastic balloon, modeled as a magnetizable Ogden material, under combined internal pressure and a non-uniform magnetic field generated by current-carrying coils. The nonlinear interplay of geometric and material effects leads to governing equations sensitive to bifurcations and instabilities. A coordinate singularity at the poles of the balloon is identified within the system of governing differential equations, which is resolved through an appropriate choice of field variables and L'H\^opital's rule. Stability analysis reveals that as inflation progresses, axisymmetry is broken through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, resulting in a pear-shaped equilibrium. This symmetry is later restored through a reverse subcritical pitchfork bifurcation, forming an isolated loop of pear-shaped solutions containing stable and unstable branches in the case of a six-parameter Ogden material model (SPOM). The onset of symmetry-breaking bifurcations is influenced by material parameters and magnetic field intensity, with critical values beyond which such bifurcations are suppressed. Both symmetry-preserving and pear-shaped configurations are stable under small asymmetric perturbations in both magnetic and non-magnetic cases. Snap-through transitions between pear-shaped and axisymmetric configurations are also observed.

Abstract: This article presents a study on the influence of antenna parameters in medical microwave radiometers on brightness temperature. A series of computational experiments was conducted to analyse the dependence of brightness temperature on antenna characteristics. Various antenna parameters and their effect on the distribution of electromagnetic fields in biological tissues were examined. It was demonstrated that considering the antenna mismatch parameter is crucial when modelling the brightness temperature of biological tissues, contributing about 2 percent to its formation. The depth range of brightness temperature measurement was determined. The dependence of brightness temperature on the antenna diameter and frequency was established. The findings of this study can be applied to improve medical microwave radiometers and enhance their efficiency in the early diagnosis of various diseases.

Abstract: We consider `off-axis' electromagnetic wave propagation down the homogeneous direction of a low-loss two-dimensional periodic dielectric (or photonic crystal fibre) near the light line of the low-dielectric material constituent. Numerous physical and numerical experiments demonstrate the presence of photonic band gaps in the vicinity of this `critical' light line. We mathematically analyse the existence of photonic band gaps near the line and characterise them in terms of frequency gaps in the spectrum of the Maxwell equations restricted to the line. We apply the results to both one-dimensional photonic crystal fibres, and a genuinely two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres with `thin' inclusions, namely ``ARROW'' fibres. In the case of ARROW fibres, by an asymptotic analysis, in terms of the small inclusion parameter, we demonstrate the existence of low frequency photonic band gaps.

Abstract: Integrating 2D materials into on-chip photonic devices holds significant potential for nonlinear frequency conversion across various applications. The lack of inversion symmetry in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), such as MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$, is particularly attractive for enabling nonlinear phenomena based on $\chi^{(2)}$ in silicon photonic devices incorporated with these materials. Previous studies have demonstrated second-order nonlinearities in on-chip silicon-based devices integrated with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, they have largely overlooked the nonlinear modal interaction that considers both the tensorial nature of the TMD's second-order susceptibility and the full vectorial nature of the electromagnetic fields. In this work, we investigate second-harmonic generation (SHG) in silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides integrated with a monolayer of MoS$_2$. We experimentally observed an enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) in MoS$_2$-loaded waveguides compared to those without the monolayer. Notably, this enhancement occurred even when the primary electric field component of the pump and/or signal mode was orthogonal to the TMD plane, highlighting co- and cross-polarized SHG interactions. This phenomenon cannot be predicted by the traditionally used scalar models.In addition, we provide important guidelines for the design of MoS$_2$-loaded waveguides, taking into account phase-matching, interaction length and the MoS$_2$ crystal orientation with respect to the waveguide axis.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of space-time non-diffracting wavepackets, commonly known as light bullets, in a spatiotemporally varying medium. We show that by spatiotemporal refraction, a monochromatic focused beam can be converted to a light bullet that propagates at a given velocity. By further designing the index profile of the spatiotemporal boundary, the group velocity and the propagation direction of the light bullet can be engineered in a programmable way. All effects mentioned above cannot be achieved by spatial or temporal boundaries, and are only possible with spatiotemporal boundaries. These findings provide unique ways to engineer the dynamics of electromagnetic wavepackets in space-time. Such wavepackets with engineered spacetime trajectories may find potential applications in the spatiotemporal control of material properties or particles, or for use as a way to emulate relativistic physics in the laboratory.

Abstract: The minimalist approach in the study of perturbations in fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics involves describing their evolution in the linear regime using a single first-order ordinary differential equation, dubbed principal equation. The dispersion relation is determined by requiring that the solution of the principal equation be continuous and satisfy specific boundary conditions for each problem. The formalism is presented for flows in cartesian geometry and applied to classical cases such as the magnetosonic and gravity waves, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. For the latter, we discuss the influence of compressibility and the magnetic field, and also derive analytical expressions for the growth rates and the range of instability in the case of two fluids with the same characteristics.

Abstract: Aqueous humor (AH) dynamics is responsible for maintaining intraocular pressure, ocular health and targeted drug delivery within the eye. This study investigates the flow of AH within the anterior chamber (AC) under the combined influence of a uniform magnetic field and natural convection. Different orientations of the magnetic field and temperaature gradient are considered. A lubrication approximation is employed and the resulting equations are solved using regular perturbation method. The analytical solutions are validated using numerical simulations performed in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2. In the standing position, AH flow field is characterised by a single vortex, while in the supine position, it forms two counter-rotating vortices. The velocity is found to be higher in standing position. The effect of a uniform magnetic field on the velocity is more significant in the supine position. The magnetic field does not change the flow field qualitatively as buoyancy is the primary driving force. In the standing position a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the eye resulted in a greatest reduction of AH velocity, as compared to a magnetic field along the eye. This study is a step towards holistic approach for targeted drug delivery using magnetic fields in eye.

Abstract: Skyrmions, merons, bimerons, and skyrmionic hopfions are quasiparticles which have stable topological textures. They have been observed across multiple physical domains including nucleons, water waves, magnetic materials, electromagnetic fields, condensed-matter physics, liquid crystals, and Bose-Einstein condensates. The nontrivial topological texture of these quasiparticles exhibited promising applications across several research fields including cosmology, particle physics, superfluids, high-energy physics, optics, condensed matter, early-universe cosmology, cold quantum matter, and liquid crystals. These quasiparticles have most recently been observed in paraxial vector beams. Due to the inhomogeneous polarization distribution of vector beams, the quasiparticle textures reside in the Stokes vector fields. Here, we review recent developments in paraxial quasiparticle research and provide detailed information on their fundamental properties and future prospects. We discuss various techniques which have been used to experimentally generate these quasiparticles and we examine a number of their proposed applications. Notably, this review offers insight into the concepts and techniques which can be applied to the generation of optical skyrmions in paraxial laser beams, and investigates their intriguing applications across both fundamental and applied optics.

Abstract: Microwave superconducting resonators are extensively studied in fields such as quantum computing and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. However, the integration of superconducting resonators with feedback mechanisms to create ultra-low noise oscillators is a relatively unexplored area, and the application of such oscillators in ESR spectroscopy has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we report the design, fabrication, and application of microwave oscillators based on superconducting resonators for ESR spectroscopy. Specifically, ESR spectra are obtained by measuring the oscillator's frequency shift induced by the ESR effect as a function of the applied static magnetic field. The oscillators are composed of a single heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) or high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) coupled with NbTi or YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) superconducting resonators. The fabricated oscillators operate at frequencies of 0.6 and 1.7 GHz and temperatures up to 80 K (for YBCO resonators) and 8 K (for NbTi resonators). The lowest measured frequency noise is about 9 mHz/Hz$^{1/2}$, the best spin sensitivity is about $1\times10^{10}$ spins/Hz$^{1/2}$, and the best concentration sensitivity is about $3\times10^{18}$ spins/Hz$^{1/2}$m$^3$. The approach proposed in this work should allow for significantly better spin and concentration sensitivities compared to those achievable with normal conductors, up to operating frequencies, magnetic fields, and temperatures where superconductors exhibit substantially lower effective microwave resistance than normal conductors.

Abstract: Lead telluride is an important thermoelectric material due to its large Seebeck coefficient combined with its unusually low thermal conductivity that is related to the strong anharmonicity of phonons in this material. Here, we have studied the resonant and nonperturbative coupling of transverse optical phonons in lead telluride with cavity photons inside small-mode-volume metallic metasurface cavities that have photonic modes with terahertz frequencies. We observed a giant vacuum Rabi splitting on the order of the bare phonon and cavity frequencies. Through terahertz time-domain spectroscopy experiments, we systematically studied the vacuum Rabi splitting as a function of sample thickness, temperature, and cavity length. Under the strongest light-matter coupling conditions, the strength of coupling exceeded the bare phonon and cavity frequencies, putting the system into the deep-strong coupling regime. These results demonstrate that this uniquely tunable platform is promising for realizing and understanding predicted cavity-vacuum-induced ferroelectric instabilities and exploring applications of light-matter coupling in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes in quantum technology.

Abstract: Poisson's equation for the magnetic scalar potential generated by a magnetized cylindrical slice and a full cylinder is solved analytically and a closed-form solution for the magnetic scalar potential is determined. This is given in terms of elliptic integrals of the first, second and third kind. We show that the magnetic scalar potential can be written as a demagnetization vector, containing all the geometric information of generating cylinder, multiplied with the magnetization. We validate the derived analytical expression for the magnetic scalar potential by comparing with a finite element simulation and show that these agree perfectly for both the cylindrical slice and the full cylinder.

Abstract: The solar wind affects the plasma environment around all solar system bodies. A strong solar wind dynamic pressure pushes plasma boundaries closer to these objects. For small objects kinetic effects on scales smaller than an ion gyroradius play an important role, and species with various mass-per-charge may act differently. In this case the solar wind composition can be important. Protons are the dominant ion species in the solar wind; however, sometimes the density of alpha particles increases significantly. We analyse the effect of different solar wind alpha-to-proton ratios on the plasma boundaries of the induced cometary magnetosphere. In addition, we investigate the energy transfer between the solar wind ions, the cometary ions, and the electromagnetic fields. Using the hybrid model Amitis, we simulate two different alpha-to-proton ratios and analyse the resulting plasma structures. We calculate the power density (E.J) of all three ion species (solar wind protons and alphas, and cometary ions) to identify load and generator regions. The integrated 1D power density shows the evolution of the power density from the upstream solar wind to downstream of the nucleus. A higher alpha-to-proton ratio leads to a larger comet magnetosphere but weaker magnetic field pile-up. The protons transfer energy to the fields and the cometary ions in the entire upstream region and the pile-up layer. Upstream of the nucleus, alphas are inefficient in transferring energy and can act as a load, especially for low alpha-to-proton ratios. The transfer of energy from alphas to cometary ions happens further downstream due to their larger inertia. For a multi-species solar wind the mass loading and energy transfer upstream of the pile-up layer will be most efficient for the species with the lowest inertia, typically protons, since different ion gyroradii give different flow patterns for the individual species.

arXiv:2501.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective Reflection (SR) spectroscopy of the $6s$ $^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow$ $7p$ $^2P_{3/2}$ electric dipole transition of Cesium ($\lambda~=~456$ nm) is performed for the first time using a nanometric-thin cell ($L=50 - 1500$~nm). We succesfully form narrow resonances corresponding to the $F_g = 3,4 \rightarrow F_e =2,3,4,5$ hyperfine transitions. All transitions are well spectrally resolved and the geometry of the cell allows us to obtain a strong 30 times narrowing of the Doppler width with a single beam pass. For lower thicknesses ($L < 400$~nm), we observe a red shift of the \ac{SR} lines which we attribute to atom-surface interactions, and provide estimates of the $C_3$ interaction coefficient. The SR signal reaches several percent of the incident radiation up to a saturation intensity of 100 mW/cm$^2$. SR is a convenient tool for laser spectroscopy of the hyperfine structure of atoms as well as for the study of Zeeman transitions in magnetic fields. Experimental measurements are in good agreement with theoretical calculations.

Abstract: We discuss the inclusion of the process of multiple ionization of atoms in high-intensity electromagnetic fields into particle-in-cell (PIC) codes applied to the simulation of laser-plasma interactions. The approach is based on the application of the Perelomov-Popov-Terent'yev formulas for ionization rates within the paradigm of sequential tunnel ionization. We analyze difficulties and possible inconsistencies of the approach, which may cause problems in the implementation of PIC codes. To test the sensitivity to the ionization model variations, we perform simulations of an argon target ionization by an incident high-intensity laser pulse. For this, we implement an original procedure in PIC code SMILEI, which allows us to account for the dependence on the magnetic quantum number in ionization rates consistently, and also include barrier suppression at high fields.

arXiv:2501.11722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of a study of the dynamics of atomic moments alignment in cesium under optical pumping by linearly polarized resonant light in a transverse magnetic field are presented. It is shown that there are alignment components whose relaxation does not depend on spin-exchange broadening. The effect of suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in zero magnetic fields is detected, which is similar in its manifestations to the SERF (Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free) effect observed in orientation signals. This observation is interesting from the standpoint of general theory, since the law of conservation of angular momentum responsible for maintaining orientation in the SERF mode should not guarantee the preservation of alignment under the same conditions. A comparison with theoretically calculated parameters of SERF resonances in orientation is given. A qualitative explanation of the observed effect is presented.

Abstract: We reveal a nonlinear magnetic dynamo in a Taylor-Couette flow at small magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pm\leq 1$, which has been previously believed to exist only at higher $Pm\gtrsim 10$ in this flow. Both the amplitude of initial perturbations and $Pm$ play a critical role in its onset and evolution. It is shown that this dynamo exists in two main states -- a weak state dominated by large-scale modes and a strong, more turbulent state with higher amplitude dominated by small-scale modes. These findings can be important for dynamo processes in many astrophysical settings with small $Pm$.

# The gyrokinetic field invariant and electromagnetic temperature-gradient instabilities in `good-curvature' plasmas

arXiv:2501.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curvature-driven instabilities are ubiquitous in magnetised fusion plasmas. By analysing the conservation laws of the gyrokinetic system of equations, we demonstrate that the well-known spatial localisation of these instabilities to regions of `bad magnetic curvature' can be explained using the conservation law for a sign-indefinite quadratic quantity that we call the `gyrokinetic field invariant'. Its evolution equation allows us to define the local effective magnetic curvature whose sign demarcates the regions of `good' and `bad' curvature, which, under some additional simplifying assumptions, can be shown to correspond to the inboard (high-field) and outboard (low-field) sides of a tokamak plasma, respectively. We find that, given some reasonable assumptions, electrostatic curvature-driven modes are always localised to the regions of bad magnetic curvature, regardless of the specific character of the instability. More importantly, we also deduce that any mode that is unstable in the region of good magnetic curvature must be electromagnetic in nature. As a concrete example, we present the magnetic-drift mode, a novel good-curvature electromagnetic instability, and compare its properties with the well-known electron-temperature-gradient instability. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the magnetic-drift mode for high-$\beta$ fusion plasmas, and in particular its relationship with microtearing modes.

Abstract: The propagation of laser pulses in tapered magnetized plasma channels is analyzed using the fluid theory of cold plasmas. This study focuses on laser propagation's key instabilities: forward Raman scattering and self-modulation instability. The influence of plasma density, laser intensity, dc magnetic field strength, and laser polarization on the growth rates of these instabilities is thoroughly examined. Analytical and numerical computations of the number of e-foldings for forward Raman scattering are performed to quantify its impact. The results reveal that increased plasma density and laser intensity significantly enhance the growth rates of these instabilities, leading to amplified Raman-scattered wave intensity and modulation of the laser envelope. Moreover, the strength of the dc magnetic field plays a pivotal role: it boosts instability growth rates for right-handed circularly polarized laser pulses while suppressing them for left-handed circularly polarized pulses. These findings highlight that reducing the growth rates of instabilities can facilitate the stable propagation of laser pulses in tapered plasma channels.

Abstract: In the present study, the generation of THz radiation through wakefield excitation in a cylindrical dielectric plasma waveguide is investigated. The proposed hybrid dielectric-plasma wakefield structure combines the advantages of dielectric materials and plasma, creating a versatile platform for high-performance applications and advanced THz radiation generation. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, this hybrid configuration achieves enhanced gradients and optimized THz wave output. The mechanism involves a high-energy laser pulse propagating through a plasma-loaded dielectric waveguide, inducing wakefields that drive THz wave emission. This dual capability underscores the versatility of the proposed structure, offering significant advancements in THz wave generation technologies. To support the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations were employed using the Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) method and the COMSOL Multiphysics package. The simulation modeled the wakefield generation process and validated the propagation of electromagnetic waves. A comprehensive parametric study examined the effects of various parameters including dielectric thickness, an external DC magnetic field, laser pulse length, driver beam radius, and total current, on the wakefield generated THz radiation. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the study aims to elucidate the controlled features of the resulting fields and optimize THz radiation.

Abstract: Micro-electro-mechanical resonators employing a magnetic element have been proposed for magnetic field sensing applications, but the integration of magnetic materials with standard semiconductor compounds is challenging and requires complex fabrication protocols. We present a different approach relying on (La0.7,Sr0.3)MnO3 (LSMO), an oxide compound that works both as structural element for the resonator and functional magnetic layer. Suspended trampolines are realized in a single step process from LSMO thin films and show quality factor up to 60k and fQ products reaching 10$^{10}$ Hz. Their magnetic properties are probed by a SQUID magnetometer and magnetic force microscopy, showing saturation magnetization of 240 kA/m at room temperature and in-plane magnetic domains with coercivity of 2.5 mT. Being entirely made from a magnetic material, these resonators exhibit a larger magnetic interaction volume compared to other solutions, making them ideal candidates as building blocks for high-sensitivity magnetic field sensors.

**Authors:** Axel Brandenburg, Longqing Yi, Xianshu Wu

arXiv:2501.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful lasers may in future produce magnetic fields that would allow us to study turbulent magnetohydrodynamic inverse cascade behavior. This has so far only been seen in numerical simulations. In the laboratory, however, the produced fields may be highly anisotropic. Here, we present corresponding simulations to show that, during the turbulent decay, such a magnetic field undergoes spontaneous isotropization. As a consequence, we find the decay dynamics to be similar to that in isotropic turbulence. We also find that an initially pointwise nonhelical magnetic field is unstable and develops magnetic helicity fluctuations that can be quantified by the Hosking integral. It is a conserved quantity that characterizes magnetic helicity fluctuations and governs the turbulent decay when the mean magnetic helicity vanishes. As in earlier work, the ratio of the magnetic decay time to the Alfv\'en time is found to be around $50$ in the helical and nonhelical cases. At intermediate times, the ratio can even reach a hundred. This ratio determines the endpoints of cosmological magnetic field evolution.

Abstract: Implosions of magnetically-driven annular shells (Z pinches) are studied in the laboratory to produce high-energy-density plasmas. Such plasmas have a wide-range of applications including x-ray generation, controlled thermonuclear fusion, and astrophysics studies. In this work, we theoretically investigate the in-flight dynamics of a magnetically-driven, imploding cylindrical shell that stagnates onto itself upon collision on axis. The converging flow of the Z-pinch is analyzed by considering the implosion trajectory in the $(A, M)$ parametric plane, where $A$ is the in-flight aspect ratio and $M$ is the implosion Mach number. For an ideal implosion in the absence of instabilities and in the limit of $A\gg1$, we derive asymptotic scaling laws for hydrodynamic quantities evaluated at stagnation (e.g., density, temperature, and pressure) and for performance metrics (e.g., soft x-ray emission, K-shell x-ray emission, and neutron yield) as functions of target-design parameters.

Abstract: The precise control of nuclear spin states is crucial for a wide range of quantum technology applications. Here, we propose a fast and robust single qubit gate in $^{87}$Sr, utilizing the concept of optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER). ONER exploits the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient generated by its electronic environment, enabling spin level transitions via amplitude-modulated laser light. We investigate the hyperfine structure of the 5s$^2$ $^1S_{0}\rightarrow{}$ 5s5p $^3P_1$ optical transition in neutral $^{87}$Sr, and identify the magnetic field strengths and laser parameters necessary to drive spin transitions between the $m_I$ = -9/2 and $m_I$ = -5/2 hyperfine levels in the ground state. Our simulations show that ONER could enable faster spin operations compared to the state-of-the-art oscillations in this 'atomic qubit'. Moreover, we show that the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing can be surpassed even in the presence of typical noise sources. These results pave the way for significant advances in nuclear spin control, opening new possibilities for quantum memories and other quantum technologies.

Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), a hallmark of time-reversal symmetry breaking, has been reported in rutile RuO2, a debated metallic altermagnetic candidate. Previously, AHE in RuO2 was observed only in strain-relaxed thick films under extremely high magnetic fields (~50 T). Yet, in ultrathin strained films with distinctive anisotropic electronic structures, there are no reports, likely due to disorder and defects suppressing metallicity thus hindering its detection. Here, we demonstrate that ultrathin, fully-strained 2 nm TiO2/t nm RuO2/TiO2 (110) heterostructures, grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, retain metallicity and exhibit a sizeable AHE at a significantly lower magnetic field (< 9 T). Density functional theory calculations reveal that epitaxial strain stabilizes a non-compensated magnetic ground state and reconfigures magnetic ordering in RuO2 (110) thin films. These findings establish ultrathin RuO2 as a platform for strain-engineered magnetism and underscore the transformative potential of epitaxial design in advancing spintronic technologies.

Abstract: Our Sun is an active star expelling dynamic phenomena known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The magnetic field configuration on the Sun and related solar wind structures affect the propagation behavior of CMEs, dominate its transit time and embedded magnetic field properties when impacting Earth. Since the conditions on the Sun constantly change, the impact of CMEs on the different regimes of geospace is quite variable and may differ significantly from event to event. This short review summarizes the different manifestations of CMEs on the Sun, their appearance in interplanetary space, and how CMEs trigger a cascade of reactions as they interact with Earth.

Abstract: The SPARC_LAB facility at the INFN LNF is being upgraded to accommodate a new user facility as part of the SABINA project. It was set up to investigate the feasibility of an ultra-brilliant photoinjector and to perform FEL experiments. The new beamline is equipped with three APPLE-X undulators acting as amplifiers to deliver IR/THz radiation with photon pulses in the ps range, with energy of tens of uJ, and with linear, circular, or elliptical polarization. The APPLE-X guarantees to vary the gap amplitude between the magnets arrays and their relative phase. The entire system has been designed from scratch, and a structural analysis has been carried out. Once they were in Frascati, in collaboration with ENEA, a further investigation campaign was launched on the mechanical, using strain measurements based on optical methods. FBG sensors were suitable for these tests due to their immunity to electromagnetic noise. They consist of a phase grating inscribed in the core of a single-mode fiber, whose Bragg-diffracted light propagates back along the fiber. If bonded to the mechanical structure, they can be used as strain sensors. By following the variations in the scattered spectrum, it is possible to perform strain measurements. Using multiple FBGs applied at selected locations on the undulator, several measurements were while opening and closing the gap or changing the phase, but also by studying the quiescent response as a function of the ambient temperature. The results of these tests show that there is a clear deformation of the structure related to the temperature changes and magnetic forces, but the magnitude of this deformation is well within the tolerances required for the functionality of the undulator since they are compatible or lower with respect to the one calculated with the finite elements methods. The tests confirm the reliability of the mechanical structure.

Abstract: Nitrogen Vacancy diamond nanoparticles (NVNPs) are increasingly integrated with methods for optical detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR), providing new opportunities in magnetic characterization that span the visualization of magnetic fields in microelectronic circuits, environmental sensing and biology. However, only a small number of studies utilize aggregates of NVNPs for surface-wide magnetometry being that spin orientations in aggregate NVNPs are inherently misaligned, precluding their use for proper magnetic field detection compared with expensive monocrystalline diamonds. A postprocessing method for layering NVNPs with aligned NV center orientations can potentially facilitate superior NV magnetometry by allowing sensitive detection combined with simplified probe preparation. We present a novel technology for creating densely stacked monolayers of NVNP with inherent interlayer alignment for sensitive measurement of local magnetic field perturbations in microelectronic traces. We establish spatial characteristics of deposited aggregates and demonstrate their ability to capture magnetic dipoles from conducting microwires via ODMR. Our approach forms a novel accessible protocol that can be used for broad applications in micromagnetometry.

Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr\"odinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.

Abstract: The origin of large-amplitude magnetic field deflections in the solar wind, known as magnetic switchbacks, is still under debate. These structures, which are ubiquitous in the observations made by Parker Solar Probe, likely have their seed in the lower solar corona, where small-scale events driven by magnetic reconnection could provide conditions ripe for either direct or indirect generation. We investigated potential links between in situ measurements of switchbacks and eruptions originating from the clusters of small-scale coronal loops known as coronal bright points to establish whether these eruptions act as precursors to switchbacks. We traced solar wind switchbacks from PSP back to their source regions using the ballistic back-mapping and potential field source surface methods, and analyzed the influence of the source surface height and solar wind propagation velocity on magnetic connectivity. Using EUV images, we combined automated and visual approaches to identify small-scale eruptions in the source regions. We find that the source region connected to the spacecraft varies significantly depending on the source surface height, which exceeds the expected dependence on the solar cycle and cannot be detected via polarity checks. For two corotation periods that are straightforwardly connected, we find a matching level of activity (jets and switchbacks), which is characterized by the hourly rate of events and depends on the size of the region connected to PSP. However, no correlation is found between the two time series of hourly event rates. Modeling constraints and the event selection may be the main limitations in the investigation of a possible correlation. Evolutionary phenomena occurring during the solar wind propagation may also influence our results. These results do not allow us to conclude that the jets are the main switchback precursors, nor do they rule out this hypothesis.

Abstract: The paper provides three main definitions of the Cartesian photon position operator based on: boost generator, the transversality condition and the helicity operator. In each case, the correctness of the definition and Hermitianness of the operator in the domain of physical states are proven. All considered definitions lead to the same form of the Cartesian position operator in the domain of physical states. Radial photon position operators were also defined, but they turned out to be non-equivalent. Nevertheless, the most useful two radial operators turned out to be twin counterparts in the sense of the transformation to the helical representation, which is an alternative positional representation. The components of the photon position operator do not commute, but in analogy to the problem of eigenangular momentum, its eigenstates do exist.
  The eigenstates of the two components of the position operator (including the radial component) are called photon strings. Photon strings on a straight line and on a circle have been studied. The usual, previously known photon string states were named electric strings, but new magnetic strings were also introduced. Exact helical photon strings on a straight line, as well as hybrid helical photon strings on a circle, were also considered. On the other hand, infinitely short photon magnetic strings turned out to be flat photon vortices on planes with a normalization formula looks like as point-localized particles.

Abstract: Planar electromagnetic actuators based on the principle of linear motors are widely employed for micro and nano positioning applications. These actuators usually employ a planar magnetic platform driven by a co-planar electromagnetic coil. While these actuators offer a large motion range and high positioning resolution, their actuation bandwidth is limited due to relatively small electromagnetic stiffness. We report optimization of the design parameters of the electromagnetic coil and the magnetic assembly to maximize the electromagnetic force and stiffness. Firstly, we derive closed-form expressions for the electromagnetic forces and stiffness, which enable us to express these quantities in terms of the design parameters of the actuator. Secondly, based on these derived expressions, we estimate the optimum values of the design parameters to maximize force and stiffness. Notably, for the optimum design parameters, the force and stiffness per unit volume can be increased by two and three orders of magnitude, respectively by reducing the pitch of the electromagnetic coil by a factor of 10. Lastly, we develop an electromagnetic actuator and evaluate its performance using a Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based force sensor. By operating the force sensor in a feedback loop, we precisely measure the generated electromagnetic forces for different design parameters of the actuator. The experimental results obtained align closely with the analytical values, with an error of less than 15%.

Abstract: We present a new model of magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence, applicable when the magnetic helicity is non-zero. The new model differs from the Lazarian-Vishniac turbulent reconnection theory by emphasizing the role of locally coherent magnetic structures, whose existence is shown to be permitted by the properties of magnetic field line separation in turbulent plasma. Local coherence allows storage of magnetic helicity inside the reconnection layer and we argue that helicity conservation produces locally coherent twisted flux ropes. We then introduce the "Alfv\'en horizon" to explain why the global reconnection rate can be governed by locally coherent magnetic field structure instead of by field line wandering, formally extending to 3D the principle that reconnection can be made fast by fragmentation of the global current layer. Coherence is shown to dominate over field line dispersion if the anisotropy of the turbulence at the perpendicular scale matching the thickness of a marginally stable current layer exceeds the aspect ratio of the current layer. Finally, we conjecture that turbulence generated within the reconnection layer may produce a balance of anisotropies that maintains the system in the flux-rope mediated regime. The new model successfully accounts for the major features of 3D numerical simulations of self-generated turbulent reconnection, including reconnection rates of 0.01 in resistive MHD and 0.1 with collisionless physics.

Abstract: We report the first experimental detection of a zero-frequency fluctuation that is pumped by an Alfv\`en mode in a magnetically confined plasma. Core-localized bidirectional Alfv\`en modes of frequency inside the toroidicity-induced gap (and its harmonics) exhibit three-wave coupling interactions with a zero-frequency fluctuation. The observation of the zero-frequency fluctuation is consistent with theoretical and numerical predictions of zonal modes pumped by Alfv\'en modes, and is correlated with an increase in the deep core ion temperature, temperature gradient, and confinement factor $H_{89,P}$. Despite the energetic particle transport induced by the Alfv\`en eigenmodes, the generation of a zero-frequency fluctuation that can suppress the turbulence leads to an overall improvement of confinement.

Abstract: Evolving magnetic fields are frequently embedded in plasmas that are turbulent. When the primary interest is in effects that are on a large scale compared to that of the turbulence, it is desirable to average over the turbulence to obtain equations for mean-field magnetohydrodynamics. An obvious constraint on the validity of the averaging is that large-scale quantities that evolve slowly using the exact evolution equations must remain slowly evolving in the mean-field theory. Magnetic helicity is the primary example of such a quantity and maintaining its slow evolution has proven difficult in mean-field magnetohydrodynamics. A full theory of magnetic reconnection in turbulent plasmas is not the intent of this paper. What is the intent is to show how exact results from Maxwell's equations explain why fast reconnection is so ubiquitous and what constraints these results place on the theory of magnetic field evolution, including dynamos, whether the plasma is turbulent or not. These constraints are commonly broken in the reconnection literature, which has been heavily influenced by two-dimensional theory that is not applicable to three-dimensional problems.

Abstract: Space-time modulation of electromagnetic parameters offers novel exciting possibilities for advanced field manipulations. In this study, we explore wave scattering from a time-varying interface characterized by a Lorentz-type dispersion with a step-like temporal variation in its parameters. Our findings reveal a new process: an unconventional frequency generation at the natural resonances of the system. Remarkably, this phenomenon enables the coupling of propagating waves to evanescent ones, allowing the direct far-field excitation of surface-wave modes without the mediation of spatial gratings or prisms. These results suggest a novel strategy for designing compact and ultra-fast photonic devices, eliminating the necessity for subwavelength spatial structuring or prolonged temporal modulations.

Abstract: Dense lattices of photonic crystals can serve as artificial materials, with light propagation in these structures described by effective material parameters that surpass the capabilities of natural materials. In this study, we introduce a metamaterial that supports quadrupole magnetization, a characteristic rarely observed in existing structures. We experimentally demonstrate a magnetic quadrupole metamaterial associated with Mie-resonance-excited stop bands below the Bragg band. Additionally, we develop a theoretical model that addresses both dispersion and boundary conditions within this framework. Using a Fabry-Perot resonator as a case study, we validate our model and reveal that the quadrupole metamaterial can exhibit a markedly different reflection/transmission spectrum, including zero reflection at normal incidence. Our findings underscore the practical potential for both experimental and theoretical investigations of metamaterials that extend beyond the dipole approximation.

Abstract: The Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) is a fundamental tool in magnetometry, pivotal for advancing research in optics, magnetism, and spintronics as a direct probe of magnetization. Traditional MOKE measurements primarily detect the magnetization components parallel to the Poynting vector, which can only access the magnitude but not the direction of the orthogonal component. In this study, we introduce an orthogonal MOKE geometry in which the Kerr signal detects both the magnitude and direction of the magnetization component perpendicular to the Poynting vector. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this orthogonal geometry through the MOKE measurements in cubic ferromagnets and van der Waals ferromagnet. We theoretically show that the orthogonal MOKE geometry is enabled by the multipolar structure of Berry curvature in the magnetization space, which generally induces a Voigt vector orthogonal to the magnetization, thereby accounting for the unique magnetization angle dependence distinct from conventional MOKE. The establishment of the orthogonal MOKE geometry not only introduces a new paradigm for magneto-optical measurements but also provides a framework for exploring the magnetization multipoles of Berry curvature across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Abstract: MADMAX, an axion dark matter search experiment, is currently in the prototype testing phase. Its working principle is based on the conversion of axions in a magnetic field into photons. This signal is then enhanced by a booster made of dielectric disks placed in front of a mirror. In order to test MADMAX prototypes at cryogenic temperatures in a magnetic field parallel to the disks, a new G-10 glass-fiber cryostat of 0.25 m$^3$ inner volume was designed, tested and used in a CERN magnet. The design allows to minimise cost as well as cooling down and warming up times. Using continuous circulation flow of gaseous helium, the MADMAX prototype was cooled down reproducibly to temperatures below 10 K for more than 24 hours. This procedure allowed, for the first time, to perform a calibration of the booster response and to run a dark matter axion search in a magnetic field at low temperatures. This novel type of cryostat, with a low manufacturing cost, fast and easy to operate, could be used for other purposes beyond MADMAX.

Abstract: Inspired by the concept of relativity of simultaneity used in the theory of special relativity, a new approach is proposed to simulate future solar wind conditions at any point in the inner solar system. An important distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that the simulation in the solar corona is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms and is continuously simulated in nearly real time. The model for the inner heliosphere is based on time transformation to a boosted frame of reverence (or spacetime coordinate system) in which the current state of the solar wind at the solar corona -- inner heliosphere boundary and future states of the solar wind are simultaneous. The predictive capability for tomorrow's parameters of the ambient solar wind at 1 AU is achieved by simulating them simultaneously with the current observations of the solar magnetic field, the time offset being due to the use of boosted frame.
  We derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics and present a new numerical algorithm that solves the modified governing equations. The proposed method enables an efficient numerical implementation and thus a significantly longer forecast time than traditional solution methods. In the numerical test for transient propagation, the boosted solution for the CME-driven shock arrival at 1AU is 16 hours ahead of the solution at the solar corona -- inner heliosphere boundary.

# A rare case of Fetal bilateral Wilms&rsquo; Tumor in horseshoe Kidney: A case report

## 罕见的马蹄肾胎儿双侧肾母细胞瘤1例报告

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5766165/latest

Wilms' tumor is the most common malignant kidney tumor in children. The horseshoe kidney is the most common renal fusion malformation. However, Wilms' tumor is rarely identified in horseshoe kidney patients. The incidence of horseshoe kidney is about 1 in 400 cases. Wilms&amp;rsquo; tumor or Nephrogenic rests can occur in both kidneys, termed bilateral disease, found in only 5&amp;ndash;8% of cases. Management of bilateral Wilms&amp;rsquo; tumor presents a major clinical challenge in terms of maximizing survival, preserving renal function, and understanding underlying genetic risk. Ultrasound is used to diagnose horseshoe kidneys, whereas Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are often used for staging purposes. Here, we present an extremely rare case of a fetus with a prenatal diagnosis of renal mass, and an autopsy found out to be a bilateral congenital Wilms&amp;rsquo; tumor in the horseshoe kidney. Up to our knowledge, it is the first case to be reported from Ethiopia, and there are only a few case reports worldwide.

# Electromagnetic performance analysis of coaxial magnetic gear with three rotors featuring a monotonic magnetic ring and dual modulation enhancement effect

## 具有单调磁环和双调制增强效应的三转子同轴磁齿轮的电磁性能分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5674550/latest

The strength of magnetic field modulation effect of coaxial magnetic gears is a key factor to measure the transmission performance of coaxial magnetic gears. Although the dual modulation coaxial magnetic gears with double modulating magnetic rings can effectively enhance the magnetic field modulation effect, there are still the problems of low torque density and serious magnetic leakage loss. In order to address the above problems, this paper proposes a three-rotor single-regulating ring dual-modulated coaxial magnetic gear that simultaneously adopts the &amp;ldquo;sum modulation effect&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;differential modulation effect&amp;rdquo;, and analyzes its working principle and the structure of multiple magnetic circuits that inhibit magnetic saturation; establishes the corresponding finite element model and analyzes its electromagnetic performance. The finite element model is established and its electromagnetic performance is simulated and analyzed; the results show that the modulation effect of the single-regulating magnetic ring double-modulated coaxial magnetic gear is strong, but the steady-state torque fluctuation of the outer rotor is large. To address this problem, Halbach magnetization is used to suppress the large fluctuations in the torque of the outer rotor, and the torque fluctuation of the outer rotor is reduced by 5.67% after the improvement. The single-modulating magnetic ring dual modulation coaxial three-rotor magnetic gear proposed in this paper enhances the magnetic field modulation effect while suppressing the magnetic saturation phenomenon, improves the utilization rate of permanent magnets, reduces the amount of modulating ring, and provides a reference for the research of single-modulating magnetic ring dual modulation coaxial magnetic gear.
