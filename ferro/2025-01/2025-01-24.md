# How to Measure and Model Light-Induced Spin Transfer

arXiv:2501.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser light can transfer spin angular momentum between magnetic subspecies that exhibit hybridized valence bands within an alloy or compound, and represents the fastest route for manipulating the magnetization of a material. To date, ultrafast spin transfer has predominantly been explained in terms of the initial and final states available for laser excitation. Here, by comparing the measured and calculated dynamics across the entire $M$-edges of two very similar Heusler compounds, $Co_2MnGa$ and $Co_2MnGe$ as well as a sample of elemental Co, we find that simply accounting for the initial and final electron states available for laser excitation cannot alone explain the experimental observations. The influence of spin lifetimes must also be included, due to the shifting of the Fermi level upon replacing Ga with Ge, or the presence of crystalline disorder. This explains why the ordered $L2_1$ phase of $Co_2MnGa$ demonstrates strong laser-induced magnetic signal enhancements across the entire Co-edge, while similar enhancements were not observed in partially disordered $Co_2MnGe$. Although intra-site spin-transfers were expected in the minority channel in pure Co due to the presence of many more available states in the minority channel above the Fermi level, no such signal was observed due to very short few-femtosecond spin lifetimes in a metal. Finally, we identify key regions in the magnetic asymmetry where a transiently enhanced signal could be misinterpreted as a light-induced spin-transfer signature.

Abstract: The frustrated magnet $\alpha$-RuCl3 is one of the prime candidates for realizing a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). However, the existence of a field-induced intermediate QSL phase in this material remains under debate. Here, we employ sign-free numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) model on the honeycomb lattice with $K=-2J$ under an applied magnetic field along the z-direction. Our findings reveal that the system undergoes a direct quantum phase transition from a zigzag magnetically ordered phase to a spin-polarized phase at zero temperature, which belongs to the 3D XY universality class. At finite temperatures, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition line separates the spin-polarized phase from a quasi-long-range ordered state, eventually terminating at the quantum critical point. Our results convincingly show that there is no intermediate QSL phase in the KH model with a z-direction magnetic field, which we believe will shed important light on understanding experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl3.

Abstract: The effect of platinum (Pt) bottom electrode texture on the tetragonality, dielectric, ferroelectric, and polarization switching response of pulsed laser deposited Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 (BST) thin films has been studied. The x-ray diffraction and Raman analysis revealed the higher tetragonality of BST films when they were grown on higher (111) textured Pt layer. The properties like dielectric permittivity, polarization, switching time, and leakage currents were found to be correlated to tetragonality and orientation of the BST films. The polarization current was observed to be higher in BST films on Pt epitaxial layer and it exhibits exponential dependence on the electric field. The voltage-current measurements displayed Ohmic behavior of leakage current irrespective of Pt texture for low voltages (up to 1 V), whereas at higher voltages the conduction mechanism was found to be dependent on texture selection of bottom Pt electrode.

arXiv:2501.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the anti-ferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.

arXiv:2501.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than fifty years ago, excitonic insulators, formed by the pairing of electrons and holes due to Coulomb interactions, were first predicted. Since then, excitonic insulators have been observed in various classes of materials, including quantum Hall bilayers, graphite, transition metal chalcogenides, and more recently in moire superlattices. In these excitonic insulators, an electron and a hole with the same spin bind together and the resulting exciton is a spin singlet. Here, we report the experimental observation of a spin-triplet exciton insulator in the ultra-quantum limit of a three-dimensional topological material HfTe5. We observe that the spin-polarized zeroth Landau bands, dispersing along the field direction, cross each other beyond a characteristic magnetic field in HfTe5, forming the one-dimensional Weyl mode. Transport measurements reveal the emergence of a gap of about 250 {\mu}eV when the field surpasses a critical threshold. By performing the material-specific modeling, we identify this gap as a consequence of a spin-triplet exciton formation, where electrons and holes with opposite spin form bound states, and the translational symmetry is preserved. The system reaches charge neutrality following the gap opening, as evidenced by the zero Hall conductivity over a wide magnetic field range (10 - 72 T). Our finding of the spin-triplet excitonic insulator paves the way for studying novel spin transport including spin superfluidity, spin Josephson currents, and Coulomb drag of spin currents in analogy to the transport properties associated with the layer pseudospin in quantum Hall bilayers.

Abstract: Nanoscrolls, radial superlattices formed by rolling up a nanomembrane, exhibit distinct electronic and magneto-transport properties compared to their flat counterparts. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that the conductance can be precisely enhanced N times by rolling up graphene into an N-turn nanoscroll and applying a longitudinal magnetic field. This tunable positive magnetoconductance stems from the topological winding number which is activated in a carbon nanoscroll with magnetic flux and its maximum value purely increases with the scroll winding number (the number of turns). By integrating material geometry and topology, our work opens the door to artificially creating, customizing, and designing topological materials in rolled-up graphene-like systems.

Abstract: Current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) has emerged as a promising method for achieving energy-efficient magnetization switching in advanced spintronic devices. However, technological advancement has been inadequate because an external in-plane magnetic field is required to attain deterministic switching. Several approaches have been explored to address these challenges. In this work, we explored the potential of a newly emerged altermagnetic material RuO2 in combination with a Pt layer to achieve both field-free and low-power switching concurrently. We leveraged out-of-plane (OOP) spin polarization via the spin-splitter effect (SSE) in RuO2 for field-free switching (FFS) and in-plane spin polarization combined with spin Hall effect (SHE) in Pt for enhanced SOT efficiency. We revealed that the effective OOP magnetic field and FFS can be maximized by tuning the nominal thickness of the Pt underlayer and the direction of the applied current. We observed a significant enhancement in FFS at an optimized Pt thickness of 1.5 nm for an applied current density as low as 2.56e11 A/m2 at a crystal angle of 90 deg. Our study paves the way for energy-efficient spintronics devices for non-volatile memory, logic circuits, and neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Hafnium oxide (HfO2), particularly at low-dimensional scales, exhibits extensive promising applications in ultrahigh density devices like low-power logic and non-volatile memory devices due to its compatibility with current semiconductor technology1-5. However, achieving ferroelectricity (FE) at ultimate scale especially in undoped HfO2 remains challenging as the non-centrosymmetric FE phase, so-called O-III (space group: Pca21) is metastable and FE has a strong tendency of depolarization with the decrease in thickness6. Up to now, this phase has usually stabilized via doping with other elements7-9. But the minimum film thickness is still limited to 1 nm, about 2-unit-cell, to keep FE8. Thinner and undoped films, conducive to further miniature device size and avoid contamination during deposition process, have been a challenge to fabricate on Si substrates. Herein, we report the robust FE observed in undoped HfO2 ultrathin films directly grown on Si substrate via atomic layer deposition (ALD) and post-heat treat in vacuum. The so-fabricated ferroelectric O-III phase contains about 4.48 at% oxygen vacancy, is robust even monoclinic phase (space group: P21/c) coexists. The spontaneous and switchable polarization is remarkably stable, still surviving even in films down to 0.5 nm (one-unit-cell). Our results show the robust FE O-III phase can be obtained in films down to one-unit-cell in thickness on Si, providing a practical way to fabricating this important material in thickness limit.

Abstract: The quantum geometric properties of topological materials underpin many exotic physical phenomena and applications. Quantum nonlinearity has emerged as a powerful probe for revealing these properties. The Berry curvature dipole in nonmagnetic materials and the quantum metric dipole in antiferromagnets have been explored by studying the second-order nonlinear Hall effect. Although the quadrupole moment of the quantum geometric tensor is theoretically predicted to induce higher-order quantum nonlinearity, the quantum metric quadrupole remains experimentally unexplored. Here, we report the quantum metric quadrupole induced third-order nonlinear longitudinal electrical response in few-layer WTe2, persisting up to room temperature. Angle-resolved third-harmonic current-voltage characteristics are found consistent with the intrinsic crystal symmetry of WTe2. Through temperature variation and scaling analysis, we identify the quantum metric quadrupole as the physical origin of the observed third-order longitudinal nonlinearity. Additionally, we determine the angle dependence of the quantum metric quadrupole, establishing third-order nonlinearity as an efficient method for revealing the quantum metric structure.

Abstract: We report the observation of current-modulated magnetoresistance hysteresis below the superconducting transition temperature in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This highly tunable hysteresis behavior is confined to the superconducting state and vanishes when superconductivity is fully suppressed, directly linking magnetoresistance hysteresis to the superconducting order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Additionally, the superconducting diode effect driven by a small magnetic field is observed, indicating the enhanced electronic magnetochiral anisotropy by the chiral domain-wall scattering. Our findings position CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a promising platform for exploring nontrivial physical phenomena, including unconventional pairing mechanisms and topological superconductivity.

**Authors:** Ankita Phutela, Saswata Bhattacharya

arXiv:2501.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are distinguished by zero net magnetic moment, high resistance to external magnetic disturbances, and ultrafast dynamic responses. For advancing AFM materials in spintronic and valleytronic applications, achieving spontaneous valley polarization and the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) is pivotal. We predict an A-type AFM monolayer Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$, which shows a significant spontaneous valley polarization of 157 meV. In Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$, spatial inversion symmetry (P) and time-reversal symmetry (T) are individually broken, yet the combined PT symmetry is preserved. This symmetry conservation leads to spin degeneracy, resulting in zero Berry curvature in the momentum space and absence of AVHE. However, a layer-locked hidden Berry curvature is produced, leading to the observation of the valley layer-spin Hall effect. Further, an external out-of-plane electric field can induce spin splitting by introducing layer-dependent electrostatic potential, enabling the layer-locked AVHE. Additionally, the introduction of a built-in electric field caused by the Janus structure also induces spin splitting in monolayer Fe$_2$C(OH)F due to the electric-potential-difference-AFM mechanism. The high out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and realization of AVHE, offer promising opportunities for next-generation spintronic technologies.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, electrical transport, and magnetic properties of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ ($\it{x}$ = 1.14, 1.18, 1.23, 1.28, and 1.32) to unravel the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition observed in these systems. For this, we systematically evaluated the structural parameters of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ as a function of Se concentration and temperature. We observe increased lattice constants and cell volume with increased Se concentration. On the other hand, the temperature-dependent XRD studies suggest unusual lattice change around the metal-insulator (MI) transition temperature of the respective compositions. This remarkable observation suggests that the anomalous lattice effect originates the MI transition in these systems. Additionally, our density of states (DOS) calculations on FeSe$_{1.14}$ qualitatively explain the MI transition, as the low-temperature (50 K) structure DOS suggests a metallic nature and the high-temperature (300 K) structure DOS shows a gap near the Fermi level.

arXiv:2501.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study thermodynamical properties of the disorder-induced transition between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ superconducting gap functions, we calculate the grand thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ in the normal and the superconducting states. Expression for the difference between the two, $\Delta\Omega$, is derived for a two-band model for Fe-based systems with nonmagnetic impurities. The disorder is considered in a $\mathcal{T}$-matrix approximation within the multiband Eliashberg theory. In the vicinity of the Born limit near the $s_{\pm}$-to-$s_{++}$ transition, we find two solutions obtained for opposite directions of the system's evolution with respect to the impurity scattering rate. By calculating the change in entropy $\Delta S$ and the change in electronic specific heat $\Delta C$ from $\Delta\Omega$, we show that such a hysteresis is not due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking state, but it rather points out to the first order phase transition induced by the nonmagnetic disorder. Based on the $\Delta\Omega$ calculations, phase diagram is plotted representing the energetically favourable $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states and the transition between them. At finite temperature, a first order phase transition line there is limited by a critical end point. Above that point, the sharp $s_{\pm} \to s_{++}$ transition transforms to a crossover between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states.

Abstract: Seeking to unravel the enigmatic Verwey transition and its interplay with magnetism, we have conducted comprehensive measurements on the temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and magnetic moment of stoichiometric and doped-magnetite single crystals at temperatures reaching 1000 K. These investigations have allowed us to identify the Curie temperature, $T_C$, and other characteristic temperatures of the electrical resistivity. Remarkably, we have identified correlations between these temperatures and the Verwey temperature, $T_V$, indicating that the electrical transport properties and the mechanism of the Verwey transition are closely related to the magnetic properties.

# Coupling of plasmons to the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnets

Abstract: The coupling of magnons and plasmons offers a promising avenue for hybrid quantum systems, facilitating coherent energy and information transfer between magnetic and charge excitations. However, existing mechanisms often depend on weak spin-orbit coupling or temperature-activated processes, limiting their robustness for low-temperature quantum technologies. Here, we propose a novel coupling mechanism between plasmons and the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnetic insulators, which operates at zero temperature and does not require spin-orbit coupling. Using a model system consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas on an insulating antiferromagnetic substrate, we show that the electric field of the plasmons interacts with the magnetically mediated electric polarization in the antiferromagnet, arising from bonds with broken inversion symmetry. This interaction enables strong coupling to the spin-conserving two-magnon continuum, allowing for efficient hybridization.

Abstract: In this article we consider the magnetic field phase diagram of hole-doped high-$T_c$ cuprates, which has been given much less attention than the temperature diagram. In the framework of the {\it pairon model}, we show that the two characteristic energies, the pair binding energy (the gap $\Delta_p$) and the condensation energy ($\beta_c$) resulting from pair correlations, give rise to two major magnetic fields, the upper critical field $B_{c2}$ and a second field, $B_{pg}$, associated with the pseudogap (PG). The latter implies a second length scale in addition to the coherence length, characteristic of incoherent pairs. Universal scaling laws for both $B_{c2}$ and $B_{pg}$ are derived: $B_{c2}$ scales with the critical temperature, $B_{c2}/T_c\simeq 1.65$ T/K, in agreement with many experiments, and $B_{pg}$ has a similar scaling with respect to $T^*$. Finally, Fermi arcs centered on the nodal directions are predicted to appear as a function of magnetic field, an effect testable experimentally.

Abstract: We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a Chern insulator in the integer quantum Hall (QH) regime. Our results show that the effective interaction at this boundary gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons at the SC/QH interface. These fields couple to a gauge field that includes both Chern-Simons term, originating from the QH sector, and Maxwell term. Using this framework, we investigate the effects of magnetic flux vortices on the SC/QH interface. The emergence of the Chern-Simons term significantly modifies the magnetic penetration depth, influencing the Abrikosov lattice period and potentially altering the superconducting behavior at the interface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vortex solutions at the interface carry a fractional charge of $e/2$, which reflects the ratio between the effective Chern-Simons level parameter and the charge of the Cooper pairs.

Abstract: We investigate epitaxial $\text{Co}(20 \, \text{\r{A}})$ and $\text{Co}_{1-x}\text{Au}_{x}(20 \, \text{\r{A}})$ alloy thin-films surrounded by asymmetric heavy metals layers of $\text{Re}(10 \, \text{\r{A}})$ as a buffer and $\text{Pt}(30 \, \text{\r{A}})$ as a cap to study the magnetic anisotropy, interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) and damping. The increase of Au from 0% to 25% in the $\text{Co}_{1-x}\text{Au}_{x}$ alloy generates the spin-reorientation transition of around 13% of Au. The increase in Au concentration provides a significant decrease in saturation magnetization from 1690 kA/m to 982 kA/m measured for Co and $\text{Co}_{75}\text{Au}_{25}$, respectively. The effective anisotropy constant $\text{K}_{eff}$ is elevated up to 0.33 $\text{MJ/m}^{3}$ by changing the Au content. Further, our investigations of the magnetization dynamics have confirmed that the overall effective damping constant rises with the Au concentration which can be attributed to the spin pumping effect. The spin pumping leads to the highest value of effective spin mixing conductance $g^{(\uparrow \downarrow)} \approx 2.91 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2}$ in the $\text{Co}_{90}\text{Au}_{10}(20 \, \text{\r{A}})$ system, while the lowest value of $g^{(\uparrow \downarrow)} \approx 2.25 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2}$ is found for the $\text{Co}(20 \, \text{\r{A}})$ system. Additionally, we have investigated the iDMI strength, and the amplitude of iDMI decreases with increasing Au concentration. The highest surface iDMI constant value equal to 2.62 pJ/m is observed for Co.

Abstract: Octahedral antiferromagnets are distinguished by crystal lattices composed of octahedra of magnetic ions. In the fully frustrated case, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can be represented as a sum of squares of total spins for each octahedral block. We study the fully frustrated spin model for a lattice of edge-shared octahedra, which corresponds to the J1-J2 fcc antiferromagnet with J2/J1 = 1/2. The magnetization process at this strongly frustrated point features a remarkably rich sequence of different magnetic phases that include fractional plateaus at m = 1/3 and 2/3 values of the total magnetization. By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations we construct the H-T phase diagram of the classical model with eight field-induced states, which acquire stability via the order by disorder mechanism. These antiferromagnetic states have distinct spin configurations of their octahedral blocks. The same spin configurations are also relevant for the fully frustrated corner-shared model bringing an apparent similarity to their field-induced states.

Abstract: This paper reports an innovative process to fabricate $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ microtubes and nanomembranes based on ion implantation in (100)-oriented single-crystals. We show that, under specific flux and fluence conditions, the irradiation-induced strain profile promotes the detachment and rolling-up of a thin surface layer, forming a microtube. The strain-disorder interplay was investigated in detail for Cr-implanted $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ with a range of complementary methods, showing an excellent agreement between experimental and simulation data, and suggesting an exfoliation mechanism that is correlated with the anisotropic nature of the $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ monoclinic system and its easy-cleavage planes. Moreover, these microtubes can be unrolled upon a subsequent annealing step, resulting in nanomembranes with bulk-like crystalline quality that can be transferred to other substrates. The recovery of the implantation-induced damage under thermal annealing has also been studied, showing a remarkable recovery at moderate temperatures (~500 {\deg}C). This observation underscores the potential of this method for the scalable production of nanomembranes with improved reproducibility compared to conventional mechanical exfoliation techniques. Importantly, such exfoliation can be done employing different ions, providing simultaneous $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ doping, chosen to control the structural, optical, magnetic and electrical properties of the nanomembranes, thus tailoring them to fit the desired applications.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence and properties of long-distance genuine multipartite entanglement, induced via three localized magnetic defects, in a one-dimensional transverse-field XX spin-$1/2$ chain. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we determine the conditions for the existence of bound states localized at the defects. We find that the reduced density matrix (RDM) of the defects exhibits long-distance genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) across the whole range of the Hamiltonian parameter space, including regions where the two-qubit concurrence is zero. We quantify the entanglement by using numerical lower bounds for the GME concurrence, as well as by analytically deriving the GME concurrence in regions where the RDM is of rank two. Our work provides insights into generating multipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems via local control techniques.

Abstract: We deal with a type I superconductor in a constant external magnetic field. We obtain the BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation with external magnetic field and apply the implicit function theorem to it. We show that there is a unique magnetic field (the critical magnetic field) given by a smooth function of the temperature and that there is also a unique nonnegative solution (the gap function) given by a smooth function of both the temperature and the external magnetic field. Using the grand potential, we show that the transition from the normal state to the superconducting state in a type I superconductor is of the first order. Moreover we obtain the explicit expression for the entropy gap.

Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a handful of other seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in optical media.

Abstract: We microscopically construct an abelian mutual Chern-Simons lattice gauge theory for magnetic field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev model and obtain a complete characterization of the phases, including their quasiparticles. At low fields for both ferro and antiferromagnetic (FM(AFM)) Kitaev interactions, we demonstrate nonabelian Ising topological order (ITO), and explicitly construct the Majorana anyon as an intrinsic excitation -- a twist defect in our \textit{abelian} gauge theory. For the AFM case, an abelian chiral phase appears at intermediate fields with trivial topological order and fermionic bulk excitations. Remarkably, both the ITO phase and the intermediate phase have the same chiral central charge $c=1/2,$ implying no change in the quantized thermal Hall response across the transition. For the FM case, there is a direct transition from ITO to a partially polarized nontopological phase. Our study completes the proof of Kitaev's original proposal of the low-field ITO with $c=1/2$ going beyond his mean-field arguments by including the crucial effect of the gauge fluctuations, and provides a resolution of the debate surrounding the intermediate field phase in the AFM case.

Abstract: Skyrmions, which are topologically stable magnetic structures, have manifested promising features to be used as an information carrier in new-age, non-volatile data storage devices. In this article, Co/Pt square nano-structure with Co-free layer thickness in the range of 1 nm to 5 nm is taken to study the controlled creation of skyrmions. The magnetization dynamics controlled by the current-induced spin transfer torque help to nucleate skyrmions by transforming the perpendicularly magnetized ground state. This process leads to a stable state of isolated skyrmions via a complex transformation of the Neel wall following its image inversion. Skyrmion numbers vary with increasing thickness as the current density gradually increases. The impact of higher-order anisotropy constants (up to the second order) on the relaxed state of a system, compared to first-order anisotropy alone, has been examined. Additionally, the effect of temperature on the formation of skyrmions has been analyzed for all thicknesses.

Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.

Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.

Abstract: We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z<1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.

Abstract: Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heat maps show a structural transition at 50 K, which could possibly be the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.

Abstract: Based on a microscopic model of nonequilibrium carrier generation in a leaky dielectric, we analytically derive hysteresis loops for the dielectric response of non-polar, non-ferroelectric materials. We demonstrate how complex dielectric responses can emerge solely from the influence of transport processes that depend on energy levels, voltage polarity, and asymmetries in charge transfer rates. By combining Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and voltammetry, we address critical questions related to the microscopic mechanisms in poorly conductive systems dominated by displacement currents. The impedance analysis, extended to higher-order harmonics, provides deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of dielectric materials, emphasizing the need to correlate impedance spectroscopy with dielectric spectroscopy for a thorough understanding of dipole relaxation and transport phenomena. Our approach provides a fully analytical framework that directly correlates microscopic charge dynamics with macroscopic dielectric responses, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive capability for systems dominated by displacement currents.

Abstract: We propose an entropy-related function (non-repeatability) that describes dynamical behaviors in complex systems. A normalized version of this function (mutability) has been previously used in statistical physics. To illustrate their characteristics, we apply these functions to different systems: (a) magnetic moments on a square lattice and (b) real seismic data extracted from the IPOC-2007-2014 catalog. These systems are well-established in the literature, making them suitable benchmarks for testing the new approach. Shannon entropy is used as a reference to facilitate comparison, enabling us to highlight similarities, differences, and the potential benefits of the new measure. Notably, non-repeatability and mutability are sensitive to the order in which the data sequence is collected, distinguishing them from traditional entropy measures.

Abstract: We propose a novel ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism effect, the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is coupled to the switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. We demonstrate the design principles for the ferroelectric altermagnets and the additional symmetry constraints necessary for switching the altermagnetic spin splitting through flipping the electric polarization based on the state-of-the-art spin-group symmetry techniques. 22 ferroelectric altermagnets are found by screening through the 2001 experimental reported magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database and 2 of them are identified as ferroelectric switchable altermagnets. Using the hybrid improper ferroelectric material [C(NH2)3]Cr(HCOO)3 as an example, we show how the altermagnetic spin splitting is tightly coupled to the ferroelectric polarization, providing an ideal platform for designing electric-field-controllable multiferroic devices. Finally, we find that such manipulation of altermagnetism can be detected by monitoring the physical quantities that are related to the non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole, such as the linearly polarized photogalvanic spin current.

Abstract: Interfaces play a substantial role for the functional properties of structured magnetic materials and magnetic multilayers. Modeling the functional behavior of magnetic materials requires the treatment of the relevant phenomena at the device level. Properties predicted from the electronic structure and spin dynamics at the atomistic level have to be properly transferred into a continuum level treatment. In this work we show how Co/Ru/Co three layers can be simulated with the continuum theory of micromagnetism, with interface coupling energies and bulk intrinsic properties properly derived from the results of \emph{ab initio} and spin dynamics simulations at different temperatures.

Abstract: Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.

In the nuclear fusion literature, such coils have been proposed to partially produce the 3D magnetic fields for stellarators and provide passive stabilization. We perform the first optimizations of PSC arrays with respect to the orientation, shape, and location of each coil, jointly minimized with the background fields. We conclude by generating passive coil array solutions for four stellarators.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that interprets the electromagnetic field as a manifestation of spacetime pseudo-curvature, bridging electromagnetism with the geometric principles of general relativity. By introducing modified field equations, we recover classical electromagnetic results, including Coulomb's Law, the magnetic field of a rotating sphere, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Additionally, this framework predicts unique phenomena, such as test-charge-dependent time dilation and length contraction, which lie outside the scope of Maxwell's electromagnetism and Quantum Electrodynamics. These results suggest new avenues for exploring the interplay between geometry and field theories in fundamental physics.

Abstract: In recent years, plasmonic nanocavities have emerged as powerful tools for controlling and enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. This study explores the role of plasmonic nanocavities in manipulating nonadiabatic dynamics, particularly in systems where fast electronic transitions are crucial. By coupling molecular states to the plasmonic resonances of metallic nanocavities, we demonstrate that the local electromagnetic fields generated by plasmons can significantly influence the rates and pathways of nonadiabatic transitions, including electron transfer and excitation relaxation processes. Using the Floquet quantum master equation (FQME) and Floquet surface hopping (FSH) methods that we previously developed, we find that plasmonic nanocavities can enhance nonadiabatic effects by tuning the plasmonic coupling strength, the molecule-metal interaction strength, and the material properties. These approaches offer a new perspective for predicting molecular dynamics in ultrafast processes. Our findings pave the way for designing novel plasmonic devices capable of controlling electron and energy transfer in chemical reactions, optoelectronic applications, and quantum information processing.

Abstract: High-energy, high-flux collimated proton beams with high repetition rates are critical for applications such as proton therapy, proton radiography, high-energy-density matter generation, and compact particle accelerators. However, achieving proton beam collimation has typically relied on complex and expensive target fabrication or precise control of auxiliary laser pulses, which poses significant limitations for high-repetition applications. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical method for collimated proton acceleration using a single femtosecond Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) laser with an intensity exceeding 1020 W/cm2 irradiating a simple planar target. Compared to conventional Gaussian laser-driven schemes, the maximum proton energy is enhanced by 60% (reaching 35 MeV) and beam divergence is much reduced. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that a plasma jet is initially focused by the hollow electric sheath field of the LG laser, and then electrons in the jet are further collimated by self-generated magnetic fields. This process amplifies the charge-separation electric field between electrons and ions, leading to increased proton energy in the longitudinal direction and improved collimation in the transverse direction. This single-LG-laser-driven collimation mechanism offers a promising pathway for high-repetition, high-quality proton beam generation, with broad potential applications including proton therapy and fast ignition in inertial confinement fusion.

Abstract: This work investigates the effects of time-varying media, where optical properties change over time, on electromagnetic wave propagation, focusing on plane waves and free-electron evanescent waves. We introduce a switching parameter, $\tau$, to model ultrafast switching in the femtosecond to nanosecond range. For plane-wave incidence at angular frequency $\omega_0$, we derive a generalized expression for the backward-to-forward flux ratio as a function of $\omega_0$ and $\tau$, aligning with recent experimental data and providing a unified interpretation framework. For free-electron incidence, we observe intensity saturation in temporal transition radiation at $I_{\textrm{max}}$ for $\tau \leq \tau_{\textrm{0}}$, with both $I_{\textrm{max}}$ and $\tau_{\textrm{0}}$ depending on electron speed. These results highlight the importance of precise $\tau$ control in experiments to probe time-varying media effectively.

# Observation of Strong Nonreciprocal Thermal Emission

Abstract: The Kirchhoff`s law of thermal radiation stating the equivalence of emissivity and absorptivity at the same wavelength, angle, and polarization, has completely constrained emission and absorption processes. Achieving strong nonreciprocal emission points to fundamental advances for applications such as energy harvesting, heat transfer, and sensing, but strong nonreciprocal thermal emission has not been experimentally realized. Here, we observe strong nonreciprocal thermal emission using a custom-designed angle-resolved magnetic thermal emission spectroscopy and an epitaxially-transferred gradient-doped metamaterial. We show that under magnetic field, the metamaterial strongly breaks the Kirchhoff`s law, with a difference between emissivity and absorptivity at the same wavelength and angle reaching as high as 0.43. Significant nonreciprocal emission persists over broad spectral and angular ranges. The demonstration of strong nonreciprocal thermal emission and the approach can be useful for systematic exploration of nonreciprocal thermal photonics for thermal management, infrared camouflage, and energy conversion.

Abstract: Partially coherent electromagnetic sources with cylindrical symmetry and infinite extent radiating outwards are introduced. Their $3\times3$ cross-spectral density matrix is given through expansions of the field components in terms of basis functions related to the Hankel functions. The spectral density and the three-dimensional degree of polarization of such sources and the fields they radiate are examined. Several examples are presented and discussed. Among them, a class of cylindrical sources whose coherent vector modes coincide with the above basis functions is defined and studied.

# Is there a conflict between causality and diamagnetism?

Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a handful of other seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in optical media.

# Selective Actuation Enabled Multifunctional Magneto-mechanical Metamaterial for Programming Elastic Wave Propagation

Abstract: Active metamaterials are a type of metamaterial with tunable properties enabled by structural reconfigurations. Existing active metamaterials often achieve only a limited number of structural reconfigurations upon the application of an external load across the entire structure. Here, we propose a selective actuation strategy for inhomogeneous deformations of magneto-mechanical metamaterials, which allows for the integration of multiple elastic wave tuning functionalities into a single metamaterial design. Central to this actuation strategy is that a magnetic field is applied to specific unit cells instead of the entire metamaterial, and the unit cell can transform between two geometrically distinct shapes, which exhibit very different mechanical responses to elastic wave excitations. Our numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate that the tunable response of the unit cell, coupled with inhomogeneous deformation achieved through selective actuation, unlocks multifunctional capabilities of magneto-mechanical metamaterials such as tunable elastic wave transmittance, elastic waveguide, and vibration isolation. The proposed selective actuation strategy offers a simple but effective way to control the tunable properties and thus enhances the programmability of magneto-mechanical metamaterials, which also expands the application space of magneto-mechanical metamaterials in elastic wave manipulation.

Abstract: Single-mode fibers are used in fiber-optic gyroscopes to measure the Sagnac effect and are planned to be used in forthcoming experiments on the gravitationally induced phase shift in single photons. However, current theoretical models of such experiments are limited to ray-optics approximations or, if based on wave optics, to a restricted class of fiber alignments. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper develops a comprehensive perturbative scheme to solve for electromagnetic modes, i.e., monochromatic solutions to Maxwell's equations, of arbitrarily bent step-index fibers in general stationary space-times. This leads to transport equations for the electromagnetic phase and polarization that include the gravitational redshift, the Sagnac effect, a generalization of Rytov's law to curved space, a gravitational Faraday effect in the form of shift-induced gyrotropy, as well as inverse spin Hall effects caused by fiber bending, gravitational acceleration, and space-time curvature.

Abstract: In recent decades, significant progress has been made in construction and study of individual quantum systems consisting of the basic single matter and energy particles, i.e., atoms and photons, which show great potentials in quantum computation and communication. Here, we demonstrate that the quadruply-bonded Mo$_2$ unit of the complex can trap photons of visible light under ambient conditions, producing intense local electromagnetic (EM) field that features squeezed states, photon antibunching, and vacuum Rabi splitting. Our results show that both the electronic and vibrational states of the Mo$_2$ molecule are modified by coherent coupling with the scattered photons of the Mo$_2$ unit, as evidenced by the Rabi doublet4 and the Mollow triplet in the incoherent resonance fluorescence and the Raman spectra. The Mo$_2$ molecule, acting as an independent emitter-resonator integrated quantum system, allows optical experiments to be conducted in free space, enabling fundamental quantum phenomena to be observed through conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This provides a new platform for study of field effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the optical domain. The insights gained from this study advance our understanding in metal-metal bond chemistry, molecular physics and quantum optics, with applications in quantum information processing, optoelectronic devices and control of chemical reactivity.

Abstract: The precise control of nuclear spin states is crucial for a wide range of quantum technology applications. Here, we propose a fast and robust single qubit gate in $^{87}$Sr, utilizing the concept of optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER). ONER exploits the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient generated by its electronic environment, enabling spin level transitions via amplitude-modulated laser light. We investigate the hyperfine structure of the 5s$^2$ $^1S_{0}\rightarrow{}$ 5s5p $^3P_1$ optical transition in neutral $^{87}$Sr, and identify the magnetic field strengths and laser parameters necessary to drive spin transitions between the $m_I$ = -9/2 and $m_I$ = -5/2 hyperfine levels in the ground state. Our simulations show that ONER could enable faster spin operations compared to the state-of-the-art oscillations in this 'atomic qubit'. Moreover, we show that the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing can be surpassed even in the presence of typical noise sources. These results pave the way for significant advances in nuclear spin control, opening new possibilities for quantum memories and other quantum technologies.

# Circularly Polarized Luminescence Control through Molecular Rotation in Crystalline Chiral Binuclear N-Heterocyclic Carbene Au(I) Complexes

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-s9mms?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Hajime, Ito

The rotational motion within molecular crystals can affect not only their internal structure and symmetry, but also often results in the alteration of bulk properties such as thermal expansion, macroscopic motion, change in electromagnetic, optical, and photophysical properties. In this work, we demonstrate how the thermally activated molecular rotation within the crystals of chiral binuclear N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I) complexes can modulate their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The enantiomeric pair of chiral binuclear NHC Au(I) complexes, 1-R and 1-S, exhibit a distinct C2-symmetric conformation, derived from non-equivalent orientations of phenyl moieties at the chiral NHC ligands. The variable-temperature solid-state 2H NMR studies revealed that these non-equivalent phenyl moieties undergo fast rotational motion above 273K, potentially promoting symmetrization of molecular structures in the crystal. The latter, in combination with the inherent chirality of 1-R and 1-S complexes, results in the emergence of the temperature-dependent CPL behavior in the crystalline state with a noticeable increase of luminescence intensity and dissymmetry factors upon cooling from 333K to 213K (|ΔICPL|: + ~300%; |glum|: + ~50%). Such thermo-responsive behavior can be attributed not only to thermal rotation-induced luminescence quenching but also to the potential effect of phenyls rotation on the symmetry of the complexes.

# Hysteresis and Thermomagnetic Characteristics of Soils and Rocks in Eastern Botswana

## 博茨瓦纳东部土壤和岩石的磁滞和热磁特征

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5608272/latest

Soil magnetic properties are important for many applications including palaeomagnetism and (plate) tectonics, geological interpretation, geoexploration, mining, forensics, geotechnical engineering, and industry. The results of this work are a continuation of previous work on magnetic susceptibilities of soils in eastern Botswana. The magnetic properties measured include Curie temperature (Tc) determined in nitrogen gas atmosphere and hysteresis parameters (Hc, Hcr, Mr, Ms). Thermomagnetic curves were measured from room temperature up to 700 oC, enabling determination of Curie temperature which has supported the classification of the magnetic granulometry and mineralogy.
The thermomagnetic curves revealed the existence of magnetic minerals such as hematite, magnetite and pyrrhotite, and their Curie temperatures were found to be 600 &deg;C, 580 &deg;C, and 200 &deg;C, respectively. The presence of magnetic materials is also revealed by the hysteresis loops of some soil samples. The hysteresis and thermomagnetic curves both indicate that the main contribution comes from magnetite-like phases. Thermomagnetic curves of soil samples collected along the Ramatlabama to Ramokgwebana, which traverses through the Kaapvaal Craton, Limpopo belt and Zimbabwe Craton could be used to differentiate the boundaries of the cratons and the orogenic belt. Airborne magnetic data covering the study area are being interpreted with particular reference to some of the measured magnetic properties and determined soil characteristics thereby increasing confidence in the geological interpretation.
