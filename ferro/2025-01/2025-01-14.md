Author(s): Zhenyong Xue, Ping Yu, Yuhang Zhang, Zhuwei Zhang, Hao Sun, Zhiqi Hou, Haiyan Hong, Shimin Le, and Hu Chen<br /><p>The cold shock domain protein, BcCsp, a key regulator of gene expression, binds strongly to single-stranded DNA that contains a particular sequence. Magnetic tweezer studies reveal that such DNA stabilizes both the native folded and partially unfolded states of BcCsp, reducing its unfolding rate while leaving folding unaffected. This work also uncovers how ssDNA binding reshapes the protein’s energy landscape, coupling folding dynamics with ligand interactions.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRE/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.014413.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

# Tuning Quantum States at Chirality-Reversed Planar Interface in Weyl Semimetals using an Interstitial Layer

arXiv:2501.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic band structure of Weyl semimetals possesses pairs of linear band crossings, called Weyl nodes, characterized by opposite chirality charges associated with each node. The momentum space position of the nodes can reverse across a planar interface and these host Fermi-arc-like bound states, in addition to scattering states. We show that a magnetic interstitial layer can tune these states in three distinct ways. The electrostatic potential and one of the in-plane magnetic potential components control the shape of the bound state Fermi-arcs. For moderate values of the same in-plane magnetic potential electrons are spin-filtered across the interface, while both the in-plane magnetic components and the electrostatic potential control the transmission of electrons. The ratio of in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic components can be used to turn on or turn off the magnetic potential effects, since the latter does not affect the interface states. The tunability arises from spin-momentum locking and chirality reversal at the interface. Thus, the effects can mix or interchange depending on the specific material but the states will remain tunable.

**Authors:** Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Hae-Young Kee

arXiv:2501.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.

## 具有相关无序的伊辛自旋玻璃中随机场下铁磁相的不稳定性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05658

**Authors:** Hidetoshi Nishimori

arXiv:2501.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that the ferromagnetic phase remains stable under random magnetic fields in three and higher dimensions for the ferromagnetic Ising model and the Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses without correlation in the disorder variables. We investigate an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder and demonstrate that the ferromagnetic phase on the Nishimori line becomes unstable under random fields in any dimension, provided that magnetic field chaos exists in the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice. This result underscores the profound impact of spatial correlations in the disorder. Additionally, we show that this instability can also be attributed to disorder (bond) chaos. Furthermore, we argue that the model with correlated disorder remains in the ferromagnetic phase even in the presence of symmetry-breaking fields, as long as the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice exhibits a spin glass phase under a magnetic field. These findings reveal fundamentally different properties of the ferromagnetic phase in models with correlation in disorder compared to those without.

# Towards optimization of the Josephson diode effect

## 约瑟夫森二极管效应的优化

**Authors:** Michiyasu Mori, Wataru Koshibae, Sadamichi Maekawa

arXiv:2501.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the applied current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is analytically calculated using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. It is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device

arXiv:2501.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the anomalous Hall effect of topologically-nontrivial MXenes, $M_2M'$C$_2$O$_2$, and the electronic structure in the presence of magnetic proximity effect is theoretically investigated. The theoretical analysis is performed in two different ways: an effective model and a multi-orbital tight-binding model generated from the first-principles band structure. These two theoretical methods provided the similar profile of Berry curvature for electronic states near the bulk band gap, and they show an unconventional rise of hollowed-out peak in the profile with the tilt of proximity magnetic potential. The anomalous Hall conductivity is also calculated as a function of the charge density and the tilt angle of proximity magnetic order. Then, an unconventional enhancement of anomalous Hall conductivity by the tilt of magnetic order is theoretically predicted as a result of the variation of Berry curvature.

arXiv:2501.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of magnon-phonon-photon interactions in cubic ferromagnets near orientational phase transitions (OPT). The study focuses on the interplay of magnetoelastic (ME), electromagnetic-spin (EMS), and acousticelectromagnetic (AEM) interactions in ferromagnetic dielectrics and metals. By deriving dispersion equations for coupled waves, the research reveals how the dynamic properties of magnetically ordered crystals evolve in response to these interactions under varying external magnetic fields and near OPT points. The ME interaction prominently influences spin and elastic wave dynamics, giving rise to coupled modes such as quasimagnon and quasi-acoustic waves. Near the OPT, these interactions become dominant, leading to phenomena like the magnetoelastic gap and softening of vibrational modes. The EMS interaction significantly alters the activation energy and dispersion of quasi-spin and quasi-electromagnetic waves. In ferromagnetic metals, helicons (weakly damped electromagnetic waves) exhibit strong coupling with spin and elastic waves, particularly in the OPT region. The study identifies conditions for triple resonance among spin, elastic, and electromagnetic waves. Additionally, it explores the frequency-dependent rotation of polarization planes in electromagnetic and magnetoelastic waves, which sharpens near OPT points. These results provide a deeper understanding of the coupled dynamics in ferromagnetic materials, paving the way for new technological applications in spintronics, signal processing, and advanced magneto-optical devices. The theoretical framework developed here emphasizes the critical role of ME, EMS, and AEM interactions in tailoring wave properties for specific applications, particularly in designing next-generation magnetic and electronic systems.

# Bogolon mediated light absorption in multi-component BEC with $Z_2$ symmetry

## 具有 $ Z_2 $ 对称性的多组分BEC中Bogolon介导的光吸收

**Authors:** Xinyu Zhu, Meng Sun

arXiv:2501.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the light absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the light absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory of electromagnetic power absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.

Abstract: Long-range magnetic ordering of the orbital motion of oxygen atoms within NO$_3$$^-$ cations is identified from experimental measurements of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$($T$) in LiNO$_3$, Ca(NO$_3$)$_2$, K$_{0.5}$Rb$_{0.5}$NO$_3$ and C(NH$_2$)$_3$NO$_3$ at their respective order-disorder, solid-solid phase transitions $T$$_N$. The observed sharp changes in $\chi$($T$) and accompanying hysteretic behavior indicate the phase transitions to be first order. A model employing the law of conservation of angular momentum is used to explain why the librations between neighboring NO$_3$$^-$ become geared below $T$$_N$. Since the periodic motions involve concerted motion of net charges, the associated magnetic moments of the NO$_3$$^-$ ions indirectly establish an antiferromagnetic structure below $T$$_N$. Our findings identify a previously unidentified type of molecular interaction which may be exploited to further increase the enthalpy of the widely-popular hydrated salts employed as energy storage devices.

Abstract: Time crystals represent a non-equilibrium state of matter with broken time-translation symmetry that repeats itself at regular time intervals. Though initially envisioned as a self-generated and self-sustained periodic motion, their realization has usually required the utilization of external periodic inputs or modulations. While at first it looked like, for a time crystal to exist, the initial proposal had to be abandoned, the recent evidence of inherent time crystals is bringing back the idea of self-generated time crystal under the spotlight. In this work, we demonstrate the appearance of a self-generated space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson junctions with the ferromagnet interface without any external influence. The presence of the exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a ferromagnet with broken structural inversion symmetry modifies the current phase relation and the critical current due to the coupling between the magnetic moment and Josephson phase. This breaks the time translation symmetry leading to the appearance of the time-crystalline order in the spatiotemporal dependence of superconducting current, which evolves with the double of the modulation frequency. Due to its unique origin and properties, this inherent time crystalline order stands out from the commonly known classification of time crystals into discrete and continuous ones. A self-generated time crystal is demonstrated in two types of hybrid Josephson junctions: the superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor on a topological insulator and the superconductor-three layer ferromagnet-superconductor. Further, we also show that a recently developed magnetometry device that visualizes a supercurrent flow in the Josephson junction at the nanoscale can be used as a platform for experimental detection of space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson junctions.

Abstract: Single-layer transition-metal dichalcogenides provide an unique intrinsic entanglement between the spin/valley/orbital degrees of freedom and the polarization of scattered photons. This scenario gives rise to the well-assessed optical dichroism observed by using both steady and time-resolved probes. In this paper we provide a compact analytical modelling of the onset of a finite Faraday/Kerr optical rotation upon shining with a circularly polarized light. We identify different optical features displaying optical rotation at different characteristic energies, and we describe in an analytical framework the time-dependence of their intensities as a consequence of the main spin-conserving and spin-flip processes.

Abstract: Magneto-optical techniques have become essential tools in spintronics, enabling the investigation of spin dynamics in the ultrafast regime. A key challenge in this field has been to accurately isolate the contributions to magneto-optical signals of spin transport phenomena from the local magnetization dynamics. The contribution of transported and accumulated spins was long believed to be orders of magnitude smaller than that of the magnetization and thus previous approaches to disentangle these signals have relied on specific experimental designs, usually including thick metal layers. Here, we present experimental evidence demonstrating that the magneto-optical signal from ultrafast spin accumulations can, under certain conditions, be comparable to or even exceed that of the magnetic layer in a standard ultrafast demagnetization experiment. Our findings provide a new framework for accessing and isolating these spin accumulations, allowing for time and depth dependent probing of transported spin and/or orbital angular momentum.

Abstract: The thermoelectric Thomson effect, predicted in the 1850s by William Thomson, produces volumetric heating/cooling in a conductor due to the concerted action of the Seebeck and Peltier effects. Recently, transverse thermoelectrics studies on the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects have progressed rapidly to enable versatile thermal management technologies and to explore topological transport properties. However, a transverse Thomson effect, arising from the concerted action of the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects, has not yet been observed. Here, we report the observation of the transverse Thomson effect in a conductor. We observed volumetric heating/cooling in a semimetallic Bi$_{88}$Sb$_{12}$ alloy induced by a charge current, temperature gradient, and magnetic field applied orthogonally to each other using thermoelectric imaging techniques. We found that the heating/cooling can be switched by the field direction. Our experiments and analyses reveal the essential difference between the conventional and transverse Thomson effects; the former depends sorely on the temperature derivative of the Seebeck coefficient, while the latter depends not only on the temperature derivative of the Nernst coefficient but also on its magnitude. The observation of the transverse Thomson effect fills a missing piece in the history of thermoelectrics and provides a new principle for active thermal management technologies.

Abstract: Recent advancements in exchange-correlation functionals within density functional theory highlight the need for rigorous validation across diverse types of materials properties. In this study, we assess the performance of the newly developed meta-GGA r$^2$SCAN and its predecessor, SCAN, in predicting the N\'eel transition temperature of antiferromagnetic materials. Our analysis includes 48 magnetic materials, spanning both simple and complex systems. Using DFT, we compute the energies of various magnetic configurations and extract exchange interaction parameters through a least-squares fitting approach. These parameters are then used in classical Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the transition temperatures. Our results demonstrate that both SCAN and r$^2$SCAN greatly outperform standard GGA and GGA+$U$ methods, yielding predictions that closely align with experimental values. The Pearson correlation coefficients for SCAN and r$^2$SCAN are 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, when compared to experimental transition temperatures. Additionally, we calculate the energy differences between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic configurations to assess the performance of the hybrid HSE06 functional. We found that the HSE06 functional underestimates transition temperatures compared to the meta-GGA functionals and experimental values.

arXiv:2501.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kekul\'e-Kitaev model, an extension of the Kitaev model, exhibits quantum spin liquid (QSL) properties, which has an exact solution through Kitaev parton construction. In this study, we calculate the dynamical spin structure factor as a linear response and the third-order magnetic susceptibility as a nonlinear response using two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy for Kekul\'e-Kitaev model. Our results reveal that the few-matter fermion excitations approximation provides reliable results for both linear and nonlinear responses. Notably, while the Kekul\'e-Kitaev model shows linear and nonlinear responses qualitatively similar to the Kitaev model, it displays distinct behavior under a weak uniform/staggered magnetic field. Specifically, the Kekul\'e-Kitaev model does not present a non-Abelian phase under a uniform magnetic field, while such phase appears in the presence of a staggered magnetic field. Interestingly, within the non-Abelian phase, signals originating from two non-adjacent fluxes in the nonlinear response are stronger than signals from other flux excitations. Furthermore, We demonstrate that the ground state of the Kekul\'e-Kitaev model at isotropic coupling is mapped, through unitary spin rotations, to an excited state of the Kitaev model with a uniform flux configuration.

Abstract: Here we investigate epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 ferroelectric thin films as potential candidates to be used as non-volatile electric-field-modulated thermal memories. The electric-field dependence of the thermal conductivity of metal/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/YSZ devices is found to be hysteretic, resembling the polarization vs electric field hysteresis loops, being maximum (minimum) at large applied positive (negative) voltages from the top metallic electrode. This dynamic thermal response is compatible with the coupling between the ferroelectric polarization and the oxygen ion migration, in which the oxygen vacancies are the main phonon scattering sources and the polarization acts as an electrically active ion migration barrier that creates the hysteresis. This new mechanism enables two non-volatile thermal states: high (ON) and low (OFF) thermal conductivity, with an ON/OFF ratio of 1.6. Both the ON and OFF states exhibit high stability over time, though the switching speed is limited by ion mobility in the YSZ electrode.

Abstract: We report the bias voltage controlled inversions of tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in magnetic tunnel junctions composed of Fe3GaTe2 electrodes and hBN tunneling barrier, observed at room temperature. The polarity reversal of TMR occurs consistently at around 0.625 V across multiple devices and temperatures, highlighting the robustness of the effect. To understand this behavior, we developed a theoretical model incorporating spin-resolved density of states (DOS) at high energy levels. By adjusting the DOS weighting at different k points to account for misalignment between the crystal structure of electrodes in experimental devices, we improved agreement between experimental and theoretical inversion voltages. Our results provide valuable insight into the voltage-controlled spin injection and detection in two-dimensional magnetic tunnel junctions, with implications for the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices.

arXiv:2501.06064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent numerical works have revealed the instability of many-body localized (MBL) phase in disordered quantum many-body systems with finite system sizes and over finite timescales. This instability arises from Griffith regions that occur at the thermodynamic limit, which rapidly thermalize and affect the surrounding typical MBL regions, introducing an avalanche mechanism into the system. Here, we consider the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-preserving interacting Ising Majorana chain model, which exhibits a more complex phase diagram, where an ergodic phase emerges between two MBL phases with different long-range order properties. We calculate the dynamic characteristics of the model when coupled to an infinite bath under perturbation, and through scaling behavior of the slowest thermalization rate, we find how critical disorder strengths in finite-size systems are affected by the avalanche mechanism. We also employe the embedded inclusion model and use the time evolution of mutual information between each spin and the artificial Griffith region to probe the diffusion of the thermal bubble. We observe that in finite-sized systems, the critical disorder strength gradually drifts away from the central. Our work demonstrate that both MBL paramagnetic phase and MBL spin-glass phase are unstable at finite sizes.

Abstract: Graphene spintronics offers a promising route to achieve low power 2D electronics for next generation classical and quantum computation. As device length scales are reduced to the limit of the electron mean free path, the transport mechanism crosses over to the ballistic regime. However, ballistic transport has yet to be shown in a graphene spintronic device, a necessary step towards realising ballistic spintronics. Here, we report ballistic injection of spin polarised carriers via one-dimensional contacts between magnetic nanowires and a high mobility graphene channel. The nanowire-graphene interface defines an effective constriction that confines charge carriers over a length scale smaller than that of their mean free path. This is evidenced by the observation of quantised conductance through the contacts with no applied magnetic field and a transition into the quantum Hall regime with increasing field strength. These effects occur in the absence of any constriction in the graphene itself and occur across several devices with transmission probability in the range T = 0.08 - 0.30.

Abstract: Quantum sensors offer exceptional sensitivity to nanoscale magnetic field fluctuations, where non-stationary effects such as spin diffusion and non-Markovian dynamics arising from coupling to few environmental degrees of freedom play critical roles. Here, we demonstrate how quantum sensors can characterize the statistical properties of noise sources, distinguishing between stationary and non-stationary behaviors, as well as Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a platform, we develop a physical noise model that analytically predicts Ramsey decay curves under different noise regimes. These predictions are experimentally validated by measuring Ramsey decay for NV centers subject to injected noise of each type. Our results showcase the capability of quantum sensors to unravel complex noise behaviors induced by nanoscale environments, shedding light on their physical origins and guiding the development of strategies to mitigate decoherence. This work deepens our understanding of noise dynamics at the nanoscale and lays the foundation for enhancing the performance and robustness of quantum technologies.

Abstract: We present an open-source simulation framework for optically detected magnetic resonance, developed in Python. The framework allows users to construct, manipulate, and evolve multipartite quantum systems that consist of spins and electronic levels. We provide an interface for efficient time-evolution in Lindblad form as well as a framework for facilitating simulation of spatial and generalized stochastic dynamics. Further, symbolic operator construction and propagation is supported for simple model systems making the framework also ideal for use in classroom instruction of magnetic resonance. Designed to be backend-agnostic, the library leverages existing Python libraries as computational backends. We introduce the most important functionality and illustrate the syntax on a series of examples. These include systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and photo-generated spin-correlated radical pairs for which our library offers system-specific sub-modules.

Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are an exciting platform for on-demand quantum, and classical optoelectronic and photonic devices. However, their potential success is limited by the extreme sensitivity and low stability arising from their weak intrinsic lattice bond energy and complex surface chemistry. Here we report a novel platform of buried perovskite quantum dots (b-PQDs) in a three-dimensional perovskite thin-film, fabricated using one-step, flash annealing, which overcomes surface related instabilities in colloidal perovskite dots. The b-PQDs demonstrate ultrabright and stable single-dot emission, with resolution-limited linewidths below 130 {\mu}eV, photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.1), no blinking, suppressed spectral diffusion, and high photon count rates of 10^4/s, consistent with unity quantum yield. The ultrasharp linewidth resolves exciton fine-structures (dark and triplet excitons) and their dynamics under a magnetic field. Additionally, b-PQDs can be electrically driven to emit single photons with 1 meV linewidth and photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.4). These results pave the way for on-chip, low-cost single-photon sources for next generation quantum optical communication and sensing.

Abstract: We study how time-dependent energy fluctuations impact the dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a noisy ramped quench of the transverse magnetic field in a quantum Ising chain. By numerically solving the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation of the mode-decoupled fermionic Hamiltonian of the problem, we identify two generic scenarios: Depending on the amplitude of the noise and the rate of the ramp, the expected periodic sequence of noiseless DQPTs may either be uniformly shifted in time or else replaced by a disarray of closely spaced DQPTs. Guided by an exact noise master equation, we trace the phenomenon to the interplay between noise-induced excitations which accumulate during the quench and the near-adiabatic dynamics of the massive modes of the system. Our analysis generalizes to any 1D fermionic two-band model subject to a noisy quench.

Abstract: We study the effect of the magnon-magnon interaction on the nonlinear magnon transport. The magnonmagnon interaction induces nonreciprocal magnon decay when the time-reversal symmetry is broken and leads to nonlinear thermal responses of magnons. We construct a theoretical framework to study the nonlinear thermal responses due to the nonreciprocal magnon decay by using the imaginary Dyson equation and quantum kinetic theory, which is then applied to models of one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnets and 2D honeycomb ferromagnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. An order estimate shows that the nonlinear thermal response from the present mechanism is feasible for experimental measurement.

Abstract: The Berry curvature dipole is well-known to cause Hall conductivity. This study expands on previous results to demonstrate how two- and three-dimensional materials react under a tilted magnetic field in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We show how the Hall effect has a quantum origin by deriving the general form of intrinsic and extrinsic currents in materials under a tilted magnetic field. Our focus is on determining the linear and nonlinear response of two-dimensional materials. We also demonstrate that as the result of the perpendicular component of the magnetic field a current resulted by both velocity and Berry curvature can occur in two-dimensional materials and topological crystalline insulators in second harmonic generation and ratchet responses. The findings of this research may provide insight into the transport characteristics of materials in the semi-classical regime and initiate a new chapter in linear and nonlinear Hall effects.

Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.

Abstract: Magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSM) have recently attracted much attention due to their potential in realizing strong anomalous Hall effects. Yet, how to design such systems remains unclear. Based on first-principles calculations, we show here that the ferromagnetic half-metallic compound In$_2$CoSe$_4$ has several pairs of Weyl points and is hence a good candidate for magnetic WSM. These Weyl points would approach the Fermi level gradually as the Hubbard $U$ increases, and finally disappear after a critical value $U_c$. The range of the Hubbard $U$ that can realize the magnetic WSM state can be expanded by pressure, manifesting the practical utility of the present prediction. Moreover, by generating two surface terminations at Co or In atom after cleaving the compound at the Co-Se bonds, the nontrivial Fermi arcs connecting one pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality are discovered in surface states. Furthermore, it is possible to observe the nontrivial surface state experimentally, e.g., angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. As such, the present findings imply strongly a new magnetic WSM which may host a large anomalous Hall conductivity.

Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.

Abstract: The rise of electron spin qubit architectures for quantum computing processors has led to a strong interest in designing and integrating ferromagnets to induce stray magnetic fields for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The integration of nanomagnets imposes however strict layout and processing constraints, challenging the arrangement of different gating layers and the control of neighboring qubit frequencies. This work reports a successful integration of nano-sized cobalt control gates into a multi-gate FD-SOI nanowire with nanometer-scale dot-to-magnet pitch, simultaneously exploiting electrical and ferromagnetic properties of the gate stack at nanoscale. The electrical characterization of the multi-gate nanowire exhibits full field effect functionality of all ferromagnetic gates from room temperature to 10 mK, proving quantum dot formation when ferromagnets are operated as barrier gates. The front-end-of-line (FEOL) compatible integration of cobalt is examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high/low frequency capacitance characterization, confirming the quality of interfaces and control over material diffusion. Insights into the magnetic properties of thin films and patterned control-gates are provided by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron holography measurements. Micromagnetic simulations anticipate that this structure fulfills the requirements for EDSR driving for magnetic fields higher than 1 T, where a homogeneous magnetization along the hard magnetic axis of the Co gates is expected. The FDSOI architecture showcased in this study provides a scalable alternative to micromagnets deposited in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) processes, while bringing technological insights for the FEOL-compatible integration of Co nanostructures in spin qubit devices.

Abstract: Twisting two-dimensional van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin-textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, we consider pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, we fabricate symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures. The magneto-transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist-angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non-volatile magnetic memory at zero-field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin-switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results highlight the combination between twist-angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin-switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest towards the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.

Abstract: The recent discovery of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline phases marks a major breakthrough in soft matter research. An intermediate phase, often observed between the nonpolar and the ferroelectric nematic phase, shows a distinct antiferroelectric response to electric fields. However, its structure and formation mechanisms remain debated, with flexoelectric and electrostatics effects proposed as competing mechanisms. By controlling the magnitude of electrostatic forces through ion addition in two representative ferroelectric nematic materials, we show that the primary mechanism for the emergence of antiferroelectric order is the flexoelectric coupling between electric polarization and splay deformation of the nematic director. The addition of ions significantly expands the temperature range over which the antiferroelectric phase is observed, with this range increasing with increasing ion concentration. Polarizing optical microscopy studies and second harmonic generation microscopy reveal the splayed structure modulated in two dimensions, while SHG interferometry confirms its antiferroelectric character. We extend the model previously used to describe pretransitional behaviour by incorporating the electrostatic contribution of ions. The model shows qualitative agreement with the experiments, accurately reproducing the phase diagram and temperature-dependent evolution of the modulation period of the observed structure.

Abstract: The Gr\"{u}neisen ratio $\Gamma$ and its magnetic analog, the magnetic Gr\"{u}neisen ratio $\Gamma_H$, are powerful probes to study the nature of quantum phase transitions. Here, we propose a Gr\"{u}neisen parameter, the rotational Gr\"{u}neisen ratio $\Gamma_\phi$, by introducing the orientation of the external field as a control parameter. We investigate $\Gamma_\phi$ of the highly anisotropic paramagnets CeRhSn and CeIrSn by measuring the rotational magnetocaloric effect in a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. We find that the $\Gamma_\phi$ data of both compounds are scaled by using the same critical exponents and the field-invariant critical field angle. Remarkably, the scaling function for the $\Gamma_\phi$ data reveals the presence of highly anisotropic quantum criticality that develops as a function of the easy-axis component of the magnetic field from the quantum critical line. This paper provides a thermodynamic approach to detect and identify magnetic quantum criticality in highly anisotropic systems.

Abstract: We investigate the Cr electronic structure and excitations in CrSBr, a layered magnetic semiconductor, using a combination of resonant x-ray spectroscopic techniques. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra collected at the Cr $L_{2,3}$ edges reveal significant linear dichroism, which arises from the distorted octahedral environment surrounding the Cr$^{3+}$ ions. The origin of the bright excitons observed in this compound is examined through a comparison of the d-d excitations identified in the RIXS spectra, the x-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) spectra, and previously reported optical spectroscopic and theoretical studies. To further understand these phenomena, we develop a multiplet model based on a crystal electric field (CEF) approach that accounts for the local environment of Cr ions. This model successfully reproduces several experimental features, while also suggesting strong hybridization effects between Cr $3\textit{d}$ orbitals and ligands that are not fully captured by the present framework. These findings advance our understanding of the electronic structure and excitonic behavior in CrSBr and provide a foundation for future $\textit{in-situ}$ and $\textit{operando}$ studies of CrSBr-based devices for spintronic and optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: We explore the competition between light-mediated and intrinsic matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting transmission line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls the intrinsic correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T > 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission reflects also a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons.

Abstract: Light, composed of massless photons, in addition to energy, carries linear and angular momentum, enabling it to exert forces and torques on matter. Recent advances in light-matter interactions particularly on optical torques and angular momentum transport, indicate considerable current interest. In this paper we consider optical torques exerted by elliptically polarized plane waves and related spin angular momentum transport. Using a classical approach using only Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force, we derive expressions for radiation pressure and areal torque density on dielectric slabs and waveplates. Our results provide a clear identity linking incident, reflected, and transmitted light fields to spin angular momentum density and its conservation. Our results should help resolve ambiguities in the literature, affirming the presence of spin angular momentum in elliptically polarized plane waves and highlighting the utility of classical electromagnetic theory in exploring optomechanical phenomena.

Abstract: 3D additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of nanophotonic structures with subwavelength features that control light across macroscopic scales. Gradient-based optimization offers an efficient approach to design these complex and non-intuitive structures. However, expanding this methodology from 2D to 3D introduces complexities, such as the need for structural integrity and connectivity. This work introduces a multi-objective optimization method to address these challenges in 3D nanophotonic designs. Our method combines electromagnetic simulations with an auxiliary heat-diffusion solver to ensure continuous material and void connectivity. By modeling material regions as heat sources and boundaries as heat sinks, we optimize the structure to minimize the total temperature, thereby penalizing disconnected regions that cannot dissipate thermal loads. Alongside the optical response, this heat metric becomes part of our objective function. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by designing two 3D nanophotonic devices. The first is a focusing element. The second is a waveguide junction, which connects two incoming waveguides for two different wavelengths into two outgoing waveguides, which are rotated by 90{\deg} to the incoming waveguides. Our approach offers a design pipeline that generates digital blueprints for fabricable nanophotonic materials, paving the way for practical 3D nanoprinting applications.

Abstract: An adequate modelling of the electromagnetic interaction of the plasma with the surrounding conductors is paramount for the correct reproduction of 3D plasma dynamics. Simulations of the latter provide in turn useful predictions regarding the plasma evolution, the related MHD modes leading to disruptions and the electromagnetic forces acting on the vacuum vessel's components when said disruptions occur. The latest modelling efforts with the 3D FEM non-linear JOREK code have been directed towards the eddy current coupling of a reduced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma model with thin and volumetric wall codes (STARWALL and CARIDDI). In this contribution, we present an eddy current coupling between the full MHD model of JOREK and the STARWALL code; this new coupling scheme describes the full three-dimensional interactions of the plasma with the vacuum region and external conductors, modeled by natural boundary conditions linking the magnetic vector potential $\mathbf{A}$ to the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. The consistency of the new coupling scheme is validated via benchmarks for axisymmetric Vertical Displacement Events and multi-harmonics simulations of MHD modes.

Abstract: The interaction of fast charged particles with graphene layers can generate electromagnetic modes. This wake effect has been recently proposed for short-wavelength, high-gradient particle acceleration and for obtaining brilliant radiation sources. In this study, the excitation of wakefields produced by a point-like charged particle moving parallel to a multilayer graphene array (which may be supported by an insulated substrate) is studied using the linearized hydrodynamic theory. General expressions for the excited longitudinal and transverse wakefields have been derived. The dependencies of the wakefields on the positions of the layers and the substrate, the velocity and the surface density have been extensively analyzed. This study provides a deeper understanding of the physical phenomena underlying plasmonic excitations in graphene layers, paving the way for potential applications of these structures in particle acceleration, nanotechnology and materials science.

Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are an exciting platform for on-demand quantum, and classical optoelectronic and photonic devices. However, their potential success is limited by the extreme sensitivity and low stability arising from their weak intrinsic lattice bond energy and complex surface chemistry. Here we report a novel platform of buried perovskite quantum dots (b-PQDs) in a three-dimensional perovskite thin-film, fabricated using one-step, flash annealing, which overcomes surface related instabilities in colloidal perovskite dots. The b-PQDs demonstrate ultrabright and stable single-dot emission, with resolution-limited linewidths below 130 {\mu}eV, photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.1), no blinking, suppressed spectral diffusion, and high photon count rates of 10^4/s, consistent with unity quantum yield. The ultrasharp linewidth resolves exciton fine-structures (dark and triplet excitons) and their dynamics under a magnetic field. Additionally, b-PQDs can be electrically driven to emit single photons with 1 meV linewidth and photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.4). These results pave the way for on-chip, low-cost single-photon sources for next generation quantum optical communication and sensing.

Abstract: The intersection of art and science offers novel ways to interpret and represent complex phenomena. This project explores the convergence of high-energy astrophysics, concrete poetry, and natural language processing (NLP) by proposing a Markov chain-based algorithm that generates poetic texts from gamma-ray emission maps of the universe. Gamma rays, the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, arise from violent astrophysical processes such as supernovae, pulsars, and black hole accretion, observable through instruments like the \textit{Fermi Large Area Telescope} (FermiLAT). These high-energy events are mapped and processed into matrices, treated as Markov chains, where each state's transition probability is determined by the intensity of gamma-ray sources in a region of interest.

Abstract: Long-range magnetic ordering of the orbital motion of oxygen atoms within NO$_3$$^-$ cations is identified from experimental measurements of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$($T$) in LiNO$_3$, Ca(NO$_3$)$_2$, K$_{0.5}$Rb$_{0.5}$NO$_3$ and C(NH$_2$)$_3$NO$_3$ at their respective order-disorder, solid-solid phase transitions $T$$_N$. The observed sharp changes in $\chi$($T$) and accompanying hysteretic behavior indicate the phase transitions to be first order. A model employing the law of conservation of angular momentum is used to explain why the librations between neighboring NO$_3$$^-$ become geared below $T$$_N$. Since the periodic motions involve concerted motion of net charges, the associated magnetic moments of the NO$_3$$^-$ ions indirectly establish an antiferromagnetic structure below $T$$_N$. Our findings identify a previously unidentified type of molecular interaction which may be exploited to further increase the enthalpy of the widely-popular hydrated salts employed as energy storage devices.

Abstract: Quantum sensors offer exceptional sensitivity to nanoscale magnetic field fluctuations, where non-stationary effects such as spin diffusion and non-Markovian dynamics arising from coupling to few environmental degrees of freedom play critical roles. Here, we demonstrate how quantum sensors can characterize the statistical properties of noise sources, distinguishing between stationary and non-stationary behaviors, as well as Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a platform, we develop a physical noise model that analytically predicts Ramsey decay curves under different noise regimes. These predictions are experimentally validated by measuring Ramsey decay for NV centers subject to injected noise of each type. Our results showcase the capability of quantum sensors to unravel complex noise behaviors induced by nanoscale environments, shedding light on their physical origins and guiding the development of strategies to mitigate decoherence. This work deepens our understanding of noise dynamics at the nanoscale and lays the foundation for enhancing the performance and robustness of quantum technologies.

Abstract: Magneto-optical techniques have become essential tools in spintronics, enabling the investigation of spin dynamics in the ultrafast regime. A key challenge in this field has been to accurately isolate the contributions to magneto-optical signals of spin transport phenomena from the local magnetization dynamics. The contribution of transported and accumulated spins was long believed to be orders of magnitude smaller than that of the magnetization and thus previous approaches to disentangle these signals have relied on specific experimental designs, usually including thick metal layers. Here, we present experimental evidence demonstrating that the magneto-optical signal from ultrafast spin accumulations can, under certain conditions, be comparable to or even exceed that of the magnetic layer in a standard ultrafast demagnetization experiment. Our findings provide a new framework for accessing and isolating these spin accumulations, allowing for time and depth dependent probing of transported spin and/or orbital angular momentum.

Abstract: We present an open-source simulation framework for optically detected magnetic resonance, developed in Python. The framework allows users to construct, manipulate, and evolve multipartite quantum systems that consist of spins and electronic levels. We provide an interface for efficient time-evolution in Lindblad form as well as a framework for facilitating simulation of spatial and generalized stochastic dynamics. Further, symbolic operator construction and propagation is supported for simple model systems making the framework also ideal for use in classroom instruction of magnetic resonance. Designed to be backend-agnostic, the library leverages existing Python libraries as computational backends. We introduce the most important functionality and illustrate the syntax on a series of examples. These include systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and photo-generated spin-correlated radical pairs for which our library offers system-specific sub-modules.

Abstract: Here we investigate epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 ferroelectric thin films as potential candidates to be used as non-volatile electric-field-modulated thermal memories. The electric-field dependence of the thermal conductivity of metal/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/YSZ devices is found to be hysteretic, resembling the polarization vs electric field hysteresis loops, being maximum (minimum) at large applied positive (negative) voltages from the top metallic electrode. This dynamic thermal response is compatible with the coupling between the ferroelectric polarization and the oxygen ion migration, in which the oxygen vacancies are the main phonon scattering sources and the polarization acts as an electrically active ion migration barrier that creates the hysteresis. This new mechanism enables two non-volatile thermal states: high (ON) and low (OFF) thermal conductivity, with an ON/OFF ratio of 1.6. Both the ON and OFF states exhibit high stability over time, though the switching speed is limited by ion mobility in the YSZ electrode.

Abstract: Photons in vacuum are transverse in any inertial frame; longitudinal photons only exist virtually. By developing a manifestly covariant theory for electromagnetic excitations in relativistic plasmas and applying Wigner's little group method for elementary particle classifications, we show that photons in plasmas are neither transverse nor longitudinal; they are oblique. Plasmons are electromagnetic and oblique as well. The Lorentz invariant characteristics that distinguishes photons and plasmons is covariant compressibility. The manifestly covariant theory predicts the existence of the current-plasmon, a third oblique, electromagnetic eigenmode, and it also enables the study of photon topology in plasmas. Plasmas remove the photon's Dirac point in vacuum by giving it an effective mass, but create a tilted Dirac-Weyl point by reviving the virtual longitudinal photon. The manifest covariance of the theory demonstrates that relativistic transparency, despite being widely studied, does not exist in plasmas.

Abstract: A quasi-linear reduced transport model is developed from a database of high-$\beta$ electromagnetic nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations performed with Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) relevant parameters. The quasi-linear model is fully electromagnetic and accounts for the effect of equilibrium flow shear using a novel approach. Its flux predictions are shown to agree quantitatively with predictions from local nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations across a broad range of STEP-relevant local equilibria. This reduced transport model is implemented in the T3D transport solver that is used to perform the first flux-driven simulations for STEP to account for transport from hybrid-KBM turbulence, which dominates over a wide region of the core plasma. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of the final transport steady state from T3D return turbulent fluxes that are consistent with the reduced model, indicating that the quasi-linear model may also be appropriate for describing the transport steady state. Within the assumption considered here, our simulations support the existence of a transport steady state in STEP with a fusion power comparable to that in the burning flat-top of the conceptual design, but do not demonstrate how this state can be accessed.

Abstract: Chirality, a fundamental concept describing an object cannot superpose with its mirror image, is crucial in optics and photonics and leads to various exotic phenomena, such as circular dichroism, and optical activity. Recent findings reveal that, besides electric and magnetic dipoles, toroidal dipoles, an elusive part of dynamic multipoles, can also contribute significantly to chirality. However, as toroidal dipoles are typically represented by solenoidal currents circulating on a three-dimensional (3D) torus, toroidal circular dichroism is usually observed in 3D intricate microstructures. Facing corresponding challenges in fabrication, integration and application, it is generally difficult to employ toroidal circular dichroism in compact metasurfaces for flexible modulation of chiral interactions between electromagnetic waves and matter. To overcome these stringent challenges, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the giant toroidal circular dichroism in a bilayer metasurface that is comprised of only planar layers, effectively bypassing various restrictions imposed by 3D microstructures. With the introduction of a displacement, or bilayer offset, between the opposite layers, we experimentally achieve giant chiral responses with the intrinsic circular dichroism (CD) reaching 0.69 in measurements, and the CD can be quantitatively manipulated in a simple manner. The giant intrinsic chirality primarily originates from distinct excitations of in-plane toroidal dipole moments under circular polarized incidences, and the toroidal chiral response is quantitatively controlled by the bilayer offset. Therefore, our work provides a straightforward and versatile approach for development of giant and flexible intrinsic chirality through toroidal dipoles with inherently planar layers, important for applications in communications, sensing, and chiroptical devices.

Abstract: Turbulence driven by gyrokinetic instabilities is largely responsible for transport in magnetic fusion devices. To estimate this turbulent transport, integrated modeling codes often use mixing length estimates in conjunction with reduced models of the linearized gyrokinetic equation. One common method of formulating and solving the linearized gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem equation uses a Ritz variational principle, particularly in the local collisionless limit. However, the variational principle as typically stated in the literature is mathematically incorrect. In this work, we derive a mathematically correct form of the variational principle that applies to local linear collisionless gyrokinetics in general geometry with electromagnetic effects. We also explicitly derive a weak form of the gyrokinetic field equations suitable for numerical applications.

The resulting numerical MICD data is in contrast to other numerically obtained MICDs computed via the wave function route, virtually divergence-free.

Abstract: The Landau states of electrons with orbital angular momentum in magnetic fields are important in the quantum theories of metals and of synchrotron radiation at storage rings, in relativistic astrophysics of neutron stars, and in many other areas. In realistic scenarios, electrons are often born inside the field or injected from a field-free region, requiring nonstationary quantum states to account for boundary or initial conditions. This study presents nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) states in a longitudinal magnetic field, characterizing vortex electrons after their transfer from vacuum to the field. Comparisons with Landau states and calculations of observables such as mean energy and r.m.s. radius show that the r.m.s. radius of the electron packet in the NSLG state oscillates in time around a significantly larger value than that of the Landau state. This quantum effect of oscillations is due to boundary conditions and can potentially be observed in various problems, particularly when using magnetic lenses of electron microscopes and linear accelerators. Analogies are drawn between a quantum wave packet and a classical beam of many particles in phase space, including the calculation of mean emittance of the NSLG state as a measure of their quantum nature.

Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.

Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.

Abstract: Twisting two-dimensional van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin-textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, we consider pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, we fabricate symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures. The magneto-transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist-angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non-volatile magnetic memory at zero-field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin-switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results highlight the combination between twist-angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin-switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest towards the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.

# Magnetic Field-Assisted Fe Nanowire Conformable Aerogels Galvanically Displaced to Cu and Pt for 3-Dimensional Electrode Applications

## 磁场辅助的Fe纳米线整合气凝胶电置换为Cu和Pt，用于三维电极应用

**Authors:** Joshua A., Maurer

There is an increasing need for free-standing, conformal electrodes for practical energy storage devices. To address this, we demonstrate the magnetic field-assisted synthesis of interpenetrating Fe nanowire (FeNW) gels without the use of templates or composite scaffold material over a range of magnetic fields. In either a wet gel or supercritical dried state as an aerogel, the FeNWs may be pressed into thin or conformal films. Varying the applied magnetic field strength with a solenoid during chemical synthesis resulted in increased nanowire length and local orientation of the FeNWs with increasing magnetic field strength, with approximately 80 nm diameters across field strengths of 0-150 mT. Flowing K2PtCl4 or CuSO45H2O solutions through the wet iron gels to achieve the near complete galvanic displacement of iron to the more noble [PtCl4]2- and Cu2+ ions resulted in either platinum nanotubes (PtNTs) or copper nanowires (CuNWs) while maintaining a percolating network structure. Similar to the FeNW gels, the PtNT and CuNW gels were able to be supercritical dried and/or pressed into thin or conformal electrode films. CuNW and PtNT films demonstrated good potential as capacitive and oxygen reduction reaction electrodes, respectively. The magnetic field assisted synthesis of ferromagnetic iron nanowires offers a simple, rapid and tunable method, that when combined with galvanic displacement with more noble metal ions, may enable a wide range of metal, alloy, and multi-metallic nanowires and nanotubes for energy storage, sensing and catalytic applications.

# Evaluating the Health and Fitness Benefits of a 6-Month FES-Cycling Program on a Recumbent Trike for Individuals with Motor Complete SCI: A Pilot Study

## 在横卧三轮车上评估为期6个月的FES骑行计划对运动完全SCI患者的健康和健身益处: 一项初步研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5795260/latest

Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) severely affects physical function, leading to muscle atrophy and reduced bone density. Sport-therapy, incorporating recreational and competitive activities, has shown promise in enhancing recovery for individuals with SCI. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES)-cycling combines exercise benefits with stimulation advantages, and recent integration with mobile recumbent trikes adds further potential. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 6-month FES-cycling sport therapy using a recumbent trike on individuals with motor complete SCI.
Methods: Five participants engaged in bi-weekly FES-cycling sessions using an instrumented recumbent trike. A comprehensive assessment was conducted before training, at 3 and 6 months of training, and at 1-month follow-up. Outcome measures included maximal muscle Cross-Sectional Area (maxCSA) from Magnetic Resonance Images, bone mineral density, clinical scales, and questionnaires on spasticity, pain, bowel dysfunction, psychological well-being, and sport motivation. Additionally, maximal power output and cycling endurance were assessed.
Results: The FES-cycling program led to a significant increase in muscle mass of 34% after 6 months of training, correlated to an improved cycling performance (maxCSA versus peak power). A slight decrease of muscle mass was observed as expected at follow-up. Participants reported high well-being and strong motivation throughout the training program. Bone health, spasticity, bowel dysfunction, and pain levels did not significantly change overall.
Conclusions: FES-cycling on a recumbent trike shows potential as a therapeutic and recreational activity for individuals with SCI. It significantly improved muscle mass and physical performance while positively impacting psychological well-being and motivation. Further research with larger cohorts is necessary to confirm these benefits and optimize protocols, establishing FES-cycling as a valuable sport-therapy model for SCI.
Trial registration: The study protocol was retrospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06321172) due to technical issue.

# A Hybrid Prediction Method for Conducted EMI in AC-DC Power Converter

## Ac-dc功率变换器传导EMI的混合预测方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5786716/latest

This paper proposes a hybrid prediction method for the conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) of AC-DC power converter. Under this method, the equivalent EMI model of AC-DC converter system is established to separate interference source and conduction path in the converter. For the front stage rectifier with T type topology, a topology simplification method is applied to develop a time-domain model of the interference source with consideration given to variable slope characteristics and ringing effects. When modeling DC-DC converter stage, main interference source in time domain is built from the perspective of capacitor charging and discharging. Experimental verification is performed to obtain the results that are consistent with the analytical results obtained by using the proposed modeling method. Furthermore, frequency-domain prediction techniques are applied to forecast the conducted EMI of the converter. Finally, a comprehensive comparison is performed with other prediction method to demonstrate the advantage of this hybrid prediction method in accuracy, simulation speed and convergence.

# Observations of the 2021/2022 La Ni&ntilde;a mass coral bleaching event on the soft coral genus Sarcophyton at Magnetic Island (Australia)

## 在磁岛 (澳大利亚) 的软珊瑚属Sarcophyton上观察到2021/2022的拉尼娜大规模珊瑚漂白事件

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5765630/latest

Coral reef ecosystems are declining globally due to climate change. As most ecological studies have focused on stony corals, the distribution of other benthic communities and their susceptibility to bleaching remain largely overlooked. Soft corals can form diverse and ecologically important assemblages; hence it is important to understand their distribution and quantify the impacts of heatwaves on soft coral demographics. We surveyed soft corals on two inshore fringing reefs: Geoffrey Bay (19&amp;deg;09'13.7"S, 146&amp;deg;52'09.5"E) and Alma Bay (19&amp;deg;08'52.9"S, 146&amp;deg;52'13.7"E) at Magnetic Island. We aimed to survey soft corals to genus level. Then, we quantified the size frequency distribution of Sarcophyton colonies as the most abundant genus between substrate types, and examined the susceptibility of Sarcophyton to bleaching during the La Ni&amp;ntilde;a mass coral bleaching event in January-March 2022. We found the reefs at Magnetic Island to support diverse soft coral communities. Sarcophyton was one of the dominant soft coral genera on rock, rubble and sand beds, and colonies of all sizes experienced bleaching. Bleaching occurrence was lower in Alma Bay than Geoffrey Bay (26.66% and 52.27% of Sarcophyton colonies bleached, respectively). Bleaching was found to be depth- and size-dependent, as deeper and larger colonies had a greater likelihood to bleach. Since larger Sarcophyton colonies were more susceptible to bleaching, the impacts on reproduction, mortality and ecosystem functioning are likely to be significant. This is the first assessment of the soft corals at Magnetic Island and of the susceptibility of a common soft coral genus on the GBR to bleaching.

# Investigations on structural and electrical properties of ZnO based nanoparticles and composite

## ZnO基纳米粒子及其复合材料的结构和电性能研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5797355/latest

Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) have emerged as promising candidates for spintronic devices, offering a unique combination of semiconducting and magnetic properties. In the present study, ZnO (Z) and Zn0.2Cu0.8O (C) nanostructured materials were synthesized using sol&amp;ndash;gel and co&amp;ndash;precipitation methods, respectively. Their composite, ZnO: Zn0.2Cu0.8O (ZC), was fabricated to investigate the structural and electrical properties. X&amp;ndash;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the hexagonal wurtzite phase and reveals a reduced crystallite size and suppressed lattice strain across the lattice of ZC composite, as compared to the pure phases (i.e. Z &amp;amp; C). Rietveld refinements and Williamson&amp;ndash;Hall (W&amp;ndash;H) analysis further established changes in lattice parameters and strain effect. The dielectric constant, measured for a frequency range between 20 Hz and 2 MHz, shows a significant enhancement in its values for composite material which can be attributed to the interfacial polarization and oxygen vacancies. Impedance spectroscopy reveals lower impedance in the ZC composite indicating better conduction pathways due to enhanced defect density and grain boundary interactions. AC conductivity, analyzed using Jonscher's power law, demonstrates that the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) mechanism governs the conduction, with ZC composite sample exhibiting the highest conductivity among all the three samples. These findings suggest that the composite exhibits improved dielectric and electrical performance due to synergistic effects between ZnO and Zn0.2Cu0.8O phases, making it a promising material for electronic and optoelectronic applications.

# Validating 70 Million Years of Convection Driven True Polar Wander and Dynamic Flattening with Paleomagnetic Data

## 用古地磁数据验证7000万年的对流驱动真极地漂移和动态展平

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5397333/latest

Mantle convection drives changes in Earth's ellipsoidal figure and corresponding moment of inertia, causing shifts in the planet's rotation axis known as true polar wander (TPW). Using seismic tomography and the Back-and-Forth Nudging (BFN) method, we developed a time-dependent convection model that reconstructs the evolution of mantle density distribution and Earth&rsquo;s moment of inertia over the past 70 million years. This modelling approach provides a close match with independent paleomagnetic constraints on the Cenozoic shifts of Earth&rsquo;s rotation pole, specifically resolving the previously unexplained U-turn in TPW trajectory at approximately 50 million years ago. Our findings reveal TPW shifts exceeding 5 degrees, despite the temporal stability imposed by high lower-mantle viscosity and the stabilizing effect of Earth's remnant rotational bulge. Verification of our predicted changes in Earth&rsquo;s ellipsoidal figure through independent paleomagnetic data provides a robust calibration for new predictions of convection-induced dynamic flattening variations. Over the past 70 million years, we find convection-induced changes of flattening that shift from -0.2% to +0.1 % during the Paleogene. Our predictions of Earth's axial precession frequency in the Paleogene align with recent independent cyclostratigraphic studies, thus validating our model's accuracy and supporting the hypothesis of reduced luni-solar tidal dissipation during this period.
