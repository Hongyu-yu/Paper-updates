Abstract: Weexperimentally realize the continuously controllable dissipative coupling and coherent coupling induced by different magnon modes and the same anti-resonance. It has been observed that the weaker the microwave magnetic field distribution of the magnon mode in magnetic materials, the more likely dissipative coupling is to occur. Conversely, stronger magnetic field distributions favor coherent coupling. Based on this principle, we have designed and implemented a system that alternates between dissipative and coherent coupling regimes. It allows microwave signals to be selectively transmitted over a large applied magnetic field range at the frequency of anti-resonance. Our experimental achievements may promote the construction of new magnonics devices like magnetic-tuning switch.

Abstract: Topological defects are the key feature mediating 2D phase transitions. However, both resolution and tunability have been lacking to access the dynamics of the transitions. With dynamic Kerr microscopy, we directly capture the melting of a confined 2D magnetic skyrmion lattice with high resolution in real-time and -space. Skyrmions in magnetic thin films are two-dimensional, topologically non-trivial quasi-particles that provide rich dynamics as well as unique tunability as an essential ingredient for controlling phase behavior: We tune the skyrmion size and effective temperature on the fly to drive the two-step melting through an intermediate hexatic regime between the solid lattice and the isotropic liquid. We quantify the characteristic occurrence of topological defects mediating the transitions and reveal the so-far inaccessible dynamics of the lattice dislocations. The full real-time and -space imaging reveals the diffusion coefficient of the dislocations, which we find to be orders of magnitudes higher than that of the skyrmions.

Abstract: The development of Kondo lattice coherence in UTe2 leads to the formation of a heavy Fermi liquid state from which superconductivity emerges at lower temperature. In Kondo lattice systems, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon Knight shift have proven to be particularly sensitive to the properties of the developing heavy-electron fluid. Here we report muon Knight shift measurements on high-quality UTe2 single crystals grown by a molten salt-flux method. Together with previous data from a single crystal grown by a chemical-vapor transport method, our results show the contribution of the heavy-electron liquid to the muon Knight shift increases below a crossover temperature T* ~ 30 K in accord with a universal scaling function of T/T* for heavy-fermion materials. An observed departure from this universal scaling below a temperature T ~ 12 K at certain muon stopping sites signifies a reversal of the Kondo hybridization and a relocalization of U 5f moments with an antiferromagnetic coupling. The preservation of universal scaling at a different muon site demonstrates a coexistence of itinerant and localized 5f electron states preceding the superconducting phase transition.

Abstract: On the kagome lattice, electrons benefit from the simultaneous presence of band topology, flat electronic bands, and van Hove singularities, forming competing or cooperating orders. Understanding the interrelation between these distinct order parameters remains a significant challenge, leaving much of the associated physics unexplored. In the kagome superconductor KV3Sb5, which exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) state below T = 78 K, we uncover an unpredicted field-induced phase transition below 6 K. The observed transition is marked by a hysteretic anomaly in the resistivity, nonlinear electrical transport, and a change in the symmetry of the electronic response as probed via the angular dependence of the magnetoresistivity. These observations surprisingly suggest the emergence of an unanticipated broken symmetry state coexisting with the original CDW. To understand this experimental observation, we developed a theoretical minimal model for the normal state inside the high-temperature parent CDW phase where an incommensurate CDW order emerges as an instability sub-leading to superconductivity. The incommensurate CDW emerges when superconducting fluctuations become fully suppressed by large magnetic fields. Our results suggest that, in kagome superconductors, quantum states can either coexist or are nearly degenerate in energy, indicating that these are rich platforms to expose new correlated phenomena.

Abstract: Realizing ferromagnetic semiconductors with room Curie temperature $T\rm_C$ remains a challenge in spintronics. Inspired by the recent experimental progress on the nanotubes based on 2D van der Waals non-magnetic transition-metal dichalcogenides, magnetic nanotubes based on monolayer ferromagnetic materials are highly possible. Here, we proposed a way how to obtain high $T\rm_C$ ferromagnetic semiconductor nanotubes. Some high $T\rm_C$ ferromagnetic semiconductors are predicted in the MX$_2$ nanotubes (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; X = S, Se, Te), including CrS$_2$ and CrTe$_2$ zigzag nanotubes with the diameter of 18 unit cells showing $T\rm_C$ above 300 K. In addition, due to the strain gradient in walls of nanotubes, an electrical polarization at level of $0.1$ eV/\AA~inward of the radial direction is obtained. Our results not only present novel ferromagnetic semiconductor nanotubes with room Curie temperature but also be indicative of how to obtain such nanotubes based on experimentally obtained 2D high $T\rm_C$ ferromagnetic metals.

Abstract: Magnetic rare earth atoms on pyrochlore lattice can produce such exotic magnetic states as spin ice and quantum spin ice. These states are a result of the frustration in the pyrochlore lattice, as well as crystal field degrees of freedom of rare earth atoms, and their interactions with the lattice. Raman scattering spectroscopy, which possess high spectral resolution and can easily access broad energy and temperature ranges, is an optimum tool to study these excitations and their interactions. In this work we follow Raman scattering of zone center phonons and crystal field excitations of Nd$^{3+}$ in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ in the temperature range where these materials are paramagnetic. A comparison between an insulating Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and semimetallic Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ materials allow us to distinguish between scattering of phonons on other phonons, crystal field excitations, and electrons, highlighting interactions between these degrees of freedom.

Abstract: External pressure suppresses the ferromagnetism of localized Cr 3d electron moments in the van der Waals insulator CrBr3, which cannot be explained without considering a dramatic pressure-induced crystal or electronic structure change. We addressed this issue by conducting a parallel experimental investigation of single crystals magnetic and structural properties using magnetization, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy measurements. Ab initio DFT calculations of electronic structure and atomistic simulations of finite-temperature magnetism supported the analysis and interpretation of experimental results. The magnetization measurements at high pressures provided the first direct experimental evidence of the pressure-induced suppression of ferromagnetism. We observed a gradual decrease of the bulk magnetic moment and Curie temperature with increasing pressure, which accelerates at pressures above 3 GPa, leading to loss of ferromagnetism at 6.5 GPa. By increasing pressure, the ambient pressure phase gradually breaks down and is accompanied by the generation of layer stacking that favor the antiferromagnetic coupling of Cr moments. As a result, the appearing antiparallel pairs of moments disturb the ferromagnetic structure and reduce the bulk magnetic moment and Curie temperature. This scenario, which is well corroborated by the results of our theoretical calculations, suggests an antiferromagnetic phase emerging with increasing pressure beyond the critical value when the new single trigonal P-3m1 phase becomes stable, characterized by the "antiferromagnetic" A-A layer stacking, becomes stable. The weak coupling between adjacent magnetic layers in van der Waals materials allows variations in layering due to sufficient external forces. We hope our comprehensive study's results can help other researchers resolve frequently appearing issues of similar origin in this class of materials.

# An Alternative Model For Topologically-Stable Magnetic Skyrmions

arXiv:2501.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main quantities which describe the topological properties of magnetic Skyrmion is the Skyrmion number density, $q$. In this work, we study an alternative model of a two-dimensional magnetic system where the dynamics of the spins explicitly depend on $q$ and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is omitted. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics is employed for the micromagnetic calculations and it is found that one of the possible static lowest energy configurations of the proposed model is a Skyrmion with a topological charge equal to one. This lowest energy configuration is stable under small linear perturbation and it is shown that the total energy of the system is bounded from below such that it is always higher than the vacuum energy, implying a topologically protected configuration. The alternative model is an effective model for Skyrmions in two-dimensional systems. We also propose that this model can be used for magnetic systems under a strong external magnetic field where the ordinary exchange interactions are much weaker than the Zeeman effect.

Abstract: The realization of two-dimensional multiferroics offers significant potential for nanoscale device functionality. However, type-I two-dimensional multiferroics with strong magnetoelectric coupling, enabling electric field control of spin, remain scarce. In this study, using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that the niobium phthalocyanine covalent organic framework (NbPc COF) monolayer exhibits type-I multiferroic behavior, with a ferroelectric transition occurring above room temperature. Remarkably, the strong magnetoelectric coupling in NbPc COF monolayer arises from the same origin of magnetism and ferroelectricity. Our findings offer flexible pathways for the design and development of organic nanoscale multiferroic devices with broad applications.

arXiv:2501.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the thermal and electrical conductivity data for the magnetic Weyl semimetal SmAlSi measured in a magnetic field (B) with two different orientations. In one case, B was applied perpendicular to the heat or charge current, in the other they were parallel. For both configurations, the magnetic field affects the magnetic structure identically as B is always parallel to the equivalent tetragonal axis. Our results indicate that phonon heat transport in response to the magnetic field exhibits strong anisotropy at low temperature: it appears to be independent of B in the perpendicular configuration but is strongly suppressed in the parallel configuration. Understanding this unusual behaviour can lead to designing better materials for thermoelectricity or directional heat switches.

Abstract: Quantum geometric tensor (QGT) reflects the geometry of the eigenstates of a system's Hamiltonian. The full characterization of QGT is essential for various quantum systems. However, it is challenging to characterize the QGT of the solid-state systems. Here we present a scheme by using spin-polarized STM to measure QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems, in which the spin texture is extracted from geometric amplitudes of Friedel oscillations induced by the intentionally introduced magnetic impurity and then the QGT is derived from the momentum differential of spin texture. The surface states of topological insulator (TISS), as a model spin system, is promising to demonstrate the scheme. In a TI slab, the gapped TISS host finite quantum metric and Berry curvature as the symmetric real part and the antisymmetric imaginary part of QGT, respectively. Thus, a detailed calculations guide the use of the developed scheme to measure the QGT of gapped TISS with or without an external in-plane magnetic field. This study provides a feasible scheme for measuring QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems, and hints at the great potential of the information extraction from the geometric amplitudes of STM and other measurement.

Abstract: Topologically nontrivial electronic states can give rise to novel anomalous Hall effects. The potential appearance of these effects at room temperature holds promise for their application in magnetic sensing, spintronics, and energy harvesting technology. The anomalous in-plane Hall effect (IPHE) is predicted to arise in topological magnetic materials when an external magnetic field is applied within the sample plane. Because of stringent symmetry requirements, the conclusive detection of the anomalous IPHE induced by topological electronic states remains challenging, and the study of anomalous Hall effects is often confined to cryogenic conditions. Combining molecular beam epitaxy of the kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn with measurements of the electric Hall effect and theoretical calculations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that the interplay of the kagome lattice motif with spin-orbit coupling and canted ferromagnetism with large exchange interactions gives rise to the anomalous IPHE at room temperature that is induced by topological Weyl points in the electronic band structure. Synthesizing a topological heterostructure including layers of Fe$_3$Sn and ferromagnetic CoFeB, we further show the enhancement of the anomalous IPHE through the magnetic stray field of the CoFeB layer. Our work establishes a design paradigm for topological magnets and heterostructures to discover and control novel anomalous Hall effects toward their use in technological applications.

Abstract: Altermagnetism has attracted considerable attention for its remarkable combination of spin-polarized band structures and zero net magnetization, making it a promising candidate for spintronics applications. We demonstrate that this magnetic phase represents a case of ``unconventional magnetism," first proposed nearly two decades ago by one of the present authors as part of a broader framework for understanding Landau-Pomeranchuk instabilities in the spin channel, driven by many-body interactions. By systematically analyzing the altermagnetism in RuO$_2$ with first-principles calculations, we reconcile conflicting experimental and theoretical reports by attributing it to RuO$_2$'s proximity to a quantum phase transition. We emphasize the critical role of tuning parameters, such as the Hubbard $U$, hole doping, and epitaxial strain, in modulating quasiparticle interactions near the Fermi surface. This work provides fresh insights into the origin and tunability of altermagnetism in RuO$_2$, highlighting its potential as a platform for investigating quantum phase transitions and the broader realm of unconventional magnetism.

Abstract: We report the emergence of a polar metal phase in layered van der Waals compound FePSe$_3$. This Mott insulator with antiferromagnetic order offers a unique opportunity to fully tune an insulator into a polar metal state with pressure, without doping-induced disorder or impurities. Our synchrotron and neutron diffraction data unambiguously show a structural transition and loss of the inversion symmetry. We also observed the suppression of magnetic ordering and an insulator-to-metal transition correspondent with this structural transformation. The loss of the inversion symmetry combined with the pressure-induced metallicity in FePSe$_3$ offers a new platform to investigate polar metallicity at accessible pressures. Moreover, the high-pressure metallic phase shows unconventional resistivity deviating from the Fermi-liquid description, close to the magnetic critical transition pressure at sufficiently low temperatures, which strongly suggests underlying quantum criticality. Our work not only explores the comprehensive temperature-pressure phase diagram of FePSe$_3$ but also provides insights for further investigation of van der Waals strongly correlated magnetic compounds.

Abstract: To lessen the quick depletion of fossil fuels and the resulting environmental harm, it is necessary to investigate effective and eco-friendly materials that can convert lost energy into electricity. The structural, optical, electronic, thermo-electric, and thermodynamic properties of the novel half-Heusler (HH) material NaVTe were examined in the current work using density functional theory (DFT). The Birch-Murnaghan equations of states were used to confirm the structural stability of the NaVTe HH alloy under investigation. These equations show that the compound in question has structural stability because its ground-state energy levels are negative. For spin-down configurations, NaVTe possesses an energy band gap of 3.2 eV, according to band structure and total density of state analysis. NaVTe is a material that is desirable for optoelectronic applications due to its optical features, which include maximum conductivity and absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The figure of merit and other thermodynamic and thermoelectric parameters are calculated. According to these predicted outcomes, the NaVTe HH alloy would be the ideal option for thermo-electric and renewable energy applications.

Abstract: Gauge invariance is of fundamental importance to make physically meaningful predictions. In superconductors, the use of mean-field Hamiltonians that lack $U(1)$ symmetry often leads to gauge-dependent results. While solutions to this problem for the linear response of conventional superconductors have been well-known, a unified understanding for unconventional superconductors or nonlinear responses has not been established. This study provides the full detail of the general theoretical framework that allows us to compute responses at arbitrary orders in external fields in a gauge-invariant manner for both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Our construction generalizes the consistent fluctuations of order parameters method for full photon vertices and has a pictorial illustration using Feynman diagrams of the response kernel.

Abstract: Magnetic measurements under high-pressure conditions are pivotal for the study of superconductivity and magnetic materials but remain challenging due to the micrometer-sized sample in diamond anvil cells (DAC). In this study, we propose a quantum sensing approach utilizing negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_B^-$) spin defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride for high resolution magnetic measurements under pressure. The optical and spin properties of VB$^-$ defects were systematically studied under high-pressure conditions, revealing a significant pressure-induced shift in zero-field splitting (ZFS), approximately three times larger than that of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. Furthermore, we demonstrate the pressure-dependent magnetic transition and variations in the Curie temperature of van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ flake using V$_B^-$ defects under pressures. Notably, the maximum operational pressure for V$_B^-$ defects was determined to be approximately 11 GPa, attributed to a structural phase transition in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This work establishes the way for two-dimensional quantum sensing technologies under high-pressure environments.

Abstract: The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects for the first time, through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.

Abstract: What happens when fermions hop on a lattice with crystalline defects? The answer depends on topological quantum numbers which specify the action of lattice rotations and translations in the low energy theory. One can understand the topological quantum numbers as a twist of continuum gauge fields in terms of crystalline gauge fields. We find that disclinations and dislocations -- defects of crystalline symmetries -- generally lead in the continuum to a certain ``emanant'' quantized magnetic flux. To demonstrate these facts, we study in detail tight-binding models whose low-energy descriptions are (2+1)D Dirac cones. Our map from lattice to continuum defects explains the crystalline topological response to disclinations and dislocations, and motivates the fermion crystalline equivalence principle used in the classification of crystalline topological phases. When the gap closes, the presence of emanant flux leads to pair creation from the vacuum with the particles and anti-particles swirling around the defect. We compute the associated currents and energy density using the tools of defect conformal field theory. There is a rich set of renormalization group fixed points, depending on how particles scatter from the defect. At half flux, there is a defect conformal manifold leading to a continuum of possible low-energy theories. We present extensive numerical evidence supporting the emanant magnetic flux at lattice defects and we test our map between lattice and continuum defects in detail. We also point out a no-go result, which implies that a single (2+1)D Dirac cone in symmetry class AII is incompatible with a commuting $C_M$ rotational symmetry with $(C_M)^M = +1$.

Abstract: Simulating the electromagnetic properties of large-scale, complex metamaterial structures demands significant time and memory resources. If these large-scale structures can be divided into smaller, simpler components, the overall cost of studying all the smaller structures could be much lower than directly simulating the entire structure. Unfortunately, decoupling complex structures has been challenging due to the unclear mechanisms of near-field coupling in metamaterials. In this paper, we identify that the key to understanding near-field coupling in metamaterials lies in evanescent wave interactions, which can be captured through full-wave simulations. Our findings suggest that by accounting for the influence of evanescent waves, it becomes possible to analytically decouple and then recouple structures, even when the types of metamaterial structures vary. Building on this insight, we successfully decomposed complex structures into multiple groups of simpler components. By studying these simpler components, the electromagnetic properties of the entire structure can be calculated analytically. This decoupling method dramatically reduces the computation time or memory required for research into the electromagnetic properties of metamaterials.

Abstract: In this work we study non-Hermitian extensions of the paradigmatic spin-1/2 XY chain in a magnetic field. Using the mapping of the model to free fermion form, we provide analytical insights into the energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian model and establish an intrinsic connection between the quasienergies and topological invariants. We also use exact diagonalization as a supplementary method to examine the performance of biorthogonal-based expectation values. Our results confirm that the theoretical analysis is consistent with the numerical results, with the extended phase diagram determined via the analytical solution and the critical behavior of the fidelity and entanglement. The entanglement transition goes hand in hand with the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. Like the Hermitian case, we analyze the critical behavior using finite-size scaling. Our results show that non-Hermiticity can induce the system into a new universality class with unusual critical exponent. We also emphasize the ability of the Loschmidt echo to characterize potential phase transitions and introduce the average of the Loschmidt echo to describe phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: The theory of anyon condensation is the foundation of the bulk-boundary relation and topological holography in 2+1D/1+1D. It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.

Abstract: We use magnetization measurements under pressure along with \textit{ab initio} and cluster many-body calculations to investigate magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$. Hydrostatic compression leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling $K_1$ and the corresponding increase in the off-diagonal anisotropy $\Gamma_1$, whereas the experimental Curie-Weiss temperature changes from negative to positive with the slope of +40~K/GPa. On the other hand, spin freezing persists up to at least 3.46~GPa with the almost constant freezing temperature of 5~K that does not follow the large changes in the exchange couplings and indicates the likely extrinsic origin of spin freezing. Magnetic frustration in Li$_2$RhO$_3$ is mainly related to the interplay between ferromagnetic $K_1$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma_1$, along with the weakness of the third-neighbor coupling $J_3$ that would otherwise stabilize zigzag order. The small $J_3$ distinguishes Li$_2$RhO$_3$ from other Kitaev candidates.

Abstract: In magnetic pyrochlore materials, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations, and geometrical frustration gives rise to exotic quantum phases, including topological semimetals and spin ice. While these phases have been observed in isolation, the interface-driven phenomena emerging from their interaction have never been realized previously. Here, we report on the discovery of interfacial electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a heterostructure consisting of the Weyl semimetal Eu2Ir2O7 and spin ice Dy2Ti2O7. Subjected to magnetic fields, we unveil a six-fold anisotropic transport response that is theoretically accounted by a Kondo-coupled heterointerface, where the spin ice's field-tuned magnetism induces electron scattering in the Weyl semimetal's topological Fermi-arc states. Furthermore, at elevated magnetic fields, we reveal a two-fold anisotropic response indicative of a new symmetry-broken many-body state. This discovery showcases the nascent potential of complex quantum architectures in search of emergent phenomena unreachable in bulk crystals.

Abstract: Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.

Abstract: We study theoretically Meissner effect in non-Hermitian systems of BCS type via superfluid stiffness. We show that depending on the values of the mean fields, chemical potential, and temperature, we obtain paramagnetic or diamagnetic Meissner effect. Notably, positive real part of the product of mean fields guarantees diamagnetic Meissner effect in an $s$-wave 3D non-Hermitian superconductor. Once the mean fields are close to being anti-Hermitian, 2D $s$-, $p_x$-, and $d$-wave superconductors exhibit interesting behaviour, including paramagnetic Meissner effect for certain parameters.

Abstract: We theoretically consider disorder and temperature effects on the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) using a variety of distinct and complementary analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, we address simple, physical, and experimentally relevant questions: How does disorder and/or temperature affect the IQHE plateau width? Does the plateau width increase or decrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the longitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the longitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there "floating" with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can disorder destroy the IQHE? Is there an IQHE to localization transition? What is the Landau level dependence of the plateau width? Our detailed theory provides answers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We discuss our results in the context of existing experimental results and suggest future experiments arising from our work. A key finding is that disorder and temperature are intrinsically connected in affecting IQHE, and there is an intricate interplay between them leading to nonmonotonicity in how the IQHE plateau width behaves as a function of increasing disorder. Both must be considered on an equal footing in understanding IQHE experiments.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic phase diagram of the bilayer triangular antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$, revealing a rich interplay among geometric frustration, bilayer coupling, and symmetry-driven phenomena. High-field magnetization measurements show fractional magnetization plateaus at 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 5/6 of the saturation magnetization. To elucidate the experimental magnetic phase diagram at low fields, we propose that K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ can be described as an easy-axis triangular weak-dimer antiferromagnet. We emphasize the critical role of the emergent $U(1) \otimes S_3$ symmetry, where $S_3 = \mathbb{Z}_3 \otimes \mathbb{Z}_2^d$, in determining the magnetic phases at low fields. The remarkable agreement between the experimental and theoretical phase diagrams suggests that the phase transitions are governed by this symmetry. Notably, our combined experimental and theoretical results identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase region at finite fields. These findings provide new insights into the phase structure of frustrated magnets and establish K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ as a compelling platform for exploring unconventional quantum phenomena in $U(1) \otimes S_3$ systems.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy rely on the magnetic fields generated by radiofrequency volume coils to acquire high-quality data. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of electromagnetic field behavior in RF volume coils is essential for optimizing imaging techniques and designing advanced coils. This study introduces a theoretical model for the magnetic field generated by a birdcage coil, based on a spherical geometry approach. To validate the proposed model, phantom images were acquired at different resonant frequencies, and the magnetic field produced by the RF coil was compared with experimental data. The results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the theoretical model, offering valuable insights into the behavior of electromagnetic fields in RF coils. This study provides a promising framework for further analysis and development of RF coil design, with significant implications for advancing both MRI and spectroscopy technologies.

Abstract: Exploration of the Universe requires communication with Earth, either on a direct path or through a cascade of proximate celestial bodies. Microwaves have traditionally been used for space communication, but electromagnetic waves of higher frequencies, such as in the optical domain, will enable probing farther in space due to their considerably lower diffraction loss. At a given data rate, the ultimate limit to point-to-point optical communication is determined by the received signal power and the photon information efficiency. The latter measures the number of information bits extracted per photon incident on a detector. As distances across space and, consequently, path loss increases, the system that can achieve the highest photon information efficiency will determine the longest distance at which communication is possible. We report here an experimental demonstration of optical detection at a record photon information efficiency of 14.5 bits per incident photon, or 17.8 bits per detected photon, after 87.5 dB of attenuation. Expressed in terms of energy per bit, this corresponds to 8.84 zeptojoules per bit, or 0.069 photons per bit at 1550 nm. To our knowledge, this is the highest photon information efficiency or lowest energy per bit detection system ever demonstrated at optical frequencies. Such a sensitive detection system holds promise for a wide range of applications.

**Authors:** Chengnian Huang, Wei E. I. Sha

arXiv:2501.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superior ability of nanostructures to manipulate light has propelled extensive applications in nano-electromagnetic components and devices. Computational electromagnetics plays a critical role in characterizing and optimizing the nanostructures. In this work, a parallel block preconditioner based volume integral equation (VIE)-fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm is proposed to model the electromagnetic response from representative nanostructures. The VIE using uniform Cartesian grids is first built, and then the entire volumetric domain is partitioned into geometric subdomains based on the regularity and topology of the nanostructure. The block diagonal matrix is thus established, whose inverse matrix serves as a preconditioner for the original matrix equation. The resulting linear system is solved by the bi-conjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGSTAB) method with different residual error tolerances in the inner and outer iteration processes; and the FFT algorithm is used to accelerate the matrix-vector product (MVM) operations throughout. Furthermore, because of the independence between the inner processes of solving block matrix equations, the OpenMP framework is empolyed to execute the parallel operations. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method is effective and reduces both the iteration number and the computational time significantly for the representative nano-electromagnetic problems like the dielectric focusing metasurfaces and the plasmonic solar cells.

Abstract: Precision determination of the hyperfine splitting of cadmium ions is essential to study space-time variation of fundamental physical constants and isotope shifts. In this work, we present the precision frequency measurement of the excited-state $^2{P}_{3/2}$ hyperfine splitting of $^{111,113}\mathrm{Cd}^+$ ions using the laser-induced fluorescence technique. By introducing the technology of sympathetic cooling and setting up free-space beat detection unit based on the optical comb, the uncertainties are improved to 14.8 kHz and 10.0 kHz, respectively, two orders of magnitude higher than the reported results from the linear transformation of isotope shifts. The magnetic dipole constants $A_{P_{3/2}}$ of $^{111}\mathrm{Cd}^+$ and $^{113}\mathrm{Cd}^+$ are estimated to be 395 938.8(7.4) kHz and 411 276.0(5.0) kHz, respectively. The difference between the measured and theoretical hyperfine structure constants indicates that more physical effects are required to be considered in the theoretical calculation, and provides critical data for the examination of deviation from King-plot linearity in isotope shifts.

Abstract: Polarization-analyzed small-angle neutron scattering (PASANS) is an advanced technique that enables the selective investigation of magnetic scattering phenomena in magnetic materials and distinguishes coherent scattering obscured by incoherent backgrounds, making it particularly valuable for cutting-edge research. The successful implementation of PASANS in China was achieved for the first time at the newly commissioned Very Small Angle Neutron Scattering (VSANS) instrument at the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). This technique employs a combination of a double-V cavity supermirror polarizer and a radio frequency (RF) neutron spin flipper to manipulate the polarization of the incident neutrons. The scattered neutron polarization is stably analyzed by a specially designed $\textit{in-situ}$ optical pumping $^{3}$He neutron spin filter, which covers a spatially symmetric scattering angle coverage of about 4.8 $^{\circ}$. A comprehensive PASANS data reduction method, aimed at pulsed neutron beams, has been established and validated with a silver behenate powder sample, indicating a maximum momentum transfer coverage of approximately 0.25 {\AA} $^{-1}$.

Abstract: Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristics of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence. One of the crucial reasons for the difference between the kinetic helicity effect on magnetic and scalar fields is related to the helicity dependence of the correlation time of a turbulent velocity field.

Abstract: This theoretical study explores resonant elastic photon scattering in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, motivated by potential applications in storage ring experiments, such as the Gamma Factory project at CERN. In this framework, resonant scattering involves head-on collisions of relativistic ion beams and counter-propagating laser photons, leading to a strong enhancement of the external field strength due to the Lorentz transformation between ion rest and laboratory frame. Calculations for He-like Ca ions reveal a notable impact of the external fields on the scattering rate as well as the angular distribution and polarization of emitted photons. This opens interesting avenues for diverse applications for the Gamma Factory project, such as as resonance condition tuning, beam cooling, and polarization control.

Abstract: The realization of two-dimensional multiferroics offers significant potential for nanoscale device functionality. However, type-I two-dimensional multiferroics with strong magnetoelectric coupling, enabling electric field control of spin, remain scarce. In this study, using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that the niobium phthalocyanine covalent organic framework (NbPc COF) monolayer exhibits type-I multiferroic behavior, with a ferroelectric transition occurring above room temperature. Remarkably, the strong magnetoelectric coupling in NbPc COF monolayer arises from the same origin of magnetism and ferroelectricity. Our findings offer flexible pathways for the design and development of organic nanoscale multiferroic devices with broad applications.

Abstract: We study the evolution of collisionless plasmas that, due to their macroscopic evolution, are susceptible to the firehose instability, using both analytic theory and hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. We establish that, depending on the relative magnitude of the plasma $\beta$, the characteristic timescale of macroscopic evolution, and the ion-Larmor frequency, the saturation of the firehose instability in high-$\beta$ plasmas can result in three qualitatively distinct thermodynamic (and electromagnetic) states. By contrast with the previously identified `ultra-high-beta' and `Alfv\'en-inhibiting' states, the newly identified `Alfv\'en-enabling' state, which is realised when the macroscopic evolution time $\tau$ exceeds the ion-Larmor frequency by a $\beta$-dependent parameter, can support linear Alfv\'en waves and Alfv\'enic turbulence because the magnetic tension associated with the plasma's macroscopic magnetic field is never completely negated by anisotropic pressure forces. We characterise these states in detail, including their saturated magnetic-energy spectra. The effective collision operator associated with the firehose fluctuations is also described; we find it to be well approximated in the Alfv\'en-enabling state by a simple quasilinear pitch-angle scattering operator. The box-averaged collision frequency is $\nu_{\rm eff} \sim \beta/\tau$, in agreement with previous results, but certain sub-populations of particles scatter at a much larger (or smaller) rate depending on their velocity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Our findings are essential for understanding low-collisionality astrophysical plasmas including the solar wind, the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters and black-hole accretion flows. We show that all three of these plasmas are in the Alfv\'en-enabling regime of firehose saturation and discuss the implications of this result.

Abstract: To lessen the quick depletion of fossil fuels and the resulting environmental harm, it is necessary to investigate effective and eco-friendly materials that can convert lost energy into electricity. The structural, optical, electronic, thermo-electric, and thermodynamic properties of the novel half-Heusler (HH) material NaVTe were examined in the current work using density functional theory (DFT). The Birch-Murnaghan equations of states were used to confirm the structural stability of the NaVTe HH alloy under investigation. These equations show that the compound in question has structural stability because its ground-state energy levels are negative. For spin-down configurations, NaVTe possesses an energy band gap of 3.2 eV, according to band structure and total density of state analysis. NaVTe is a material that is desirable for optoelectronic applications due to its optical features, which include maximum conductivity and absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The figure of merit and other thermodynamic and thermoelectric parameters are calculated. According to these predicted outcomes, the NaVTe HH alloy would be the ideal option for thermo-electric and renewable energy applications.

Abstract: This study presents a finite difference method (FDM) to model the electromagnetic field propagation in eccentric coaxial waveguides filled with lossy uniaxially anisotropic media. The formulation utilizes conformal transformation to map the eccentric circular waveguide into an equivalent concentric one. In the concentric problem, we introduce a novel normalized Helmholtz equation to decouple TM and TE modes, and we solve this non-homogeneous partial differential equation using the finite difference in cylindrical coordinates. The proposed approach was validated against perturbation-based, spectral element-based, and finite-integration-based numerical solutions. The preliminary results show that our solution is superior in computational time. Furthermore, our FDM formulation can be extended with minimal adaptations to model complex media problems, such as metamaterial devices, optical fibers, and geophysical exploration sensors.

Abstract: This study comprehensively investigates fast ion-driven drift instability, extending the theory in [B. J. Kang and T. S. Hahm, Phys. Plasmas 26, 042501 (2019)]. The eigenmode equation, including the resonant contribution of passing fast ions, is derived and solved using the shooting method. Passing fast ions significantly affect the instability in weak negative shear or moderate positive shear plasmas. Eigenstate transitions to non-ground states occur more readily in weak magnetic shear, high safety factor, and long wavelength perturbations. Linear gyrokinetic simulations using the GKV code verify the theory, showing good agreement with shooting method results. The estimated quasilinear transport indicates that the net energy flux can be inward, without contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. These findings have important implications for heating efficiency and plasma confinement in the heating process, such as Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) in future fusion devices.

Abstract: The accuracy of high precision and fundamental measurements of atomic transition frequencies via laser spectroscopy depends upon fitting the spectral data with a lineshape. With atomic hydrogen and antihydrogen 1S-2S two-photon spectroscopy, computer intensive Monte-Carlo simulations have been used to compute the optical Bloch equations in order to match and interpret the experimental spectra. For the highest resolutions, one tries to minimize saturation effects going to regimes of low excitation probability, where perturbation theory can provide reliable results. Here we describe an analytical approach to the lineshape based on perturbation theory accounting for the AC-Stark shift and ionization. The expressions can be used for beam experiments or integrated over the magnetic field profile for a trapped sample. Theses lineshapes, providing fast results, allow for studies of many systematic effects that influence the accuracy of the determination of the central frequency. This development has relevance to hydrogen beam experiments and to trapped hydrogen and antihydrogen, as developed by the ALPHA collaboration at CERN, for tests of the CPT-symmetry and the highest accuracy measurement on antimatter.

Abstract: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a powerful technique for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. However, SMS reconstruction remains challenging due to complex signal interactions between and within the excited slices. In this study, we introduce ROGER, a robust SMS MRI reconstruction method based on deep generative priors. Utilizing denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), ROGER begins with Gaussian noise and gradually recovers individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while enforcing data consistency from measured k-space data within the readout concatenation framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM training can be performed on single-slice images without requiring modifications for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method incorporates a low-frequency enhancement (LFE) module to address the practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo (FSE) and echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed fully-sampled autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments on both retrospectively and prospectively accelerated datasets demonstrate that ROGER consistently outperforms existing methods, enhancing both anatomical and functional imaging with strong out-of-distribution generalization. The source code and sample data for ROGER are available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/ROGER.

**Authors:** Alexander, Yakimov

Transition-metal hydrides (TMHs) find numerous applications across fields, from catalysis to H2 storage. Yet, determining the structure of TMHs can remain a challenge, as hydrogen is difficult to detect by X-ray based or classical spectroscopic techniques. Considering that deuterium isotope (D) is a quadrupolar nucleus (I = 1) and that a quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) depends on the distance between D and its bonding partner E (dED), we evaluate this trend across molecularly-defined transition-metal deuterides (TMDs) through a systematic investigation across TM block elements using both computations and experiments. We show that the M–D bond distance (dMD) in [Å] correlates with the CQ values in [kHz] as dMD = 7.83(CQ + 28.7)-1/3 - independently from the nature of the TM - with an accuracy > 0.04-0.08 Å. Based on experimental CQ values measured by 2H solid-state NMR, this simple correlation is then used to obtain the M-D bond distances in two silica-supported TMDs (M = Zr and Ir), notable heterogeneous catalysts, representing early and late TMDs, where evaluating M-D bond distances by other means is very challenging. Considering the ease of measurement, this method is readily applicable to a large range of diamagnetic terminal M–Ds, from molecular to surface sites, making 2H NMR a method of choice to measure TMDs bond distances.

**Authors:** Helen, Grüninger

Sodium-based solid-state batteries may represent safe and cost-effective energy storage devices, complementing Li-ion for specific applications such as grid storage. However, sustainable solid-state electrolytes (SE) with high ionic conductivity need to be developed. Halide solid electrolytes have attracted significant attention, especially for use in catholyte composites, due to their sufficient ionic conductivity, stability in contact with cathodes and adequate mechanical properties. Here we investigate novel SE based on NaAlCl4 and Na2ZnCl4, nominally Na1+xZnxAl1-xCl4. Compounds synthesized by ball milling and investigated by XRD revealed a two-phase system, with however a solid solution in the Na2ZnCl4-type structure extending to 30% Al substitution. EIS results demonstrate that the ionic conductivity is optimal near the edge of the miscibility gap (x = 0.69), where  is increased by several orders of magnitude as compared to NZC and reaches 1.5×10⁻5 S/cm (35 MPa, 25 °C), above the values of NaAlCl4. The combined use of molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance distinctly elucidate the importance of achieving enough Na⁺ vacancies in both Na sublattices in NZC-type structures. This work introduces a novel class of SE based on the NZC structure and provides clear insights into the correlation between composition, crystalline structure, and ionic conduction pathways.

**Authors:** SANJIT, KONAR

Spin crossover (SCO) in metal-organic cages (MOCs) remains underexplored despite their potential for fascinating applications in molecular switches and sensors. The interplay between the structural flexibility of MOCs and spin state switching offers a promising avenue for tuning magnetic properties in a controlled environment. Herein, we report how varying diastereomeric ratios, influenced by magnetically inequivalent protons, alter ligand field strength and result in distinct SCO profiles. Three FeII4L6 tetrahedral MOCs were synthesized via subcomponent self-assembly of benzidine, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde, and FeX2 salt (MOCs 1–3) having anions tetrafluoroborate, perchlorate, and triflimide, respectively. Different binding motifs of the syn and anti-conformations of the diimine ligands coupled with the anion templation render a combination of different diastereomers of the MOCs, altering the structural and magnetic properties of the resulting assemblies. MOCs 1 and 2 exhibited identical and gradual SCO behaviour, whereas MOC 3 exhibited SCO above room temperature in the solid state. Variable temperature 1H NMR and UV-Visible spectroscopy predicted the spin transition (ST) temperature to be in the order: T½ (1) < T½ (2) < T½ (3), deciphering the ligand field strength and emphasizing the role of ligand conformation and anion templation on SCO behaviour.

# Coupling of Geodesic Acoustic Modes and Resonant Magnetic Perturbations in Fusion Plasmas

## 聚变等离子体中测地声学模式与共振磁扰动的耦合

An analysis of the statistical spectral characteristics of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs), geodesic acoustic modes (GAMs), and their nonlinear coupling with ambient turbulence in the edge region of the HL-2A tokamak has been performed. Experimental observations reveal that RMPs significantly affect low-frequency fluctuations and large-scale turbulence. We present the first direct evidence that increasing RMP current weakens the coupling between GAMs and other frequency modes. Specifically, the amplitude of GAMs decreases as the RMP current increases, with larger RMP currents leading to a more pronounced suppression of GAMs. Moreover, the radial correlation length of turbulence is found to strongly correlate with the increase in RMP current and the reduction of zonal flows. Advanced causal analysis further demonstrates that the radial magnetic field (Br) and poloidal flows (Ẽr) exhibit a distinct modulation at a frequency consistent with GAMs, with a phase shift of &pi;, which is modulated by RMP perturbations. These results provide new insights into the impact of RMPs on edge transport, highlighting the dominant role of the interaction between RMP-induced magnetic perturbations, GAMs, and ambient microturbulence in governing edge plasma behavior.

# Structural Basis for the Assembly of Amyloid Fibrils by the Master Cell-Signaling Regulator Human Receptor-Interacting Protein Kinase 1

## 主要细胞信号调节因子人类受体相互作用蛋白激酶1组装淀粉样蛋白纤维的结构基础

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5820237/latest

Amyloid fibrils, typically associated with neurodegenerative diseases, also play critical roles as functional assemblies in biological processes. The RIP homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs) in receptor-interacting protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3) are essential for necroptosis, orchestrating the formation of amyloid-like fibrils that assemble into necrosomes. These supramolecular complexes propagate cell death signals and activate effectors like MLKL. While the structures of human RIPK3 (hRIPK3) homomeric fibrils and RIPK1-RIPK3 heteromeric fibrils have been resolved, the atomic structure of human RIPK1 (hRIPK1) homomeric fibrils has remained elusive.
 
Here, we present a high-resolution structure of hRIPK1 RHIM-mediated amyloid fibrils, determined using an integrative approach combining cryoprobe-detected solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. The fibrils adopt an N-shaped amyloid fold consisting of three &beta;-sheets stabilized by the conserved IQIG RHIM motif through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. A key hydrogen bond between N545 and G542 closes the &beta;2-&beta;3 loop, resulting in denser side-chain packing compared to hRIPK3 homomeric fibrils. This structural feature likely contributes to the compact architecture of hRIPK1 fibrils, in contrast to the more relaxed S-shaped fold observed in hRIPK3.
 
These findings provide structural insights into how hRIPK1 homomeric fibrils nucleate hRIPK3 recruitment and fibrillization during necroptosis, offering broader perspectives on the molecular principles governing RHIM-mediated amyloid assembly and functional amyloids.

Relaxor ferroelectric ceramics have emerged as promising candidates for electrocaloric cooling systems due to their relatively higher heating and cooling capacities. However, simultaneously achieving high temperature changes (&Delta;T) and a wide operating temperature range remains a significant challenge, limiting their practical applications. This work proposes a synergistic strategy that involves precise compositional tuning of the BaTiO₃-xKNbO₃ system to customize the rhombohedral-to-cubic phase boundary around room temperature, coupled with engineering grain orientation of the ceramics. Based on this approach, a maximum &Delta;T of 3.9 K was achieved in c-texture BaTiO₃-KNbO₃ ceramics, outperforming most environmentally friendly ceramics. Notably, the &Delta;T variation remained within &plusmn;10% across a temperature range of 30oC to 80oC, demonstrating a promising material for the design and application of electrocaloric cooling devices. This work provides new insights for the design of ceramics with optimized electrocaloric properties, offering significant potential for improving the efficiency and functionality of next-generation cooling technologies and devices.

## 具有固态自旋集合的高分辨率，宽频范围磁光谱

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5673375/latest

Quantum systems composed of solid-state electronic spins can be sensitive detectors of narrowband magnetic fields. A prominent example is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which has been employed for magnetic spectroscopy with high spatial and spectral resolution. However, NV-diamond spectroscopy protocols are typically based on dynamical decoupling sequences, which are limited to low-frequency signals (≲ 20 MHz) due to the technical requirements on microwave (MW) pulses used to manipulate NV electronic spins. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a high-resolution magnetic spectroscopy protocol that integrates a quantum frequency mixing (QFM) effect in a dense NV ensemble with coherently averaged synchronized readout (CASR) to provide both a wide range of signal frequency detection and sub-Hz spectral resolution. We assess the sensitivity of this QFM-CASR protocol across a frequency range of 10 MHz to 4 GHz. By measuring the spectra of multi-frequency signals near 0.6, 2.4 and 4 GHz, we demonstrate sub-Hz spectral resolution with a nT-scale noise floor for the target signal, and precise phase measurement with error
