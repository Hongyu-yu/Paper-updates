Abstract: A macroscopic square artificial spin ice, or macro-ASI, is a collection of bar magnets placed in a square lattice arrangement. Each magnet is supported by hinges that allow their mechanical rotation. Previous investigations in these structures have shown ground-state configurations and driven dynamics similar to those of their nanosized counterparts. Here, we numerically investigate the impact of a defect, a Dirac string, on the driven dynamics. We find that waves quickly lose coherence by scattering between modes in this system. In addition, we observe a distinct mode associated with the isolated oscillation of the Dirac string. As expected from spatial localization, this resonant mode is under the band of propagating waves in the macro-ASI. The results are analogous to the development of low-frequency edge modes in nanoscopic spin ices in the presence of defects. Our results provide valuable insight into the physics of mechano-magnetic systems, demonstrating the existence of wave scattering and spatial confinement phenomena in macro-ASIs.

Abstract: Recent findings in orbitronics pointed out large current-induced torques originating, in the current understanding, from incident orbital currents. These are generated by orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect (OREE) produced at the interface between some light metal and oxides films e.g. by naturally oxidized copper layer (Cu*). In the present work, by using second harmonic Hall techniques, we determine the ratio of orbital vs spin currents exerting torques on thin transition metals Co ferromagnet in systems using an orbit-to-spin Pt converter as interlayer with Cu*. Our results quantifying damping like torques show that both orbital and spin currents are enhanced in these systems. Moreover, the experimental determination of the decoherence length in a sample series with varying Co thickness clearly demonstrates the interfacial generation of the orbital currents in Cu* by Orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects (REE) leading to subsequent magnetic torque in Co over a typical lengthscale of several nanometers

**Authors:** Naoya Ohta, Joji Nasu

arXiv:2501.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic fields on excitonic condensation in the extended Falicov-Kimball model, which is a spinless two-orbital Hubbard model with orbital splitting. In lattice systems under magnetic fields up to several tens of teslas, Zeeman effects on electron spins have been extensively studied, while the impact on orbital motion has often been considered negligible. However, the recent capability to generate ultra-high magnetic fields exceeding 1000 T has renewed interest in understanding their influence on ordered phases in correlated electron systems, beyond spin-related phenomena. To examine these effects, we incorporate a magnetic field into the extended Falicov-Kimball model by introducing the Peierls phase into the transfer integrals, enabling the study of orbital motion. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we reveal a nonmonotonic response of the excitonic order parameter to increasing magnetic fields. At sufficiently high fields, the excitonic order is suppressed, resulting in a disordered insulating state characterized by partial occupation of the two orbitals with nonzero Chern numbers. This state is distinct from a fully orbital-polarized configuration. Furthermore, our analysis of an excitonic supersolid phase, in which excitonic and orbital orders coexist, demonstrates that orbital order remains robust under magnetic fields, while excitonic condensation is suppressed. These findings provide insights into the interplay between orbital motion and magnetic fields in multi-orbital correlated electron systems.

Abstract: This study reports the observation of the large anomalous Nernst effect in polycrystalline ferromagnetic Co$_{2}$MnGa (CMG) slabs prepared by a spark plasma sintering method. By optimizing the sintering conditions, the anomalous Nernst coefficient reaches ~7.5 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, comparable to the highest value reported in the single-crystalline CMG slabs. Owing to the sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity, the dimensionless figure of merit in our optimized CMG slab shows the record-high value of ~8$\times$10$^{-4}$ at room temperature. With the aid of the nano/microstructure characterization and first-principles phonon calculation, this study discusses the dependence of the transport properties on the degree of crystalline ordering and morphology of crystal-domain boundaries in the sintered CMG slabs. The results reveal a potential of polycrystalline topological materials for transverse thermoelectric applications, enabling the construction of large-scale modules.

Abstract: In this paper, we report the temperature-field phase diagram as well as present a comprehensive study of the electronic structure and three-dimensional fermiology of the triangular-lattice magnet EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, utilizing quantum oscillation measurements, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The complex magnetic phase diagram of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ highlights many transitions through nontrivial AFM states. Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations were observed in the polarized ferromagnetic state of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, revealing three pairs of distinct spin-split frequency branches with small effective masses. A comparison of the angle-dependent oscillation data with first-principles calculations in the ferromagnetic state and angle-resolved photoemission spectra shows good agreement, identifying tubular hole pockets and hourglass-shaped hole pockets at the Brillouin zone center, as well as diamond-shaped electron pockets at the zone boundary. As the temperature increases, the frequency branches of the tiny hourglass pockets evolve into a more cylindrical shape, while the larger pockets remain unchanged. This highlights that variations in exchange splitting, driven by changes in the magnetic moment, primarily impact the small Fermi pockets without significantly altering the overall band structure. This is consistent with first-principles calculations, which show minimal changes near the Fermi level across ferromagnetic and simple antiferromagnetic states or under varying on-site Coulomb repulsion.

Abstract: The emergence of new physical properties at the interfaces between complex oxides has always been of both fundamental and practical importance. Here, we report the observation of a giant topological Hall resistivity of $\sim 2.8 \mu \Omega$ \text{cm} at room temperature in an epitaxial thin-film heterostructure of permalloy (Py, Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) and the half-metallic ferromagnet La$_{0.65}$Sr$_{0.35}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO). This large magnitude of the topological Hall effect in the Py/LSMO heterostructure, compared to a single-layer Py thin film, is attributed to the optimized combination of ferromagnetism in LSMO and the strong spin-orbit-coupling-driven Rashba interaction at the interface. The introduction of a ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) sandwich layer in the Py/LSMO heterostructure also leads to an enhanced topological Hall resistivity compared to the single-layer Py thin film. Interestingly, magnetic force microscopy measurements reveal skyrmion-like features, suggesting the origin of the topological Hall effect. Our theoretical model calculations for the skyrmion lattice further indicate that the Rashba interaction, driven by the broken inversion symmetry in the Py/LSMO films, can account for the observed changes in the topological Hall effect at the interface. Our work opens the door for the potential use of Py/LSMO thin films in spintronic applications.

Abstract: Following the successful experimental realization of the long-sought Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$, enhancing the work temperature of QAH effect has emerged as a significant and challenging task in condensed matter physics. In this work, we demonstrate monolayer TbCl as a promising candidate to realize the room temperature QAH effect. Based on density functional theory + HSE hybrid functional, we identify the topological properties with Hall conductivity $G = -e^2/h$ per layer in three-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator TbCl, which is weakly staked by the QAH layers. The monolayer TbCl inherits the magnetic and topological properties, and exhibits the QAH effect corresponding to the Chern number $C=-1$. The topological band gap is significantly large and reaches 42.8 meV, which is beyond room temperatue. Meanwhile, the magnetic study finds that the extended $5d$ electrons contribute to the magnetic momentum of Tb and lead to sizable exchange and superexchange interactions, resulting in a high Curie temperature $T_c \sim 457$K. All these features demonstrate that monolayer TbCl will provide an ideal platform to realize the room temperature QAH effect.

Abstract: We evaluate the Hall coefficient characterising magnetotransport in an intercalated graphite CaC$_6$ with the Fermi surface reconstructed by an uniaxial charge density wave from closed pockets to open sheets. As the typical order parameter, corresponding to the pseudo-gap in electronic spectrum and consequently to spacing between electron trajectories in reciprocal space, is of the order of $10^2$K, magnetic breakdown in strong experimentally achievable fields of the order of 10T is inevitable. The classical expressions for the components of the magnetoconductivity tensor are strongly modified by magnetic field-assisted over-gap tunneling causing quantum interference. Due to magnetic breakdown, all magnetoconductivity components undergo strong quantum oscillations reflected in the Hall coefficient. In their nature, these are different than standard Shubnikov de Haas oscillations which would not appear in a system with an open Fermi surface.

Abstract: Self-intercalated van der Waals magnets, characterized by self-intercalating native atoms into van der Waals layered structures with intrinsic magnetism, exhibit a variety of novel physical properties. Here, using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we report a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, which has a high Curie temperature of 492 K. We find that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is nearly half-metallic with a spin polarization reaching up to 90.9%. Due to the ferromagnetism and strong spin-orbit coupling effect in Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 138 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ and 305 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ can be realized when its magnetization is along its magnetic easy axis and hard axis, respectively. By doping electrons (holes) into Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, these anomalous Hall conductivities can be increased up to 318 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ (648 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$). Interestingly, a 5-layer Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ thin film retains the room-temperature ferromagnetism with a higher spin polarization and larger anomalous Hall conductivity. Our work demonstrates that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is a novel room-temperature self-intercalated ferromagnet with high spin polarization and large anomalous Hall conductivity, offering great opportunities for designing nano-scale electronic devices.

**Authors:** Miquel Royo, Massimiliano Stengel

arXiv:2501.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear magnets are notoriously difficult to describe within first-principles approaches based on density-functional theory (DFT) because of the presence of low-lying spin excitations. At the level of ground-state calculations, several methods exist to constrain the magnetic moments to a predetermined configuration, and thereby accelerate convergence towards self-consistency. Their use in a perturbative context, however, remains very limited. Here we present a general methodological framework to achieve parametric control over the local spin moments at the linear-response level. Our strategy builds on the concept of Legendre transform to switch between various flavors of magnetic functionals, and to relate their second derivatives via simple linear-algebra operations. Thereby, we can address an arbitrary response function at the time-dependent DFT level of theory with optimal accuracy and minimal computational effort. In the low frequency limit, we identify the leading correction to the existing adiabatic formulation of the problem [S. Ren \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. X {\bf 14}, 011041 (2024)], consisting in a renormalization of the phonon and magnon masses due to electron inertia. As a demonstration, we apply our methodology to the study of the THz optical response in bulk CrI$_3$, where we identify a hybrid electromagnon with mixed spin-lattice character.

# Absence of orbital current torque in Ta/ferromagnet bilayers

**Authors:** Qianbiao Liu, Lijun Zhu

arXiv:2501.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has become a heated debate as to whether the orbital Hall effect of a material could generate a non-local orbital current and a non-zero spin-orbit torque on an adjacent magnetic layer. Here, we report unambiguous evidence that, regardless of the ferromagnets (FMs) (e.g., Ni, Ni81Fe19, Fe, Fe60Co20B20, and FePt), the spin-orbit torque generated by an adjacent Ta, which is predicted to have a 50 times greater positive orbital Hall conductivity than the negative spin Hall conductivity, has essentially the same, negative efficiency, in agreement with the spin Hall effect of Ta being the only source of the interfacial torque. We identify that the constant, positive estimate of the torque of the Ta/FM samples from spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) analysis in a specific FM thickness range (>2 nm for Ni), that was heavily cited in the literature to signify an orbital current torque but strongly disagrees with the fairly long relaxation length in other orbital current torque claims, results from the overlook of a significant thick-dependent self-induced ST-FMR signal of the FM. These results indicate the absence of orbital current torque in Ta/ferromagnet systems, regardless of the type, the SOC strength, and the layer thickness of the ferromagnets.

**Authors:** Haowei Xu, Ju Li

arXiv:2501.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in achieving on-demand control of magnetism through electrical and optical means. In this work, we provide first-principles predictions for the linear and nonlinear Edelstein effects (LEE and NLEE) in the chiral topological semimetal CoSi. The LEE and NLEE represent first- and second-order magnetic responses to external electric fields, enabling precise manipulation of magnetization via electrical and optical methods. We demonstrate that although both LEE and NLEE require time-reversal symmetry breaking, they can still be realized in non-magnetic materials, as time-reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken by heat and dissipation, according to the second law of thermodynamics. Meanwhile, due to different inversion symmetry selection rules, the LEE and NLEE manifest opposite and identical signs in the two enantiomers of CoSi, respectively. We further quantify the magnitude of LEE and NLEE, showing that electrically or optically induced magnetization can reach 10 Bohr magneton per unit cell when the external electric field strength is comparable with the internal atomic electric field, which is on the order of 1 V/A. Our work offers a systematical approach for predicting the electrical and optical control of magnetism in real materials, paving the way for potential applications in areas such as spintronics and magnetic memories.

arXiv:2501.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model is believed to capture the essential physics of cuprate superconductors. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that it fails to reproduce a robust and homogeneous superconducting ground state. Here, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that magnetic excitations in the prototypical cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ are inconsistent with those of a simple Hubbard model. The magnetic response of hole carriers, contributing to an emergent branch of spin excitations, is strongly suppressed. This effect is the consequence of d-wave-like pairing, enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude through a large nearest-neighbor attractive interaction. The similarity between cuprate ladders and the two-dimensional compounds suggests that such an enhanced hole pairing may be a universal feature of superconducting cuprates.

Abstract: We investigate the spin dynamics of the cuprate ladder Sr$_{2.5}$Ca$_{11.5}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ to elucidate the behavior of its intrinsically doped holes. Combining high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and density matrix renormalization group calculations enables a comprehensive analysis of the collective magnetic dynamics. We find a general absence of magnetic signatures from unpaired charges, indicating holes within the system form strongly bound localized Cooper pairs. A one-band Hubbard model fails to match the spectral features but a straightforward extension to a large attractive nearest-neighbor interaction quantitatively explains our results. Our finding shows the significance of additional interactions beyond the long-predicted quantum spin pairing in the ($d$-wave) charge pairing process. Considering the parallels between ladders and two-dimensional cuprates, these results are potentially relevant for square lattices as well.

Abstract: We report on the properties of SrTb2O4, a frustrated zigzag ladder antiferromagnet, studied by single crystal neutron diffraction (with polarised neutrons in zero field and unpolarised neutrons in an applied magnetic field), as well as by neutron spectroscopy on a polycrystalline sample. The neutron scattering results are supported by single crystal magnetisation and heat capacity measurements. In zero field, neutron diffraction data show no transition to a magnetically ordered state down to the lowest experimentally available temperature of 35 mK, and the material remains magnetically disordered down to this temperature. Polarised neutron diffraction measurements reveal the presence of a diffuse scattering signal suggesting only very weak spin-spin correlations in the ground state. For H // c (the easy magnetisation direction), we followed the magnetisation process using neutron diffraction measurements and observed the appearance of field-induced magnetic Bragg peaks with integer h and k indices in the (hk0) scattering plane. No magnetic peaks with a non-zero propagation vector were detected. The observed in-field data fit well to a simple two-sublattice model with magnetic moments aligned along the field direction but being significantly different in magnitude for the two inequivalent Tb3+ sites in the unit cell. Overall, the collected data point to a nonmagnetic ground state in SrTb2O4 despite the presence of strong interactions.

Abstract: By combining ab initio downfolding with cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we study the degree of correlations in the low-temperature structures of the breathing-mode kagome van der Waals materials Nb$_3$(F,Cl,Br,I)$_8$. We show that the Coulomb correlation strength steadily increases from I to Br, Cl, and F, allowing us to identify Nb$_3$I$_8$ as a weakly correlated (obstructed atomic) insulator whose gap is only mildly affected by the local Coulomb interaction. Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ are strongly correlated insulators, whose gaps are significantly influenced by Coulomb-induced vertex corrections. Nb$_3$F$_8$ is a prototypical bulk Mott-insulator whose gap is initially opened by strong correlation effects. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements comparing Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$I$_8$ allow us to experimentally confirm these findings by revealing spectroscopic footprints of the degree of correlation. Our calculations further predict that the entire material family can be tuned into correlated charge-transfer or Mott-insulating phases upon electron or hole doping. Our magnetic property analysis additionally shows that inter-layer magnetic frustrations in the high-temperature phase drive the lattice phase transition to the low-temperature structures. The accompanying bilayer hybridization through inter-layer dimerization yields magnetic singlet ground states in the Cl, Br, and I compounds. Our findings establish Nb$_3$X$_8$ as a robust, versatile, and tunable class for van der Waals-based Coulomb and Mott engineering and allow us to speculate on the symmetry-breaking effects necessary for the recently observed Josephson diode effect in NbSe$_2$/Nb$_3$Br$_8$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures.

Abstract: In this work we provide a comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental studies of the properties of polarons formed by mobile impurities strongly interacting with quantum many-body systems. We present a unified perspective on the universal concepts and theoretical techniques used to characterize polarons in two distinct platforms, ultracold atomic gases and atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides, which are linked by many deep parallels. We review polarons in both fermionic and bosonic environments, highlighting their similarities and differences including the intricate interplay between few- and many-body physics. Various kinds of polarons with long-range interactions or in magnetic backgrounds are discussed, and the theoretical and experimental progress towards understanding interactions between polarons is described. We outline how polaron physics, regarded as the low density limit of quantum mixtures, provides fundamental insights regarding the phase diagram of complex condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we describe how polarons may serve as quantum sensors of many-body physics in complex environments. Our work highlights the open problems, identifies new research directions and provides a comprehensive framework for this rapidly evolving research field.

Abstract: We propose a method to compute expectation values in 1+1-dimensional massive Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) with line defects using Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product State (RCMPS). Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.

Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) scattering by non-symmetric wavelength-scale particles on a planar surface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies, both in planetary and geo-sciences. We conduct numerical simulations of EM scattering by rough polyhedral particles (with 12 or 20 faces) using the discrete-dipole approximation and contrast the results to that of spheres. The particles have permittivities corresponding to common minerals in the microwave regime ($\epsilon_r=4.7 + 0.016$i and $7.8 + 0.09$i), and a size-frequency distribution (SFD) consistent with the observed scattering properties (power law distribution of size parameters between 0.5 and 8 with an index from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$). The assumed substrate permittivity $2.4 + 0.012$i corresponds to a powdered regolith. We present what roles the particle roundness, permittivity, and SFD for a realistic range of parameters play in the EM scattering properties as a function of incidence angle with a focus on backscattering in microwave-remote-sensing applications. The particle roundness and SFD have a clearly observable effect on the polarimetric properties, while the role of permittivity is relatively minor (in the studied range). Among various backscattering observables, the circular polarization ratio is the least sensitive to the decrease of the upper boundary (down to a size parameter of 3) and the index of the SFD.

Abstract: Pauli spin blockade (PSB) is a spin-dependent charge transport process that typically appears in double quantum dot (QD) devices and is employed in fundamental research on single spins in nanostructures to read out semiconductor qubits. The operating temperature of PSB is limited by that of the QDs and remains below 10 K, limiting wide application development. Herein, we confirm that a single deep dopant in the channel of a silicon field effect transistor functions as a room-temperature QD; consequently, transport through two different deep dopants exhibits PSB up to room temperature. The characteristic magnetoconductance provides a means to identify PSB and enables the PSB device to function as a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity below geomagnetic field. Lifting in PSB caused by magnetic resonance (50 K) and Rabi oscillations (10 K) are also observed. Further development of this unique system may lead to room-temperature quantum technologies based on silicon technology.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological features in the charge excitations of Mott insulators in the Chern-Hubbard model. In the strong correlation regime, treating electrons as the sum of holons and doublons excitations, we compute the topological phase diagram of Mott insulators at half-filling using composite operator formalism. The Green function zeros manifest as the tightly bound pairs of such elementary excitations of the Mott insulators. Our analysis examines the winding number associated with the occupied Hubbard bands and the band of Green's function zeros. We show that both the poles and zeros show gapless states and zeros, respectively, in line with bulk-boundary correspondence. The gapless edge states emerge in a junction geometry connecting a topological Mott band insulator and a topological Mott zeros phase. These include an edge electronic state that carries a charge and a charge-neutral gapless zero mode. Our study is relevant to several twisted materials with flat bands where interactions play a dominant role.

Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.

Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.

Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 114 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi level, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring the large AHE in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.

Abstract: Exploring and manipulating the orbital degrees of freedom in solids has become a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. Here, we demonstrate that spin waves can provide a way to control electronic orbital magnetism by the mechanism of scalar spin chirality, allowing for experimental detection using techniques such as the magneto-optical Kerr effect and scanning transmission electron microscopy. By applying linear spin wave theory, we uncover that electronic magnon-driven orbital magnetization is extremely sensitive to the character of the magnonic excitations. Furthermore, we show that both the induced electronic orbital magnetism and the Nernst transport properties of the orbital angular momentum can be regulated by the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Kitaev interaction, as well as the direction and magnitude of the external magnetic field. We argue that magnon-mediated electronic orbital magnetism presents an emergent variable which has to be taken into account when considering the physics of coupling magnonic excitiations to phonons and light.

Abstract: Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are a diverse group of microorganisms whose movement can be directed via a magnetic field, which makes them attractive for applications in medicine and microfluidics. One of their key properties is the magnetic moment $m$, which is challenging to measure experimentally. We perform optical imaging experiments with MSR-1 MTB, and derive both the $m$ statistics and the scaling of $m$ with the MTB size using an explicit and fully automated method to determine $m$ from the MTB trajectories via the U-turn protocol, which measures $m$ based on the U-shaped trajectories exhibited by the MTB in an applied alternating magnetic field. The proposed method is an alternative to the standard U-turn time-based moment calculation and uses the theoretical U-turn shape function we have derived. This directly accounts for the U-turn geometry and determines the moment from the U-turn branch width. We couple this approach with a robust U-turn decomposition algorithm that detects U-turns from MTB tracks regardless of their orientations. We report a linear dependence of $m$ on the size of the bacteria, accounting for the bacteria velocity variations during the U-turns. We also demonstrate that the new U-turn shape-based and the conventional time-based methods produce significantly different results. The proposed method can be used to differentiate between various types of MTB within the same population based on their velocity and magnetic moments, and to precisely characterize the magnetic properties of a culture.

Abstract: We report the determination of the Land\'{e} $g_J$ factor and Zeeman coefficients for the ground-state of $^{171}$Yb$^+$, relevant to microwave quantum frequency standards (QFSs). The $g_J$ factor is obtained by using two independent methods: multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and multireference configuration interaction, yielding a consistent value of 2.002615(70). The first- and second-order Zeeman coefficients are determined as 14,010.78(49) Hz/$\mu$T and 31.0869(22) mHz/$\mu$T$^2$, respectively, based on the calculated $g_J$ factor. These coefficients enable reduced magnetic-field-induced uncertainties, improving the accuracy of the $^{171}$Yb$^+$ microwave QFSs. The results reported in this work also offer potential for improved constraints on variations in fundamental constants through frequency comparisons, and advancing trapped-ion quantum computers based on the ground-state hyperfine splitting of $^{171}$Yb$^+$.

Abstract: A major achievement of Dewar and coworkers is the SPEC code to construct stepped-pressure equilibria in magnetohydrostatics without axisymmetry. Their existence had been proved by Bruno and Laurence. As part of the procedure of Bruno and Laurence, it is required to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a magnetic potential on the outside of an interface given the field on the inside and the pressure-jump across the interface. For non-axisymmetric interface, it was understood that solutions with insufficiently irrational rotational transform might not exist, and examples have been given for which there are no solutions at all for large enough pressure-jump. The present paper gives a method to compute regions in the phase space for the pressure-jump Hamiltonian through which no invariant tori pass. The paper also shows how to present the results as regions in the space of pressure-jumps and outer rotational transform for which there is no solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The method is expected to reach arbitrarily close to the full non-existence region with enough computational work, so what is left over can be relied on to be mostly invariant tori. The paper also brings to attention a class of metrics on tori that are not necessarily axisymmetric yet have integrable geodesic flow. They could give interfaces with solutions for all but finitely many rotational transforms.

Abstract: Programmable metasurfaces have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves in real time, leading to the emergence of a prominent area in wireless communication, namely reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), to control the signal propagation and coverage. However, the existing RISs usually suffer from limited operating distance and band interference, which hinder their practical applications in wireless relay and communication systems. To overcome the limitations, we propose an amplifying and filtering RIS (AF-RIS) to enhance the in-band signal energy and filter the out-of-band signal of the incident EM waves, ensuring the miniaturization of the RIS array and enabling its anti-interference ability. In addition, each AF-RIS element is equipped with a 2-bit phase control capability, further endowing the entire array with great beamforming performance. An elaborately designed 4*8 AF-RIS array is presented by integrating the power dividing and combining networks, which substantially reduces the number of amplifiers and filters, thereby reducing the hardware costs and power consumption. Experimental results showcase the powerful capabilities of AF-RIS in beam-steering, frequency selectivity, and signal amplification. Therefore, the proposed AF-RIS holds significant promise for critical applications in wireless relay systems by offering an efficient solution to improve frequency selectivity, enhance signal coverage, and reduce hardware size.

Abstract: This study reports the observation of the large anomalous Nernst effect in polycrystalline ferromagnetic Co$_{2}$MnGa (CMG) slabs prepared by a spark plasma sintering method. By optimizing the sintering conditions, the anomalous Nernst coefficient reaches ~7.5 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, comparable to the highest value reported in the single-crystalline CMG slabs. Owing to the sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity, the dimensionless figure of merit in our optimized CMG slab shows the record-high value of ~8$\times$10$^{-4}$ at room temperature. With the aid of the nano/microstructure characterization and first-principles phonon calculation, this study discusses the dependence of the transport properties on the degree of crystalline ordering and morphology of crystal-domain boundaries in the sintered CMG slabs. The results reveal a potential of polycrystalline topological materials for transverse thermoelectric applications, enabling the construction of large-scale modules.

Abstract: Self-intercalated van der Waals magnets, characterized by self-intercalating native atoms into van der Waals layered structures with intrinsic magnetism, exhibit a variety of novel physical properties. Here, using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we report a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, which has a high Curie temperature of 492 K. We find that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is nearly half-metallic with a spin polarization reaching up to 90.9%. Due to the ferromagnetism and strong spin-orbit coupling effect in Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 138 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ and 305 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ can be realized when its magnetization is along its magnetic easy axis and hard axis, respectively. By doping electrons (holes) into Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, these anomalous Hall conductivities can be increased up to 318 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ (648 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$). Interestingly, a 5-layer Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ thin film retains the room-temperature ferromagnetism with a higher spin polarization and larger anomalous Hall conductivity. Our work demonstrates that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is a novel room-temperature self-intercalated ferromagnet with high spin polarization and large anomalous Hall conductivity, offering great opportunities for designing nano-scale electronic devices.

Abstract: A large number of magnetic sensors, like superconducting quantum interference devices, optical pumping and nitrogen vacancy magnetometers, were shown to satisfy the energy resolution limit. This limit states that the magnetic sensitivity of the sensor, when translated into a product of energy with time, is bounded below by Planck's constant, hbar. This bound implies a fundamental limitation as to what can be achieved in magnetic sensing. Here we explore biological magnetometers, in particular three magnetoreception mechanisms thought to underly animals' geomagnetic field sensing: the radical-pair, the magnetite and the MagR mechanism. We address the question of how close these mechanisms approach the energy resolution limit. At the quantitative level, the utility of the energy resolution limit is that it informs the workings of magnetic sensing in model-independent ways, and thus can provide subtle consistency checks for theoretical models and estimated or measured parameter values, particularly needed in complex biological systems. At the qualitative level, the closer the energy resolution is to hbar, the more "quantum" is the sensor. This offers an alternative route towards understanding the quantum biology of magnetoreception. It also quantifies the room for improvement, illuminating what Nature has achieved, and stimulating the engineering of biomimetic sensors exceeding Nature's magnetic sensing performance.

Abstract: The interaction of fast charged particles with graphene layers can generate electromagnetic modes. This wake effect has been recently proposed for short-wavelength, high-gradient particle acceleration and for obtaining brilliant radiation sources. In this study, the excitation of wakefields produced by a point-like charged particle moving parallel to a multilayer graphene array (which may be supported by an insulated substrate) is studied using the linearized hydrodynamic theory. General expressions for the excited longitudinal and transverse wakefields have been derived. The dependencies of the wakefields on the positions of the layers and the substrate, the velocity and the surface density have been extensively analyzed. This study provides a deeper understanding of the physical phenomena underlying plasmonic excitations in graphene layers, paving the way for potential applications of these structures in particle acceleration, nanotechnology and materials science.

Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} < \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} > 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} > \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.

In this paper we build on previous work to characterise a new phase with stoichiometry Li3(OH)2Br existing between ∼225 degC and ∼275 degC in the LiBr-LiOH phase diagram. Diffraction studies indicate that the phase takes a hexagonal unit cell, and theoretical mod- elingisusedtosuggestapossiblecrystalstructure. Nuclearmagneticresonancespectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements demonstrate excellent lithium- ion dynamics in this phase, with an ionic conductivity of 0.12 S/cm at 250 degC. Initial attempts to stabilise this phase at room temperature through quenching were not successful. 1 Instead, a metastable state demonstrating poor lithium-ion conductivity is found to form. This is an important consideration for the synthesis of Li2OHBr solid-state electrolytes (also found in the LiBr-LiOH phase diagram) which are synthesised by cooling through phase fields containing Li3(OH)2Br, and are hence susceptible to these impurities.

**Authors:** Andrej, Frolov

Metabolomics, which is typically referred to as the post-genomic methodology addressing low molecular weight metabolites, became a powerful tool in post-genomic research over the last two decades. Indeed, the state of the art metabolomics relies on several well-established complemen-tary platforms – nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, liquid and gas chromatog-raphy coupled on-line to mass spectrometry (LC- and GC-MS, respectively), capillary electropho-resis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Among them, GC-MS represents one of the oldest and most well-established techniques currently employed in metabolomics of volatile compounds and non-volatiles – polar low-molecular weight metabolites, which can be efficiently converted in volatile form by comprehensive derivatization of polar functional groups. Currently, GC-MS is recog-nized as the core analytical technique in characterization of plant primary metabolome, although the other methods contribute to the whole metabolite profile essentially. Therefore, here we ad-dress the role of GC-MS in plant metabolomics and its potential for profiling of low molecular weight metabolites. Further, we comprehensively review the methods of sample preparation with a special emphasis on the extraction and derivatization approaches, which are currently employed to improve the method performance and its metabolome coverage.

The Tawenchahanxi mining area is a representative skarn-type deposit located in the Qimantage region, within the western section of the East Kunlun orogenic belt. Following over a decade of continuous development since exploration commenced in 2009, both the mining rights and detailed exploration rights have been submitted.This paper investigates various quality characteristics of the ore, including mineral composition, structural features, chemical composition, and ore types. The aim is to enhance our understanding of the mineralogical characteristics present in this area and to provide a foundation for future geological work.Research findings indicate that the mining area exhibits a rich diversity of ore types, with deposits characterized by multi-genesis processes, multiple stages of formation, and various mineral species. This complexity broadens prospecting opportunities within this region. The ore body contains 30.98% magnetic iron (mFe) content and 15.60% FeO content, resulting in an mFe/TFe ratio of 86%, classifying it as magnetite ore.Additionally, analyses reveal that the ore contains sulfur at 5.30%, arsenic at 0.30%, and MgO at 14.27%. The elevated levels of arsenic, sulfur, and MgO adversely affect the quality of iron concentrate and copper concentrate products. Furthermore, there exists a complex relationship among co-associated elements; thus, it is imperative to strengthen research on comprehensive recovery processes.

In this study, a combining method using dispersive micro solid phase extraction and vortex-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction was presented for the first time as a pioneering methodology capable of concurrently cleaning up and derivatizing/ extracting existing primary aliphatic amines in aqueous solutions after eliminating or decreasing matrix effect posed by skin moisturizers. A magnetic adsorbent (iron oxide modified by mercapto acetic acid, MAA@Fe3O4) has been employed to facilitate the matrix removal. To corroborate the authenticity of the synthesized adsorbent, various identification methods were employed, including X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry analyses. All effective parameters were optimized in passivation of the adsorbent for the analytes and their concurrent derivatization and extraction. A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector was utilized to identify and quantify the derivatives of amines. Eco-friendly characteristics, short extraction duration, high matrix removal efficiency, high unadsorbed percentage of amines by the adsorbent, simplicity, high precision, lack of requirement for specialized equipment, adsorbent reusability up to five cycles, exceptional proficiency in the extraction and derivatization of amines, and a comprehensive or relative superiority in analytical parameters, including extraction recovery, enrichment factor, relative standard deviation, coefficient of determination, limit of quantification and detection, and relative recovery, underscoring the merits and advantages of the proposed method.
