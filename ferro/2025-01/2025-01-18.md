Left and right circularly polarized light, where the electromagnetic waves spiral in a clockwise and counterclockwise manner as they travel, plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications, from enhancing medical imaging techniques to enabling advanced communication technologies. However, generating circularly polarized light often requires complex and bulky optical set-ups, which hinders its use in systems with space constraints.

Abstract: Goldstone modes acquire a frequency gap in the presence of perturbations that break the underlying continuous symmetry. Here, we study the response of a spin-based Goldstone mode to strain and magnetic field in the broken helix, a multi-$\textbf{Q}$ phase of EuIn$_2$As$_2$. Optical polarimetry with spatial and temporal resolution allows us to access information about both the structure and frequency of optically excited spin-wave modes under different strain conditions. We observe nearly uniform spin precession characteristic of a Goldstone mode only when magnetic field dominates over strain. In this regime, the frequency depends linearly on the applied field. A symmetry analysis for predicting the mode frequency near zero field demonstrates that the observed scaling is of the lowest allowed order. This work thus demonstrates the connections between magnetic symmetries and the frequency dependence of the Goldstone mode in an external field, and illustrates the power of our technique for studying the dynamics of complex magnets.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the relationships between film growth conditions, crystalline microstructure, and magnetic properties of epitaxial Yttrium Iron Garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) thin films, deposited on Gallium Gadolinium Garnet (Ga$_3$Gd$_5$O$_{12}$, GGG). A direct correlation was observed between the residual epitaxial strain, bulk magnetic properties like saturation magnetization and magnetic damping), and the performance of spin-wave transmission devices based on these films. This correlation offers a pathway for a simplified, rapid assessment of YIG film quality, avoiding the need for complex time-consuming characterization techniques. In addition, we report a comprehensive investigation into the influence of pulsed-laser deposition parameters, including deposition temperature, pressure, laser fluence, frequency, and annealing conditions. Through systematic deposition optimization, state-of-the-art YIG films exhibiting ultralow magnetic damping could be obtained, which is critical for high-performance spintronic applications.

Abstract: With rapid advances in qubit technologies, techniques for localizing, modulating, and measuring RF fields and their impact on qubit performance are of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that flux-channeling from a permalloy nanowire can be used to achieve localized spatial modulation of an RF field and that the modulated field can be mapped with high resolution using the Rabi oscillations of an NV center. Rabi maps reveal ~100 mm wavelength microwaves concentrated in sub-300 nm-scale regions with up to ~16$\times$ power enhancement. This modulation is robust over a 20 dBm power range and has no adverse impact on NV $T_2$ coherence time. Micromagnetic simulations confirm that the modulated field results from the nanowire's stray field through its constructive/destructive interference with the incident RF field. Our findings provide a new pathway for controlling qubits, amplifying RF signals, and mapping local fields in various on-chip RF technologies.

# Predicting Fundamental Gaps of Chromium-Based 2D Materials Using GW Methods

arXiv:2501.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and accurate predictions of the two-dimensional (2D) material's fundamental gap are crucial for next-generation flexible electronic and photonic devices. We, therefore, evaluated the predictivity of the GW approach in its several variants built on various density functional theory (DFT) inputs. We identified reasons for significant discrepancies between generalized gradient approximation and hybrid DFT results for intricate cases of 2D materials containing chromium and evaluated the diverse behavior of subsequent quasiparticle corrections. We examined the impact of omitted vertex corrections using the more computationally intensive quasiparticle self-consistent QPGW and partially self-consistent QPGW$_0$ methodologies. We observed consistent trends across Cr-based and other 2D materials compared by advanced GW calculations, suggesting that single-shot G$_0$W$_0$@PBE can provide reasonable estimates of fundamental gaps when applied with caution. While this approach shows promise for a variety of 2D materials, including complicated antiferromagnetic chromium-based transition metal carbides (MXenes), further research is required to validate its reliability for strongly correlated systems. In contrast, the G$_0$W$_0$@HSE06 approach may strongly overestimate gaps in some cases.

Abstract: Metallic amorphous ferrimagnets derived from alloying 3d transition metals with 4f electron rare earths host fascinating effects of compensation between the 3d and 4f magnetic sublattices. Here, a detailed study of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), planar Hall effect (PHE) and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) are reported on a series of CoHo thin films over a wide field temperature phase space. Close to magnetic compensation temperature, the AHE loops show a double sign reversal and signatures of spin flop transition at higher fields. The AMR and PHE also display strong deviations from the classical angular dependence seen in soft ferromagnets like permalloy as the angle between in-plane current and magnetic field is scanned from 0 to 360 degrees. It is argued that the non zero orbital angular momentum of Ho ions in the lattice and stabilization of bubble domains below magnetic saturation may be responsible for such features. Direct imaging of magnetic textures with X ray photoelectron microscopy shows formation of stripe domain patterns in the regime of sublattice compensation. Such stripes are likely to transform into magnetic bubbles before full saturation is reached in a large magnetic field.

Abstract: Symmetry elegantly governs the fundamental properties and derived functionalities of condensed matter. For instance, realizing the superconducting diode effect (SDE) demands breaking space-inversion and time-reversal symmetries simultaneously. Although the SDE is widely observed in various platforms, its underlying mechanism remains debated, particularly regarding the role of vortices. Here, we systematically investigate the nonreciprocal transport in the chiral type-I superconductor NbGe2. Moreover, we induce type-II superconductivity with elevated superconducting critical temperature on the artificial surface by focused ion beam irradiation, enabling control over vortex dynamics in NbGe2 devices. Strikingly, we observe negligible diode efficiency (Q < 2%) at low magnetic fields, which rises significantly to Q ~ 50% at high magnetic fields, coinciding with an abrupt increase in vortex creep rate when the superconductivity of NbGe2 bulk is suppressed. These results unambiguously highlight the critical role of vortex dynamics in the SDE, in addition to the established symmetry rules.

Abstract: Spin-flip dark excitons are optical-dipole-forbidden quasiparticles with remarkable potential in optoelectronics, especially when they are realized within cleavable van der Waals materials. Despite this potential, dark excitons have not yet been definitively identified in ferromagnetic van der Waals materials. Here, we report two dark excitons in a model ferromagnetic material CrI3 using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and show that they feature narrower linewidths compared to the bright excitons previously reported in this material. These excitons are shown to have spin-flip character, to disperse as a function of momentum, and to change through the ferromagnetic transition temperature. Given the versatility of van der Waals materials, these excitons hold promise for new types of magneto-optical functionality.

arXiv:2501.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can isotropic Magneto-Active Elastomers (MAEs) undergo giant magnetically induced deformations and exhibit huge magnetorheological effects simultaneously? In this experimental and theoretical study, we reveal how the macroscopic deformation of MAEs relates to the process of particle restructuring caused by application of a magnetic field. For this purpose, MAE cylinders with different aspect ratios and particle loadings are studied in uniform magnetic fields. The axial deformations of the cylinders are acquired using an optical camera. A unified mean-field model proposed in previous studies is adapted to describe the transition of initially isotropic cylinders into transversely isotropic ones. This mechanical transition is caused by the rearrangement of particles into dense columnar structures aligned with the field and is believed to result in a huge magnetorheological effect. Our model however predicts less than three-fold increase in elastic moduli when evaluated along the field direction. This prediction is based on a careful examination of the shear moduli of studied MAEs and the columnar structures. A weak magnetorheological effect explains significant axial deformations measured in the field direction. A strong magnetorheological effect would hinder axial deformations due to an increase in modulus by several orders of magnitude. Not only are the moduli and macroscopic deformations influenced by microstructure evolution, but so is the magnetization of particles, which increases as they rearrange into dense columns. With this study, we show that the unified mean-field model provides quantitative access to hidden material properties such as magnetization and stiffness in MAE samples with different shapes and evolving microstructures.

arXiv:2501.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring and manipulating the orbital degrees of freedom in solids has become a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. Here, we demonstrate that spin waves can provide a way to control electronic orbital magnetism by the mechanism of scalar spin chirality, allowing for experimental detection using techniques such as the magneto-optical Kerr effect and scanning transmission electron microscopy. By applying linear spin wave theory, we uncover that electronic magnon-driven orbital magnetization is extremely sensitive to the character of the magnonic excitations. Furthermore, we show that both the induced electronic orbital magnetism and the Nernst transport properties of the orbital angular momentum can be regulated by the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Kitaev interaction, as well as the direction and magnitude of the external magnetic field. We argue that magnon-mediated electronic orbital magnetism presents an emergent variable which has to be taken into account when considering the physics of coupling magnonic excitiations to phonons and light.

Abstract: Current-induced torques originating from earth-abundant 3d elements offer a promising avenue for low-cost and sustainable spintronic memory and logic applications. Recently, orbital currents -- transverse orbital angular momentum flow in response to an electric field -- have been in the spotlight since they allow current-induced torque generation from 3d transition metals. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the current-induced spin and orbital torques in Cu-based magnetic heterostructures. We show that high torque efficiencies can be achieved in engineered Ni80Fe20/Cu bilayers where Cu is naturally oxidized, exceeding the ones found in the archetypical Co/Pt. Furthermore, we demonstrate sign and amplitude control of the damping-like torque by manipulating the oxidation state of Cu via solid-state gating. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between charge, spin, and orbital transport in Cu-based heterostructures and open the door to the development of gate-tunable spin-orbitronic devices.

**Authors:** Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda

arXiv:2501.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) chromium-sulfides are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy using graphene as a substrate. Structure characterization by employing scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron diffraction indicates that there are two 2D phases, Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D and Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D, which have not been reported before. Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D is related to bulk Cr$_5$S$_6$, but thinner than a bulk unit cell. For Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D, an even thinner material, no bulk counterpart exists. Both 2D materials are found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions and exhibit interesting electronic properties. Extensive first-principles calculations provide further insight into the electronic structure of these systems and indicate that they should be magnetic. Surprisingly, CrS$_2$ recently reported from density functional theory calculations and experiments could not be fabricated.

Abstract: Atomic-scale ferroelectrics are of great interest for high-density electronics, particularly field-effect transistors, low-power logic, and nonvolatile memories. We devised a film with a layered structure of bismuth oxide that can stabilize the ferroelectric state down to 1 nanometer through samarium bondage. This film can be grown on a variety of substrates with a cost-effective chemical solution deposition. We observed a standard ferroelectric hysteresis loop down to a thickness of ~1 nanometer. The thin films with thicknesses that range from 1 to 4.56 nanometers possess a relatively large remanent polarization from 17 to 50 microcoulombs per square centimeter. We verified the structure with first-principles calculations, which also pointed to the material being a lone pair-driven ferroelectric material. The structure design of the ultrathin ferroelectric films has great potential for the manufacturing of atomic-scale electronic devices.

Abstract: In this work we provide a comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental studies of the properties of polarons formed by mobile impurities strongly interacting with quantum many-body systems. We present a unified perspective on the universal concepts and theoretical techniques used to characterize polarons in two distinct platforms, ultracold atomic gases and atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides, which are linked by many deep parallels. We review polarons in both fermionic and bosonic environments, highlighting their similarities and differences including the intricate interplay between few- and many-body physics. Various kinds of polarons with long-range interactions or in magnetic backgrounds are discussed, and the theoretical and experimental progress towards understanding interactions between polarons is described. We outline how polaron physics, regarded as the low density limit of quantum mixtures, provides fundamental insights regarding the phase diagram of complex condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we describe how polarons may serve as quantum sensors of many-body physics in complex environments. Our work highlights the open problems, identifies new research directions and provides a comprehensive framework for this rapidly evolving research field.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic phase diagram of the bilayer triangular antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$, unveiling a rich interplay between geometric frustration, bilayer coupling, and symmetry-driven phenomena. High-field magnetization measurements reveal fractional magnetization plateaus at 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 5/6 of the saturation magnetization. To elucidate the experimental magnetic phase diagram at low fields, we propose that K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ can be described as an easy-axis triangular weak-dimer antiferromagnet. We emphasize the critical role of the emergent $U(1) \otimes S_3$ symmetry, where $S_3 = \mathbb{Z}_3 \otimes \mathbb{Z}_2^d$, in determining the magnetic phases at low fields. The remarkable agreement between the experimental and theoretical phase diagrams suggests that the phase transitions are governed by this symmetry. Notably, our combined experimental and theoretical results identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase region at finite fields. These findings provide new insights into the phase structure of frustrated magnets and establish K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$ as a compelling platform for exploring unconventional quantum phenomena in $U(1) \otimes S_3$ systems.

Abstract: In geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, weak interactions or slight changes to the structure can tip the delicate balance of exchange interactions, sending the system into a different ground state. Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, has a copper sublattice composed of distorted triangles, making it a likely host for frustrated magnetism, but exhibits stacking disorder. The lack of synthetic single crystals has limited research on the magnetism in brochantite to powders and natural mineral crystals. We grew crystals which we find to be a new polytype with a tendency toward ABAC stacking and some anion disorder, alongside the expected stacking disorder. Comparison to previous results on natural mineral specimens suggests that cation disorder is more deleterious to the magnetism than anion and stacking disorder. Our specific heat data suggest a double transition on cooling into the magnetically ordered state.

Abstract: Motivated by the newly discovered Co-based superconductor Na2CoSe2O, we performed systematic calculations of its electronic band structures using the density functional theory (DFT) plus the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approaches. Our comparative studies reveal weakly correlated and itinerant nature of the Co-3d electrons and show no sign of fluctuating local moments as expected in many other unconventional superconductors, although the Co eg orbitals are close to half filling. These suggest that Na2CoSe2O is a normal paramagnetic metal and its superconductivity might not be of strongly correlated nature, contrary to the initial speculation. We suggest future investigations of electron-phonon interactions to clarify its pairing mechanism.

Abstract: The potential applications of dilute magnetic oxides (DMOs) in magneto-optic and spintronic devices have attracted significant attention, although understanding their magnetic behavior is complex due to intricate interactions of intrinsic defects. The present study aims to investigate the effect of different annealing environments on the magnetic properties of polycrystalline transition metal cation (Co and Y) doped CeO2 DMO with a 5% doping concentration of transition metal (TM). The objective is to investigate the defect interactions within the lattice through a comprehensive investigation involving structural characterizations, magnetic measurements, and first principle calculations. The results show that the Ar/H2 annealing environment induced more oxygen vacancies than air-annealed samples. Consequently, field-dependent magnetization measurements revealed above-room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) in both un-doped and TM-doped CeO2. The ferromagnetic (FM) properties of CeO2 resulted from carrier-trapped vacancy centers facilitating exchange interactions between the spins of magnetic ions. The Langevin field profile indicated that TM-doped CeO2 formed more bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) during annealing in an Ar/H2 environment, which contributed to the enhanced ferromagnetism. Similarly, enhancement in the magnetic properties with increasing oxygen vacancies is observed through first principle calculations. This suggests the potential for optimizing the magnetic properties of DMOs through controlled annealing processes.

Abstract: The rare physical property of negative thermal expansion (NTE) is intriguing because materials with large NTE over a wide temperature range can serve as high-performance thermal expansion compensators. However, applications of NTE are hindered by the fact that most of the available NTE materials show small magnitudes of NTE, and/or NTE occurs only in a narrow temperature range. Herein, for the first time, we investigated the effect of anion substitution instead of general Pb/Ti-site substitutions on the thermal expansion properties of a typical ferroelectric NTE material, PbTiO3. Intriguingly, the substitution of S for O in PbTiO3 further increases the tetragonality of PbTiO3. Consequently, an unusually enhanced NTE with an average volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion $\bar{\alpha}_V$ = -2.50 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K was achieved over a wide temperature range (300 -- 790 K), which is contrasted to that of pristine PbTiO3 ($\bar{\alpha}_V$ = -1.99 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K RT -- 763 K). The intensified NTE is attributed to the enhanced hybridization between Pb/Ti and O/S atoms by the substitution of S, as evidenced by our theoretical investigations. We therefore demonstrate a new technique for introducing mixed anions to achieve large NTE over a wide temperature range in PbTiO3-based ferroelectrics.

Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene displays a complex phase diagram as a function of flat band filling, featuring compressibility cascade transitions and a variety of competing ground states with broken spin, valley and point group symmetries. Recent THz photocurrent spectroscopy experiments have shown a dependence on the filling which is not consistent with the simplest cascade picture of sequential filling of equivalent flat bands. In this work, we show that when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to valley polarization, a magnetic injection photocurrent develops which can be used to distinguish different spin-valley polarization scenarios. Using the topological heavy fermion model we compute both shift and injection currents as a function of filling and argue that current experiments can be used to determine the spontaneous valley polarization.

Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical tranduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. Due to the quadratic scaling of transduction efficiency with the electro-optic coefficient, material classes with stronger Pockels effects, such as the perovskite titanates BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, may unlock new performance regimes for future transducers. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response, as well as limited process compatibility. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. Exploiting the bias-induced Pockels effect of BaTiO$_3$, we demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction at millikelvin temperatures and total off-chip efficiencies reaching $1\times10^{-6}$ in pulsed operation. We establish a device concept permitting in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss and tuning of the optical system without sacrificing microwave-optical overlap. Using a fully subtractive process, we fabricate Nb air bridges for crossings of conductors and both air- and oxide-clad optical waveguides. We investigate optically-induced heating through pulsed optical pumping, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept is applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and paves the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.

Abstract: Many magnetic materials are predicted to exhibit bosonic topological edge modes in their excitation spectra, because of the nontrivial topology of their magnon, triplon, or other quasi-particle band structures. However, there is a discrepancy between theory prediction and experimental observation, which suggests some underlying mechanism that intrinsically suppresses the expected experimental signatures, like the thermal Hall current. Many-body interactions that are not accounted for in the non-interacting quasi-particle picture are most often identified as the reason for the absence of the topological edge modes. Here we report persistent bosonic edge modes at the boundaries of a ladder quantum paramagnet with gapped triplon excitations in the presence of the full many-body interaction. We use tensor network methods to resolve topological edge modes in the time-dependent spin-spin correlations and the dynamical structure factor, which is directly accessible experimentally. We further show that signatures of these edge modes survive even when the non-interacting quasi-particle theory breaks down, discuss the topological phase diagram of the model, demonstrate the fractionalization of its low-lying excitations, and propose potential material candidates.

Abstract: Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) indicate an unusual coexistence of heavy and light electrons, a characteristic of heavy-fermion physics. But a global transport measurement showing clear signatures of strong correlations like local moments (LM) arising from the flatbands is missing. Utilizing thermopower ($V_{Th}$) as a sensitive probe for measuring entropy ($S$), we have extensively studied $V_{Th}$ of MATBLG with filling ($\nu$), temperature ($T$) and magnetic field ($B$), and unveiled the presence of LM through their impact on $S$. While at high $T$, the behavior of $V_{Th}$ and resistance ($R$) are related by the Mott formula, it deviates at lower $T$. Below 120K apart from the Dirac point and full band filling, the resistance exhibits prominent peaks at integer fillings. The $V_{Th}$ however, remains featureless and symmetric across the DP with opposite signs. This disparity implies the dominance of different kinds of carriers in $V_{Th}$ and $R$. The $V_{Th}$ has additional sign changes at $\nu_{cross} \sim \pm 1$. The locations of $\nu_{cross}$ do not change with temperature from $5-60K$. For heavy and light band electrons, it can be shown that the doping profile of the $V_{Th}$, and hence $\nu_{cross}$ is highly sensitive to $T$, and therefore solely the contribution from band electrons does not explain the $V_{Th}$ data. Our data is consistent with the dominant contribution arising from the $S$ of the LMs. Additionally, we have investigated the effect of $B$ on the $V_{Th}$, both $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$ showing 30 and 50$\%$ reduction, respectively, and can be attributed to the partial polarization of the LMs (spin/valley), resulting in decreased $S$. Our $V_{Th}$ results highlight the contribution from LMs arising from flatbands, distinct from the band contributions of heavy and light fermions to the resistivity in MATBLG.

Abstract: Trigonal Cr5Te8, a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet with an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, has long been known to crystallize in a centrosymmetric structure. However, optical second harmonic generation experiments, together with comprehensive structural analysis, indicate that this compound rather adopts a non-centrosymmetric structure. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy reveals the presence of N\'eel-type skyrmions, consistent with its non-centrosymmetric structure. A large anomalous Hall conductivity of 102 ohm^-1cm^-1 at low temperature stems from intrinsic origin, which is larger than any previously reported values in the bulk Cr-Te system. Notably, spontaneous topological Hall resistivity arising from the skyrmionic phase has been observed. Our findings not only elucidate the unique magnetic and magneto-transport properties of non-centrosymmetric trigonal Cr5Te8, but also open new avenues for investigating the effects of broken inversion symmetry on material properties and their potential applications.

Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the magnetic properties exhibited by twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems with small twist angles, where the appearance of flat minibands strongly enhances electron-electron interaction effects. We show that, at three-quarters filling of the conduction miniband, the Stoner mechanism induces a ferromagnetic polarization in the AA-stacking regions, which aligns with recent experimental observations. Our approach models the electronic properties by a tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with a Hubbard mean-field interaction term. We employ a real-space recursion technique to self-consistently calculate the system's local density of states and use our method to investigate the magnetic properties of small-angle TBG at three-quarters filling. The recursion method's $O({\cal N})$ efficiency makes it possible to address extremely large superlattices through a full real-space approach. We validate our procedure by comparing it with mean-field momentum-space calculations from the literature, which identify a magnetic phase in charge-neutral TBGs.

Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. When the existence probability of each edge follows a Bernoulli distribution, we rigorously prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models with appropriate parameterization coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results is a broad generalization of the result of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) with appropriate parameterization was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model).

Abstract: Altermagnets are defined as magnetic states with fully compensated spin angular momenta (spins) and broken PT (P: parity, T: time reversal, PT: parity times time reversal) symmetry. We classify three kinds of altermagnets: M-type: broken T symmetry and nonzero net magnetic moments, S-type: broken T symmetry and zero net magnetic moments, and A-type: unbroken T and broken P symmetries. Furthermore, strong altermagnets have spin split bands through exchange coupling in the non-relativistic limit, i.e., for zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and weak altermagnets has spin split bands only with non-zero SOC. These strong vs. weak altermagnets can be identified from the total number of symmetric orthogonal spin rotation operations. These classifications of altermagnets will be an essential guidance for the future research on altermagnetism.

Abstract: Explicit interactions, \textit{e.g.}, dipolar and exchange couplings, usually govern magnetization dynamics. Some interactions may be hidden from the global crystal symmetry. We report that in a large class of \textit{uniaxial} antiferromagnets, a \textit{hidden} Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction with retaining global inversion symmetry quenches the spin of magnon along the N\'eel vector ${\bf n}$, thus forbidding its angular-momentum flow. Some magnon spins, termed ``nodal" and ``corner" spins, survive when they distribute \textit{singularly} at the hot spots, i.e., high-symmetric degeneracy points in the Brillouin zone, and are protected by crystal symmetries. The biased magnetic field along ${\bf n}$ broadens such distributions, allowing bulk spin transport with unique signatures in the magnetic field and temperature dependencies. This explains recent experiments and highlights the role of hidden interaction.

Abstract: We investigate the excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer spin chain by employing a combination of numerical and theoretical techniques. Utilizing the Krylov-space correction-vector method in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we calculate both the direct and indirect resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra for the trimer spin chain. To interpret the observed features in the RIXS spectra, we perform a theoretical perturbative analysis to compute the energy dispersions which are then utilized to determine the density of states (DOS) for both the single-particle and the two-particle excitation spectra. Our results show that the single-particle continua of the direct RIXS spectrum align with the energy levels observed in the DOS spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations. Furthermore, the two-particle continua are revealed in the indirect RIXS process, where all possible single particle excitations combine to form the various two-particle excitations of the trimer spin chain. Based on our calculations, we propose the RIXS mechanism of generating the fractionalized (spinon) and collective (doublon and quarton) excitations in the trimer spin chain at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge, including discussing the interplay of these excitations in the RIXS spectrum for various trimer coupling strength. The computed energy range of the excitations suggest the possibility of experimental detection at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge within the current capabilities of RIXS instrumentation resolution.

Abstract: We analyzed mathematically a model describing flux jumps in superconductivity in a 1D configuration. Three effects occur from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the equations showed that magnetic field fronts penetrate the material as inhomogeneous Burgers fronts. An additional nonlinear term affects the magnetic field and is responsible for flux jumps. We considered a medium temperature for which the heat capacity of a sample can be assumed constant and a low temperature where heat capacity depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. We found that flux jumps occur for pulses of duration close to the magnetic relaxation time and mostly at low temperature. Flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitude long duration pulses and low to medium temperatures.

Abstract: A method for locating first order saddle points on the energy surface of a magnetic system is described and several applications presented where the mechanism of various magnetic transitions is identified. The starting point for the iterative search algorithm can be anywhere, even close to a local energy minimum representing an initial state of the system, and the final state need not be specified. Convergence on a saddle point is obtained by inverting the component of the gradient along the minimum mode, thereby effectively transforming the neighbourhood of the saddle point to that of a local minimum. The method requires only the lowest two eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the Hessian of the system's energy and they are found using a quasi-Newton limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno solver for the minimization of the Rayleigh quotient without explicit evaluation of the Hessian. The method is applicable to large systems as the computational effort scales linearly with system size. Applications are presented to transitions in systems that reveal significant complexity of co-existing magnetic states, such as skyrmions, skyrmion bags, skyrmion tubes, chiral bobbers, and globules. When combined with rate theory within the harmonic approximation, the method can be used for simulations of the long timescale dynamics of complex magnetic systems characterized by multiple metastable states.

Abstract: The use of high quality factor resonators is of undoubted interest for high precision measurements and for applications in quantum technologies. Novel types of microwave sensors can be realized by coupling a first resonator acting as a stable frequency reference with a second resonator that is sensitive to a particular physical quantity. Here we report on a coupled cavity configuration in which a high $Q$-factor elliptical TESLA-shaped superconducting cavity is coupled with a high permittivity ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$) SrTiO$_3$ puck, whose resonant frequency varies as a function of temperature due to the temperature dependence of the permittivity that reaches values higher than 30000 below 1 K. Extensive electromagnetic simulations are used to test different coupling configurations, showing great versatility to tune the coupling in the weak or strong regime, depending on the puck's position within the cavity. Moreover, for the coupled system, they allow one to investigate the dependence of the zero transmission frequency value on changes of the permittivity $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, obtaining a maximum value of 2.8 MHz per unit change of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, for $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \approx 230$. Finally, we discuss a specific application of the coupled system as a bolometer in different temperature ranges.

Abstract: Tree roots can support and transmit nutrients for trees healthy growth aboveground, which greatly improve trees productivity and have significant effect on maintaining the normal operation of ecosystem. In order to map the tree roots more efficiently and effectively, the nondestructive ground penetrating radar is introduced into this area. The construction of tree roots model mainly conducted by the profile matrix which stored electromagnetic parameters of tree roots, ground penetrating radar set the normalized first derivative Blackman-Harris window function as the source pulse. Two-way travel time, the electromagnetic pulses arriving at root zone and then reflected back to the receive antenna, which can be calculated by two-dimensional Finite-Difference Time-Domain. Finally synthesized the common-offset reflection data that extracted from the output multi-offset data cube as radargrams which contain the information about buried tree roots. The results turned out that through interaction between electromagnetic pulse and underground anomalies, the distribution information related subsurface buried tree roots can be observed accurately from radargrams, in addition to the intermediate section shielded by tree roots barrier, the dipping boundary between clay layer and bedrock layer is clear enough to be noticed. With the increase of radar frequency, the electromagnetic pulse meet severe attenuation accompanied by the detection depth decrease, thus the texture in radargram gradually blurred. These relatively accurate roots outline, calculated by numerical simulation, showed that the application of ground penetrating radar in tree roots detection can significantly improve resolution of roots which stretched in the vertical direction.

Abstract: Unidirectional propagation based on surface magnetoplasmons (SMPs) has recently been realized at the interface of magnetized semiconductors. However, usually SMPs lose their unidirectionality due to non-local effects, especially in the lower trivial bandgap of such structures. More recently, a truly unidirectional SMP (USMP) has been demonstrated in the upper topological non-trivial bandgap, but it supports only a single USMP, limiting its functionality. In this work, we present a fundamental physical model for multiple, robust, truly topological USMP modes at terahertz (THz) frequencies, realized in a semiconductor-dielectric-semiconductor (SDS) slab waveguide under opposing external magnetic fields. We analytically derive the dispersion properties of the SMPs and perform numerical analysis in both local and non-local models. Our results show that the SDS waveguide supports two truly (even and odd) USMP modes in the upper topological non-trivial bandgap. Exploiting these two modes, we demonstrate unidirectional SMP multimode interference (USMMI), being highly robust and immune to backscattering, overcoming the back-reflection issue in conventional bidirectional waveguides. To demonstrate the usefullness of this approach, we numerically realize a frequency- and magnetically-tunable arbitrary-ratio splitter based on this robust USMMI, enabling multimode conversion. We, further, identify a unique index-near-zero (INZ) odd USMP mode in the SDS waveguide, distinct from conventional semiconductor-dielectric-metal waveguides. Leveraging this INZ mode, we achieve phase modulation with a phase shift from -$\pi$ to $\pi$. Our work expands the manipulation of topological waves and enriches the field of truly non-reciprocal topological physics for practical device applications.

Abstract: Magnetic holes (MHs) are coherent structures characterized by a strong and localized magnetic field amplitude dip, commonly observed in the solar wind and planetary magnetosheaths. These structures come in different sizes, from magnetohydrodynamic to kinetic scales. Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) observations have revealed electron scale MHs to be ubiquitous in the turbulent Earth's magnetosheath, potentially playing an important role in the energy cascade and dissipation. Despite abundant observations, the origin of electron scale MHs is still unclear and debated. In this work, we use fully kinetic simulations to investigate the role of plasma turbulence in generating electron scale MHs. We perform a fully kinetic simulation of freely decaying plasma turbulence, initialized with typical Earth's magnetosheath parameters. We find that electron scale MHs can be generated by turbulence via the following mechanism: first, large-scale turbulent velocity shears produce regions with high electron temperature anisotropy; these localized regions become unstable, generating oblique electron scale whistler waves; as they propagate over the inhomogeneous turbulent background, whistler fluctuations develop an electrostatic component, turning into Bernstein-like modes; the strong electrostatic fluctuations produce current filaments that merge into an electron scale current vortex; the resulting electron vortex locally reduces the magnetic field amplitude, finally evolving into an electron scale MH. We show that MHs generated by this mechanism have properties consistent with MMS observations and nontrivial kinetic features. We provide numerical evidence of a new electron scale MH generation mechanism, driven by turbulence. Our results have potential implications for understanding the formation and occurrence of electron scale MHs in turbulent environments, such as the Earth's magnetosheath.

Abstract: Swift electrons passing near or through metallic structures have proven to be an excellent tool for studying plasmons and other types of confined optical modes involving collective charge oscillations in the materials hybridized with electromagnetic fields. In this work, we provide a general analytical framework for the simulation of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in infinite systems with cylindrical symmetry, such as wires, holes, and optical fibers. While EELS theory is well developed for electrons moving parallel to the direction of translational symmetry, we introduce closed-form analytical solutions for perpendicular electron trajectories. These analytical results are corroborated by comparison to numerical simulations based on a frequency-domain boundary-element method and a discontinuous-Galerkin time-domain finite-element method. Numerical methods further allow us to study termination effects in finite-sized cylindrical objects such as nanorods. The present study of the interaction between free electrons and cylindrically symmetric photonics systems can find application in the analysis of EELS spectra and the design of free-electron--photonic hybrid systems.

Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical tranduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. Due to the quadratic scaling of transduction efficiency with the electro-optic coefficient, material classes with stronger Pockels effects, such as the perovskite titanates BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, may unlock new performance regimes for future transducers. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response, as well as limited process compatibility. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. Exploiting the bias-induced Pockels effect of BaTiO$_3$, we demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction at millikelvin temperatures and total off-chip efficiencies reaching $1\times10^{-6}$ in pulsed operation. We establish a device concept permitting in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss and tuning of the optical system without sacrificing microwave-optical overlap. Using a fully subtractive process, we fabricate Nb air bridges for crossings of conductors and both air- and oxide-clad optical waveguides. We investigate optically-induced heating through pulsed optical pumping, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept is applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and paves the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the relationships between film growth conditions, crystalline microstructure, and magnetic properties of epitaxial Yttrium Iron Garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) thin films, deposited on Gallium Gadolinium Garnet (Ga$_3$Gd$_5$O$_{12}$, GGG). A direct correlation was observed between the residual epitaxial strain, bulk magnetic properties like saturation magnetization and magnetic damping), and the performance of spin-wave transmission devices based on these films. This correlation offers a pathway for a simplified, rapid assessment of YIG film quality, avoiding the need for complex time-consuming characterization techniques. In addition, we report a comprehensive investigation into the influence of pulsed-laser deposition parameters, including deposition temperature, pressure, laser fluence, frequency, and annealing conditions. Through systematic deposition optimization, state-of-the-art YIG films exhibiting ultralow magnetic damping could be obtained, which is critical for high-performance spintronic applications.

Abstract: Neural implicit k-space representations (NIK) have shown promising results for dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high temporal resolutions. Yet, reducing acquisition time, and thereby available training data, results in severe performance drops due to overfitting. To address this, we introduce a novel self-supervised k-space loss function $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{PISCO}$, applicable for regularization of NIK-based reconstructions. The proposed loss function is based on the concept of parallel imaging-inspired self-consistency (PISCO), enforcing a consistent global k-space neighborhood relationship without requiring additional data. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on static and dynamic MR reconstructions show that integrating PISCO significantly improves NIK representations. Particularly for high acceleration factors (R$\geq$54), NIK with PISCO achieves superior spatio-temporal reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an extensive analysis of the loss assumptions and stability shows PISCO's potential as versatile self-supervised k-space loss function for further applications and architectures.

Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.

Abstract: The rare physical property of negative thermal expansion (NTE) is intriguing because materials with large NTE over a wide temperature range can serve as high-performance thermal expansion compensators. However, applications of NTE are hindered by the fact that most of the available NTE materials show small magnitudes of NTE, and/or NTE occurs only in a narrow temperature range. Herein, for the first time, we investigated the effect of anion substitution instead of general Pb/Ti-site substitutions on the thermal expansion properties of a typical ferroelectric NTE material, PbTiO3. Intriguingly, the substitution of S for O in PbTiO3 further increases the tetragonality of PbTiO3. Consequently, an unusually enhanced NTE with an average volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion $\bar{\alpha}_V$ = -2.50 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K was achieved over a wide temperature range (300 -- 790 K), which is contrasted to that of pristine PbTiO3 ($\bar{\alpha}_V$ = -1.99 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K RT -- 763 K). The intensified NTE is attributed to the enhanced hybridization between Pb/Ti and O/S atoms by the substitution of S, as evidenced by our theoretical investigations. We therefore demonstrate a new technique for introducing mixed anions to achieve large NTE over a wide temperature range in PbTiO3-based ferroelectrics.

Abstract: A method for locating first order saddle points on the energy surface of a magnetic system is described and several applications presented where the mechanism of various magnetic transitions is identified. The starting point for the iterative search algorithm can be anywhere, even close to a local energy minimum representing an initial state of the system, and the final state need not be specified. Convergence on a saddle point is obtained by inverting the component of the gradient along the minimum mode, thereby effectively transforming the neighbourhood of the saddle point to that of a local minimum. The method requires only the lowest two eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the Hessian of the system's energy and they are found using a quasi-Newton limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno solver for the minimization of the Rayleigh quotient without explicit evaluation of the Hessian. The method is applicable to large systems as the computational effort scales linearly with system size. Applications are presented to transitions in systems that reveal significant complexity of co-existing magnetic states, such as skyrmions, skyrmion bags, skyrmion tubes, chiral bobbers, and globules. When combined with rate theory within the harmonic approximation, the method can be used for simulations of the long timescale dynamics of complex magnetic systems characterized by multiple metastable states.

# Simple, scalable production of ricinoleic acid-functionalized superparamagnetic nanoparticles, size- and shape-tunable, hydrophobic and hydrophilic

**Authors:** Sukumaran, Vasudevan

Materials properties at reduced dimensions are heavily influenced by both size and shape and, consequently, the synthetic approach. The synthesis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs)  has been extensively explored in the literature; however, preparative routes that allow for precise particle size and shape tunability with the scope for surface functionalization and industrial scalability remain challenging. Secondly, taking into account the importance of green chemistry in nanomaterial synthesis, a synthetic protocol that limits the use of harmful chemicals is highly solicited. In this work, we outline a simple one-pot decomposition route that avoids the complexities involved in the preparation, separation, and purification of precursor complexes required of traditional preparative routes and, consequently, is easily scalable. Ricinoleic acid was employed as a greener alternative to oleic acid as both the metal complexing and the capping agent. The modified thermal decomposition route effectively bypasses the demanding precursor synthesis steps of the traditional thermal decomposition route while retaining its advantages. Minor modifications in the preparation scheme allow for the control of particle size and shape. Additionally, a simple and general NTA-mediated ligand-exchange protocol was outlined that can directly transfer the hydrophobic nanoparticles from the non-aqueous reaction mixture to an aqueous phase without the need for product separation from the crude reaction mixture. The general approach reported was extended to prepare monodispersed binary and ternary ferrite nanoparticles. Hydroxylation of the surface-attached ricinolate ligands was explored as a ligand modification strategy to render the nanoparticles hydrophilic and, thus, water-dispersible. X-ray diffraction indicated the presence of magnetite and maghemite phases. TEM images showed monodispersed nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. EDS mapping showed the uniformity in cation distribution over the nanoparticles. XPS spectra were recorded for elemental analysis. The nanoparticles were superparamagnetic with a saturation magnetization of 41 emu/g.
