# Exploring the Conformational Effects of N- and C-Methylation of N-acylhydrazones

## 探索N-酰基hydr的N-和C-甲基化的构象效应

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bq95l?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Daniel, Rodrigues

N-acylhydrazones (NAH) are privileged structures in chemistry and medicinal chemistry. The alkylation of NAH can profoundly alter the structural properties of this subunit. In this study, we describe the conformational effects of N- and C-methylated N-acylhydrazones derivatives, combining theoretical and experimental data analysis. Methylation of NAH significantly affects the structure through electronic influences and changes in the lowest energy conformation. The introduction of the methyl group induces a substantial steric impact, evident from the alterations in the conjugation of the NAH framework as analyzed by theoretical studies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data. Among the series, the compound with two methyl groups is the most anomalous. Despite having two methyl groups, this compound exhibits greater polarity than the compound with a single methyl group on the amide nitrogen, as determined by thin-layer chromatography. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the chemical properties of alkylated NAH derivatives and can guide their application in various branches of chemistry and medicinal chemistry.

# Achieving Multiway Switching in 2D Hexagonal Networks: A Molecular Engineering Strategy to Design Ambient Temperature Bistable Materials

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-4n622?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Mathieu , Rouzières

Magnetic materials exhibiting bistability at ambient condition are appealing for application in high-density memory, data storage, sensing and switches devices. Octacyanometallates have been extensively studied as building blocks for constructing novel molecular magnetic materials with exciting physical properties. Here, we have designed and synthesized two cyanide bridged 2D hexagonal networks using octacyanotungstate(V) building block where {[W(CN)8]2[Co(V-im)4]3}n(1) undergoes a single-crystal to single-crystal (SC-SC) structural transformation to form {[W(CN)8]2[Co(V-im)4]2[Co(V-im)2(DMF)2].4H2O}n (2). Complex 1 exhibits reversible thermo-induced metal-to-metal electron transfer (MMET) (T1/2 = 176 K) with a 12 K thermal hysteresis width while complex 2 exhibits near ambient temperature two-step MMET (heating: T1/2(1) 324 K, T1/2(2) 340 K; cooling: T1/2(1) 286 K, T1/2(2) 232 K) with a hysteresis width of 4 and 15 K respectively. Interestingly, light-induced reversible ON/OFF MMET has also been observed for both complexes (1 and 2) using 808 nm and 900 nm lights (ON mode) and 405 and 635 (OFF mode) respectively, converting the low-temperature diamagnetic {WIVLS-CN-CoIIILS} ground-state into the metastable paramagnetic {WVLS-CN-CoIIHS} phase and vice-versa . X-ray absorption spectroscopy was performed in order to investigate the local electronic structure and magnetization associated with the MMET between the W and Co metal centres.

# Competing Orbital Magnetism and Superconductivity in electrostatically defined Josephson Junctions of Alternating Twisted Trilayer Graphene

## 在交替扭曲的三层石墨烯的静电定义的约瑟夫森结中竞争轨道磁性和超导性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5756127/latest

The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism within a single material system represents a long-standing goal in condensed matter physics. Van der Waals-based moir&eacute; superlattices provide an exceptional platform for exploring competing and coexisting broken symmetry states. Alternating twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) exhibits robust superconductivity at the magic angle of 1.57&deg; and 1.3&deg;, with suppression at intermediate twist angles. In this study, we investigate the intermediate regime and uncover evidence of orbital magnetism. As previously reported, superconductivity is suppressed near the charge neutrality point (CNP) and emerges at larger moir&eacute; fillings. Conversely, we find orbital magnetism most substantial near the CNP, diminishing as superconductivity develops. This complementary behavior is similarly observed in the displacement field phase space, highlighting a competitive interplay between the two phases. Utilizing gate-defined Josephson junctions, we probe orbital magnetism by electrostatically tuning the weak links into the magnetic phase, revealing an asymmetric Fraunhofer interference pattern. The estimated orbital ferromagnetic ordering temperature is approximately half the superconducting critical temperature, coinciding with the onset of Fraunhofer asymmetry. Our findings suggest that the observed orbital magnetism is driven by valley polarization and is distinct from the anomalous Hall effect reported at integer fillings in twisted graphene systems. These results offer insights into the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in moir&eacute; superlattices.

# Characterizing unculturable bacteria that can sense the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field

## 表征可以感知地球磁场的不可培养细菌

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6023812/latest

There are bacteria that can sense the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field and even use it to navigate. These bacteria are called magnetotactic bacteria. Magnetotactic bacteria from the group Nitrospirota are common in aquatic ecosystems. But, compared to other magnetotactic bacteria, magnetotactic Nitrospirota produce far more magnetic particles within each cell. Yet, little is known about these incredible bacteria because they are difficult to grow in the lab. So, researchers developed a new workflow that does not require culturing the bacteria. The workflow combined target-specific mini-metagenomics, which is a sequencing method to identify the microbes; rRNA-based in situ hybridization, which allows linking the morphology to phylogeny; and Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) to detect metabolites. The team found the first evidence that magnetotactic Nitrospirota &lsquo;fix&rsquo; carbon dioxide into usable organic molecules, and that they may &lsquo;reduce&rsquo; nitrate to nitrite, which is a key part of the nitrogen cycle. The new workflow also only required 10 uncultured natural bacteria cells to generate a high-quality draft genome for use in later studies. Overall, this study offers a promising new way for researchers to study uncultured microbes from natural environments and improves our understanding of magnetotactic Nitrospirota.

# Clavicle nonunion: management and considerations

## 锁骨骨不连: 管理和注意事项

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6022519/latest

Clavicle fractures can fail to heal, a condition called nonunion or pseudoarthrosis, in up to 24% of patients who receive conservative treatment. In contrast, pseudoarthrosis only occurs in 1.4% of patients who undergo surgery. Pseudoarthrosis risk factors include fracture location, displacement, fracture type, sex, accident severity and refractures. Patients typically present with pain as the primary symptom but may also show malalignment, instability, neurological symptoms, and restricted shoulder mobility. Diagnosis is confirmed with X-ray imaging, but computer tomography (CT) scans may also be used. Treatment is only needed in symptomatic cases. In these cases, nonoperative methods like magnetic field therapy and ultrasound can have limited efficacy, and surgery is required to address pain, movement limitations, and neurovascular issues. Surgical intervention involves angular stable osteosynthesis to restore vitality, bone length, and stability. The anteroinferior plate position offers a good alternative to the superior plate position when surgical pretreatment was performed. While surgical interventions such as these offer a high healing rate, they carry a greater risk of infection than non-invasive techniques. Overall, successful treatment of symptomatic nonunion requires precise evaluation of tissue vitality.

# Shock Reformation Induced by Ion-scale Whistler Waves in Quasi-perpendicular Bow Shock

## 准垂直弓激波中离子尺度哨声波引起的激波重整

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6012766/latest

Studies have long suggested that shocks can undergo cyclical self-reformation as a type of shock nonstationarity. Until now, providing solid evidence for shock reformation in spacecraft observation and identifying its generating mechanisms remain challenging. In this work, by analyzing Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observations, we unambiguously identified shock reformation occurring in a quasi-perpendicular shock. A 2-D particle-in-cell simulation reproduces and explains the observed shock reformation. The simulation reveals that shock dynamics in the foot and ramp region generate two types of ion-scale whistler waves, respectively, each of which can drive shock reformation. Within one single wave period, the wave induces the magnetic field pile-up, ion accumulation and reflection, and upstream-pointing electric field, finally evolving into a new shock front. An interesting finding is that different shock dynamics compete and dominate the reformation at different stages. Our results not only provide evidence that the shock reformation in the present regime can be driven by ion-scale whistler waves, but also demonstrate the detailed kinetic processes how it happens, offering valuable insights into shock dynamics.

# A coronal mass ejection event cross-identified by both plasma motion and coronal dimming on AB Dor

## 通过AB Dor上的等离子体运动和日冕变暗交叉识别的日冕物质抛射事件

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5675039/latest

As one of the most violent phenomena known from the Sun, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), associated with escaping plasma energized by magnetic reconnection events, may lead to mass and angular momentum loss and cause very severe space weather disturbances around the Earth. CMEs are also thought to play key roles in stellar evolution, star-planet interaction and planetary habitability. On the Sun, CMEs have been studied intensively using the direct-imaging technique. For active stars, CMEs are expected to occur more frequently and strongly because of their higher activity levels reflecting by various statistics, yet the detection of stellar CMEs is quite challenging. So far only a handful of candidates have been reported, but all of them were identified by single indicator in a rather ambiguous fashion (Moschou et al, 2019; Argiroffi et al, 2019; Leitzinger and Odert, 2022). Here we report the high confidence discovery and characterization of a superflare-associated CME event on the rapidly rotating active star AB Dor, cross-identified by several diagnostics from solar CMEs. Using time-resolved high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of a superflare observed with the onboard Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) of the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) telescope (Jansen et al, 2001), we have detected coronal dimming by a decrease of electron density (ne) at the flare onset and decreases of flux, temperature (T) and emission measure (EM) at the end of decay phase, along with plasma motion indicating a high speed escape at $v_b sim 725 \pm 200\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{&minus;1}$ . These indicators robustly suggest the occurrence of a stellar CME event in analogy to the well known solar counterparts. We highlight the feasibility of searching for stellar CMEs in large X-ray spectroscopic archives of the XMM-Newton, Chandra, etc. by more detailed analyses.
