When it comes to layered quantum materials, current understanding only scratches the surface; so demonstrates a new study from the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI. Using advanced X-ray spectroscopy at the Swiss Light Source SLS, researchers uncovered magnetic phenomena driven by unexpected interactions between the layers of a kagome ferromagnet made from iron and tin. This discovery challenges assumptions about layered alloys of common metals, providing a starting point for developing new magnetoelectric devices and rare-earth-free motors.

# High-energy irradiation of matrix isolated acetic acid yields a  · CH 3 ⋯CO 2  complex: A spectroscopic and  ab initio  study

## 基质分离乙酸的高能辐照产生·CH 3·co 2络合物: 光谱和从头算研究

Link: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/162/7/074306/3336110/High-energy-irradiation-of-matrix-isolated-acetic

<span class="paragraphSection">The mechanism of the chemical transformations of isolated small organic molecules induced by high-energy radiation is of basic interest for astrophysics and astrochemistry. In this work, we first applied a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to identify the products of the radiation-induced transformations of isolated CH<sub>3</sub>COOH and CD<sub>3</sub>COOH molecules. As revealed by EPR, <sup>·</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> (or <sup>·</sup>CD<sub>3</sub>) is the principal primary radical generated from acetic acid in solid argon and xenon, while the FTIR results suggest that this radical is trapped mainly in the form of the <sup>·</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>⋯CO<sub>2</sub> radical–molecule complex. The assignment of this previously unknown complex was based on the complexation-induced shifts of the absorption bands corresponding to CH<sub>3OPLA</sub> and CO<sub>2bend</sub> vibration modes, confirmed by analysis of the kinetic curves, photochemical behavior, and comparison with the results of <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> computations at the spin-unrestricted coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples level of theory. Most likely, the complex in matrices adopts the geometry close to the theoretically predicted structure with <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span><sub><span style="font-style: italic;">s</span></sub> symmetry stabilized by the C⋯C and O⋯H interactions. It was suggested that the complex could be produced via the intermediate formation of a CH<sub>3</sub>COOH<sup>+·</sup> radical cation deprotonating to the CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>·</sup> radical, which promptly decomposed to <sup>·</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> fragments. We believe that the results obtained in this study may contribute to a better understanding of the processing of acetic acid molecules in astrophysically relevant ices under high-energy irradiation and give a valuable insight into the understanding of weak intermolecular interactions involving radicals relevant to atmospheric chemistry, combustion, and carbon dioxide conversion.</span>

Developing single-site catalysts (SSCs) with thermal stability and high activity towards exhaust oxidation is crucial yet challenging, due to sintering at severe reaction temperature and limited activity. Here, we report a Pt SSC with atomic-precision structures confined by both polyoxometalate (POM) and Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) NU1K, exhibits high oxidation activity and stability towards exhaust oxidation. Difference envelope density (DED) and pair distribution function (PDF) analyses showed that isolated PtV9O28 clusters are well-maintained in the c-pores of NU1K. The node-bound formate facilitates partial reduction of isolated Pt (IV) species in single crystals to Pt (II) species in isolated PtV9O28 clusters after encapsulation in NU1K with the generation of oxygen vacancy as demonstrated by 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). When the simultaneous oxidation of CO, C3H6, and C3H8 was performed on these fully exposed single-Pt sites, the T100 (temperature at 100% conversion) for CO and C3H6 oxidation significantly decreased by 100 °C on PtV9O28@NU1K compared to that of PtV9O28/ZrO2. Meanwhile, it completely oxidizes C3H8 at 260 °C, but C3H8 oxidation does not occur on PtV9O28/ZrO2 until 470 °C. Theoretical calculation shows C3H8 molecules are easily absorbed to Pt sites on isolated PtV9O27 cluster with the adsorption energy of -1.84eV. These molecularly defined SSCs structures facilitate understanding the origins of catalyst activity and designing fully dispersed catalysts with maximum atom efficiency.

**Authors:** Dmitry, Budker

Zero- to ultralow-field (ZULF) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides ac- cess to untruncated spin-spin interactions and—with its simplified instrumentation demands—emerges as a promising tool for chemical fingerprinting and fundamental physics. However, ZULF NMR J-spectra typically suffer from poor signal-to-noise ra- tios (SNRs) due to the low natural abundance of many heteronuclei. In this work we employ hyperpolarization via Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE) and various preparation, evolution, and signal detection schemes to demonstrate the control of many (10+) hyperpolarized nuclear spin orders in the XA3 spin system di- rectly inside a ZULF apparatus (here X corresponds to the 15N spin and A3 corresponds to the three protons). Acetonitrile solvent with natural isotopic abundance is used as a chemical model of the XA3 system. The results underscore the versatility and precision of ZULF NMR, highlighting its potential for applications in precision chemistry and fundamental physics.

# Metabolite Signatures and Their Mediation Effects on the Relationship Between Mediterranean Diet Adherence and MASLD Progression

## 代谢物特征及其对地中海饮食依从性与MASLD进展之间关系的中介作用

Background Mediterranean Diet (MED) is recommended for managing patients with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). However, the potential metabolic changes involved in this relationship remain unclear. This study aims to investigate how metabolic biomarkers mediate the association between MED adherence and liver-related events (LRE) and mortality in patients with MASLD.Methods  We performed a prospective analysis using UK Biobank data, including 47,429 MASLD participants free of LRE at baseline. MED adherence was assessed as alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED) score through a validated questionnaire covering 206 foods and 32 beverages. Metabolic biomarkers were measured using high-throughput nucleic magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Cox regression and restricted cubic splines assessed the association of aMED, its components, with risk of LRE and mortality. Mediation analysis evaluated the role of metabolites in the relationship between aMED, its components, and MASLD progression.Results Over a median follow-up of 13.3 years, 296 LRE cases and 3,616 deaths occurred. Higher aMED scores (6&amp;ndash;9) were associated with lower risks of LRE (HR: 0.553, 95% CI: 0.351&amp;ndash;0.874) and mortality (HR: 0.854, 95% CI: 0.762&amp;ndash;0.956) compared to the lowest scores (0&amp;ndash;3). Linear dose-response relationships were observed for both LRE incidence (Pnonlinear = 0.91) and mortality (Pnonlinear = 0.07). Certain aMED components, including vegetables and legumes, were associated with a reduced risk of LRE, while vegetables, nuts, fish, the MUFA:SFA ratio, and moderate alcohol intake were linked to lower mortality risk. Of 143 metabolites, 46 were significantly associated with aMED. Positive associations included very large HDL particles (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;3), unsaturated fatty acids (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;8), albumin, and acetate, while negative associations were found with large VLDL (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;11), small and middle HDL (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;13), saturated fatty acids (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;2), Apo-AI, and creatinine. Five aMED-related lipid metabolites were negatively associated with LRE, while five were positively linked to mortality. Mediation analysis revealed that omega-3 fatty acids, the omega-3 to total fatty acid ratio, and albumin accounted for 7.9%, 11.9%, and 2.6% of the reduction in LRE, and 19.4%, 23.1%, and 4.7% of the mitigation in mortality, respectively.Conclusions Adherence to MED is linked to reduced LRE risk and mortality in MASLD patients. Metabolic biomarkers such as small HDL particles and omega-3 fatty acids may mitigate MASLD progression.

# Comparison between old and new imaging modalities in the presurgical evaluation of children with intractable epilepsy

## 新旧影像学检查在儿童难治性癫痫术前评估中的比较

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5992280/latest

Background: Drug-resistant epilepsy is characterized by the failure of &amp;nbsp;adequate trials of two well selected anti-seizure drugs with tolerable side effects. Surgical intervention is often performed to mitigate or stop seizures. Different imaging techniques are used to evaluate those patients presurgically. Herein, we aimed to describe the correlation between seizure semiology, long term video-EEG and neuro-imaging modalities including high resolution three-dimensional structural brain MRI, ASL perfusion, brain volumetric analysis, and FDG-PET scans throughout the presurgical assessment of focal drug-resistant epilepsy patients.
Methodology: Here, 30 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included from our pediatric neurology clinic in a period from November 2021 till May 2023. History taking, full examination, 6&ndash;24-h long-term Video EEG recording (including ictal and inter-ictal recordings) and multiple neuro-imaging modalities were obtained from all patients. Thirty patients underwent structural MRI brain imaging, 27 patients underwent volumetry studies and 28 patients underwent magnetic resonance arterial spin labeling sequence. PET was done when no proper localization of seizures occurred (n=10).
Results: Our multimodal methodology indicated that among patients with focal DRE, temporal lobe epilepsy was the prevailing, impacting 12 patients (40%), followed by frontal lobe epilepsy, impacting 9 patients (30%). There was concordance between Ictal EEG and Inter-ictal EEG regarding the affected side, and the affected lobe. We also found concordance between structural MRI and ASL regarding the affected side and the affected lobe. In addition to between ASL, ictal EEG and PET scan.
Conclusion: Focal DRE patients necessitate meticulous multi-disciplinary assessment through detailed seizure semiology analysis, adequate long-term video EEG monitoring, and thorough neuro-imaging including already established techniques such as structural MRI and 18f-FDG PET brain scans and also new emerging techniques such as ASL and automated brain volumetry. Given the benefits of those new techniques regarding image quality, elevated accessibility, and the elimination of intravenous contrast agents, they are optimally suited for pediatric neuro-imaging during the pre-surgical evaluation of focal DRE.

# The Correlation Between Middle Frontal Gyrus Cortical Thickness and Working Memory in First-episode Treatment-na&iuml;ve Major Depressive Disorder

## 首发初治抑郁症患者额中回皮质厚度与工作记忆的相关性研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5978946/latest

Background: Cognitive impairment is regarded as a pivotal symptom of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Previous studies have indicated the presence of abnormalities in cortical thickness (CT) in patients with MDD. However, the relationship between cognitive performance and CT abnormalities in patients with MDD remains unclear. Our study purposed to survey the changes in CT in patients with MDD and their relationship with cognitive impairment.
Methods: A total of 105 patients with first-episode treatment-na&iuml;ve MDD and 53 healthy controls (HCs) received T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a series of neuropsychological tests. Initially the differences in CT and cognitive performance between patients with MDD and HCs were contrasted. Subsequently, the correlation between CT and cognitive performance were analyzed for significant changes.
Results: All five cognitive dimensions were significantly different between patients with MDD and HCs. Meanwhile, the CT of the bilateral precentral gyri and right middle frontal gyrus were reduced in the MDD group. Besides, the CT of the right middle frontal gyrus shows a positive relationship with working memory dimension scores of the MDD group.
Conclusion: CT abnormalities in patients with MDD are correlated with cognitive performance.
