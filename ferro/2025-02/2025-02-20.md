CsPbBr₃ (CPB) perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted considerable interest due to their outstanding charge carrier mobility, long diffusion lengths, and efficient visible light absorption, making them ideal candidates for photocatalysis, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, and photodetectors. However, their practical applications are limited by poor environmental stability. We employed a metal-organic framework (MOF) to address this challenge as a stabilizing matrix, selecting ZIF-8 for its exceptional thermal and chemical stability, high surface area, and versatile synthesis routes. The CPB/ZIF-8 nanocomposite was synthesized by integrating hot-injection-produced CPB nanocrystals with ZIF-8 using an optimized mixing approach, ensuring a uniform NCs distribution. Electron microscopy (EM) analysis confirmed the well-controlled and uniform distribution of the NCs on the surface of the ZIF-8. Moreover, the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed ligand exchange, where the imidazole linkers of the ZIF-8 structure replace the NCs ligands. The process promotes almost epitaxial attachment of the latter, thus promoting effective charge interactions in the integration process. The unshifted absorbance spectra verified the preservation of optical activity, whereas a 92% quenching in photoluminescence (PL) indicated efficient charge separation and reduced electron-hole recombination. To investigate charge transfer mechanisms, photocatalytic dye degradation under visible light irradiation was employed using methyl orange (MO) and bromocresol green (BCG) as model dyes. The CPB/ZIF-8 nanocomposite exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance, achieving 1.48 and 1.75 times higher degradation rates for MO and BCG, respectively, compared to pristine CPB NCs. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies demonstrated superior radical generation capabilities, particularly hydroxyl radicals (•OH), further confirming enhanced charge transfer and photocatalytic efficiency. These findings underscore the synergistic interaction between CPB NCs and ZIF-8, positioning the CPB/ZIF-8 nanocomposite as a promising material for photocatalysis and optoelectronic applications.

Objective Insufficient data exists about the examination of the impact of previous biopsies on complications in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (Mp-MRI) and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) fusion biopsies. We aimed to compare the complications of Mp-MRI / TRUS fusion transrectal prostate biopsy in patients who have not undergone a prostate biopsy before and in patients whose prior biopsy or biopsies.Methods The study consisted of a retrospective review of prospectively recorded data. The cohort of patients (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;780) was categorized into three groups: group 1 (biopsy naive patients, n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;390), group-2a (consisting of patients who underwent a single biopsy, n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;278), and group-2b (consisting of patients who underwent at least two biopsies, n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;112). The demographic data of the patients, comorbidities, prostate-specific antigen results, Mp-MRI characteristics, biopsy data, and complications were compared between the groups.Results There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of metabolic syndrome, anticoagulant use, urinary infection history in the last 3 months, and antibiotic use in the last 3 months. While there was no difference between the groups in terms of post-procedural complication rates, peri-procedural complications (urethrorrhagia and rectal bleeding) were significantly higher in group 2b than in the other two groups.Conclusion When considering the Mp-MRI / TRUS fusion prostate biopsy for patients with a history of two or more previous biopsies, it is important to consider the risk of bleeding and take proper precautions for this specific group of patients. Alternatively, a transperineal biopsy may be considered.

# Fasciitis-panniculitis syndrome with autoantibodies reacting to adipocyte pericellular fibers: A case report

## 自身抗体与脂肪细胞周围纤维反应的筋膜炎-脂膜炎综合征: 一例病例报告

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5941031/latest

Background: Fasciitis-panniculitis syndrome (FPS) typically presents with swelling and skin hardening. Its histopathological characteristics include inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrous thickening of the subcutaneous tissue and fascia. Panniculitides in children are rare and only a small number of juvenile FPS cases have been reported. We encountered a case of a 10-year-old boy in which autoantibodies reactive to adipocyte pericellular fibers were detected in relapsing FPS.
Case presentation: The patient developed a high fever and skin swelling with pain and erythema on the right side of his body following an abrasion injury on his right wrist at the age of 5 years, and was suspected of having streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, for which he received antimicrobials, immunoglobulin therapy, debridement, and plasma exchange. The same manifestations with similar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of high signal on short tau inversion recovery showing the spread of inflammation in the fat tissue and fascia was observed twice at the age of 6 years. Serological analyses for conventional autoantibodies, bone marrow aspiration, and whole-exome sequencing examination were non-remarkable. Prednisolone was effective in ameliorating the above putative autoinflammatory syndrome. The patient was admitted at the age of 10 years with similar clinical and MRI findings indicative of recurrence of the same disease. En bloc biopsy from the skin to the fascia showed thickening of collagen fibers, infiltration of inflammatory cells composed mainly of neutrophils and lymphocytes, and necrotizing vasculitis in the fat tissue and fascia. Immunohistochemical staining of the en bloc biopsy sections indicated infiltration of T lymphocytes and macrophages in the perivascular connective tissue and fibrinoid necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of FPS.Induction therapy with prednisolone resulted in a remission. IgG purified from the patient's serum reacted with pericellular basement membranes in the subcutaneous fat tissue by immunohistochemistry. The patient is currently taking famotidine to prevent relapses and is making good progress in his recovery.
Conclusions: Although pathogenic autoantibodies have not been described in FPS, our results suggest that fat-tissue-reactive autoantibodies may be involved in the pathogenesis of FPS.

# Automatic Cervical Cross-Sectional Area Measurement in 3T MR Images: Case of Healthy Human Spinal Cord

## 3t MR图像中的自动颈椎横截面积测量: 健康人脊髓的情况

Precise measurement of Spinal Cord Cross-Sectional Area (SC-CSA) is crucial for monitoring SC health state and diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Devic Neuromyelitis Optica (DNMO), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) progression. However, accurate measurement of SC-CSA is challenging due to many factors such as SC curvature, patient positioning, segmentation methods, and the limitations of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) resolution.

Traditional methods that rely on vertebral levels as reference suffer from intersubject variability and limited reproducibility. In this study, we propose a novel landmarks-based method for automated SC-CSA measurement. The proposed approach, relying on consecutive spinal nerves&rsquo; midpoints as anatomical reference, offers more precise spinal segment delimitation and consistent SC-CSA measurements.

We validated the effectiveness and robustness of our method using two public datasets comprising MR Images of healthy individuals covering all cervical levels and for three different head positions. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed SC-CSA measurement method could be considered as a useful tool for potential clinical applications

Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCs) has been widely used in wastewater treatment due to its efficient functional groups. To boost its efficacy, a nanocomposite with two metal oxides, cerium dioxide (CeO2) and iron oxide (Fe2O3), was formed using the&amp;nbsp;ball milling technique. Two concentrations (0.15 and 0.3g) of both metal oxides were loaded to CMCs and labeled as 0.15CeO2/Fe2O3/CMCs and 0.3CeO2/Fe2O3/CMCs nanocomposite and their photocatalytic performance was compared with the blank CMCs. Upon grinding, CMCs exhibited flake-like shapes that were significantly coated with CeO2 and Fe2O3. The nanocomposites were evaluated for their photocatalytic performance by measuring the degradation of Malachite Green (MG) dye under various conditions. The 0.15CeO2/Fe2O3/CMCs nanocomposite successfully achieved complete dye degradation at a concentration of 15 mg/L after 150 min, while the 0.3CeO2/Fe2O3/CMCs seized the degradation in 120 min. The research found that 400 ppm of catalyst was the ideal catalyst dose and that a pH 6 was optimum for photocatalytic degradation.&amp;nbsp;The antibacterial activity was assessed against Gram-positive and negative&amp;nbsp;bacteria and the 0.3CeO2/Fe2O3/CMCs exhibited notable antibacterial efficacy.&amp;nbsp;The overall results reveal that CeO2/Fe2O3/CMCs nanocomposite flakes are efficient for the photocatalytic breakdown of organic dyes in wastewater emphasizing their potential for addressing environmental issues and combating microbial contamination.

# Tunable orbital Chern insulating states in crystalline Bernal-tetralayer graphene

## 晶体Bernal-四层石墨烯中的可调轨道Chern绝缘态

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5941612/latest

Multilayer graphene systems, with their rich interplay of valley and layer degrees of freedom and associated order parmeters, host a variety of topological phenomena. Recent studies have induced moir&eacute; superlattices and spin-orbit proximity effects in multilayer graphene to realize quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effects driven by orbital ferromagnetism. Here, we report the observation of a Hall resistance quantized at &plusmn;h/6e&sup2;, which persists down to 20 mT, with an anomalous Hall effect in Bernal-stacked tetralayer graphene near charge neutrality. Experimental evidence of magnetic field, electric field and carrier density tunability of a ferromagnetic order provides convincing evidence for a Chern insulating state with a Chern number of 6. A theory reveals that this arises from an electric-field-driven topological phase transition enabled by a layer antiferro-valleytric order that couples the valley and layer degrees of freedom. Our findings uncover previously unrecognized layer-valley antiferroic orders and their resulting highly tunable orbital Chern insulating states in the single crystalline material, achieved without moir&eacute; engineering or spin-orbit coupling.
