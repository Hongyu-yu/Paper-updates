# Synthesis of radical-bridged lanthanide heterobimetallic complexes

## 自由基桥联镧系杂双金属配合物的合成

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1bkrg?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Joy, Farnaby

Heteromultimetallic lanthanide (Ln) molecules are used in sensing and imaging, and have recently demonstrated Ln to-Ln energy transfer and potential as quantum logic processors. However, the selective synthesis of molecular Ln heteromultimetallics is challenging, limiting further investigation of their properties and applications. For example, redox active ligands mediate f-block reactivity with small molecules and have applications in molecular magnetics in homometallic Ln systems, yet have not been incorporated into heteromultimetallic complexes. Herein, we utilise the chemically distinct binding sites and redox chemistry of 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione (pd) to synthesise radical-bridged Ln heterobimetallic complexes. In a stepwise, modular, and extendable synthesis, we tailor the ancillary ligand environment to generate selectivity within the non-directional ionic bonding regime typical for Ln ions. The selectivity of binding for two lanthanide combinations with different ionic radius ratios is demonstrated by solution-state spectroscopy (NMR, UV-vis, photoluminescence), and confirmed in the solid-state by crystallographic determination of the molecular structures. In preliminary photoluminescence studies, we observe complex, selective energy transfer unusually involving the radical ligand. Our synthetic strategy enables any pair of lanthanide ions to be combined and will be widely applicable in the preparation of heteromultimetallic complexes of otherwise non-selective metal ions.

# Electron Sextets as Optically Addressable Molecular Qubits: Triplet Carbenes

## 电子六位组作为光学可寻址的分子量子位: 三重态卡宾

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-px2sj?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Joel, Yuen-Zhou

There is a growing demand in quantum information science and sensing for electron spin purification and readout via a spin-optical interface. This technique, known as optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), has been applied on diamond-NV centres and transition metal complexes. Metal-free counterparts of these optically addressable spin qubits promise to be cheaper, more sustainable colour centres with prolonged polarisation lifetimes. However, progress has been hindered by the low ODMR signals of carbon-based π-diradicals, partly due to the lack of a ground singlet-to-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC). In this work, we propose to explore organic systems that are even more electron-deficient: electron sextets. Using triplet carbenes as an example, we illustrate how the ground singlet-triplet gap can be widened beyond thermal energy with the associated singlet-to-triplet ISC made available by vibronic effects. Through careful molecular engineering, this ISC can occur at a rate similar to and with an opposite spin selectivity from the excited-state ISC well-established in π-diradicals, unlocking a new ODMR pathway with potential signal gains. Persistent triplet carbenes is a renascent field with multiple stable molecules being isolated in the past five years. To motivate further development of its emissive properties, we illustrate our design in two realistic carbene candidates that incorporate existing strategies for carbene stabilisation. Ultimately, we believe that a new realm of quantum materials can be uncovered by expanding our scope towards stable electron sextets.

# A Theoretical Framework for Absolute Quantification in Digital Immunoassays and the Advancements in Droplet-Based Digital Immunoassay Methodologies

## 数字免疫测定中绝对定量的理论框架和基于液滴的数字免疫测定方法的进展

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-19rj6-v4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Xiluan, Yan

Conventional single-molecule immunoassay models, which model on a single discrete Poisson distribution, are inadequate for achieving theoretical absolute quantification of target proteins. We introduce a novel approach that models the capture of target proteins by magnetic beads in digital immunoassays as a Poisson process, treating the beads as discrete units. The subsequent secondary sampling process is modeled using hypergeometric distributions. By implementing a droplet-based absolute quantification method, we establish two technical approaches, the bead-counting method and the external calibration method, that eliminate the necessity for traditional calibration curves. Comparative analyses with existing techniques, such as Single Molecule Immunoassays and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassays, demonstrate enhanced feasibility and wide digital linear range of our methods. Furthermore, we explore the feasibility of an internal calibration method. Our theoretical framework effectively addresses the critical challenge of absolute quantification in protein immunoassays. It provides essential support for the development of precise protein quantification techniques and extends the capabilities of digital immunoassays in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.

# Surface-Adaptive Anti-Biofouling Coatings Based on Amphiphilic P(OEGMA-co-AEMA) Copolymers: Synthesis, Characterization, and Performance Evaluation

**Authors:** Laura, Saa

Biofouling, the undesired accumulation of microorganisms on surfaces exposed to aqueous environments, is primarily driven by bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. It presents a significant challenge in various fields, especially in biomedical applications such as tissue engineering, wound healing, and medical devices. To develop effective antifouling solutions, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying biological attachment. For example, surface properties, such as hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance and texture, play a key role in avoiding the formation of biofilms that facilitate the incorporation of other microorganisms. While current antifouling strategies are generally effective on hydrophilic surfaces, they often exhibit reduced efficacy on hydrophobic ones due to limited surface interactions. Here, we propose the use of amphiphilic random copolymers, which combine both hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, as a promising solution for adapting to different surface types. In particular, this study explores the use of amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate-co-(2-acetoacetoxy ethyl methacrylate) (P(OEGMA-co-AEMA)) copolymers as adaptive coatings to prevent biofouling. Chemical characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) confirmed the successful synthesis of the copolymers. Additionally, their ability to form antifouling layers on both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces was evaluated using advanced techniques such as atomic force microscopy and ellipsometry. Bacterial adhesion experiments demonstrated an 80% reduction in biofouling, highlighting their potential for various biomedical applications such as medical device coatings.

# Study of evolution of three-dimensional 
porous structure in zeolite-templated carbons

## 三维演化研究
沸石模板碳中的多孔结构

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9gg7z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Rodney, Ruoff

The clogging of zeolites with carbon-containing precursors is an industrial challenge in some applications but when the deposition of carbon is deliberate and ‘works well’, a source of carbon material with intriguing properties in others. Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) are often compared to activated carbons due to their shared characteristics, such as high surface area, chemical composition, and thermal and chemical stability under various conditions. However, the key distinction lies in their controllable pore size, which makes ZTCs exceptionally interesting materials.
 Since the late 1990s, extensive research has been conducted on ZTCs, exploring different zeolite templates, carbon precursors, and synthesis parameters. Yet, despite significant progress, the field still faces unresolved questions, controversies, and aspects that have been overlooked. 
We report synthesis and characterization of three-dimensional porous carbon structures by using ion-exchanged faujasite zeolite as template. The progression of carbon networks from the initial to the final stages of growth inside zeolite channels was studied by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, gas adsorption, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance. Atomic-resolution images obtained with integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) were used to study both the zeolite and carbon structure inside the zeolite pores. 
Argon and CO2 adsorption isotherms show that the inner and the outer pore volumes (that we label V1 and V2) and surface areas (that we label S1 and S2) of the hollow carbon networks can be distinguished in the pore size distribution curves; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these pore volumes and BET surface areas have been separately determined. For this porous carbon product, V1=0.14 cm3/g and S1=500 m2/g, and V2=0.99 cm3/g and S2=1640 m2/g. The iDPC-STEM and gas adsorption studies, as a function of time of exposure to acetylene during synthesis, provide new insights into the growth of zeolite-templated carbons and thus of carbons having both “inner” (enclosing V1 and generating S1) and “outer” (enclosing V2 and generating S2) volumes and surfaces after removal of the zeolite.
