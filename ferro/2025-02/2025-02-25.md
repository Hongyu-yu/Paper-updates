Author(s): Wang Chen, Xiaoying Zhou, Wen-Kai Lou, and Kai Chang<br /><p>Altermagnetism is a magnetic phase characterized by spin-split band structures without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rotation symmetry-compensated net magnetization. Here, the authors uncover the magneto-optical properties of a <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>d</mi></math>-wave altermagnet. They demonstrate that the spin-polarized bands manifest in the anisotropic spin-resolved optical conductivity, enabling circular dichroism. In the absence (presence) of SOC, only intraband (both intraband and interband) transitions occur which satisfy the selection rule ∆n=±1 (∆n=±1,±3). This research provides valuable insights into the unique optical properties of altermagnetic materials.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRB/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevB.111.064428.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

# Effects of amino-acid functionalization and pH value on temperature-dependent water dynamics in silica confinement

## 氨基酸官能化和ph值对二氧化硅限制中温度依赖性水动力学的影响

Link: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/162/8/084702/3337031/Effects-of-amino-acid-functionalization-and-pH

<span class="paragraphSection"><sup>2</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) field-cycling relaxometry and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) studies show that water dynamics in silica pores with similar diameters (∼6 nm) strongly depend on the functionalization of the inner surfaces. In all studied confinements, we observe two prominent changes in the temperature dependence of water reorientation. Specifically, the activation energy of <span style="font-style: italic;">E</span><sub>a</sub> ∼ 0.3 eV in the fully liquid state more than triples to <span style="font-style: italic;">E</span><sub>a</sub> ∼ 1.0 eV upon partial crystallization at <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span><sub>m</sub> ∼ 258 K. Furthermore, in the partially crystallized state, the liquid fraction shows a dynamical crossover at ∼185 K, where the common low-temperature behavior of confined water with <span style="font-style: italic;">E</span><sub>a</sub> = 0.4–0.5 eV is established. However, the correlation times of water reorientation are up to two orders of magnitude longer in amino-acid functionalized silica pores than in pristine ones. Comparing the results for different functional groups, NMR and BDS consistently show that the slowdown is strongest for basic lysine followed by neutral alanine and, finally, acidic glutamic acid. Based on this order, one may speculate that the changed dynamics are a consequence of different pH values of water in confinements with different functional groups. Although pH measurements confirm that the pH value strongly depends on the amino-acid functionalization, this speculation must be rejected due to the observation that water with very different pH values does not show diverse reorientation dynamics when enclosed in identical pores.</span>

# N-doped MoS 2  nanoflowers for the ultrasonic-vibration-driven high piezoelectric catalytic degradation

<span class="paragraphSection">In this study, N-doped few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> piezocatalysts were successfully prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method with urea as a nitrogen source. Benefiting from the optimized proportion of minority layers at edge positions and higher conductivity by N doping, the optimal N-doped few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> (120 mg of added urea) sample showed the optimal piezocatalytic activity for Rhodamine B (RhB) and levofloxacin (LEV), reaching 84.6 and 73.1% with the reaction kinetic rate constant of 0.020 86 and 0.017 05 min<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. In addition, the generation of superoxide radicals (·O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>) from the 120-MoS<sub>2</sub> sample was determined to be greater than that from the 0-MoS<sub>2</sub> sample in the piezocatalyst process by free radical scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance tests. Based on experimental data, a potential mechanism has been proposed to explain the enhanced piezocatalyst performance of N-doped few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub>. This research sheds new light on the development of efficient, cost-effective MoS<sub>2</sub> piezoelectric catalysts through the doping of non-metallic dopants.</span>

# Unraveling the Mn2+ Substitution Effect on the Structural, Magnetic, and Heating Properties of MnxFe3-xO4 Magnetic Nanoparticles

## 揭开Mn2取代对MnxFe3-xO4磁性纳米颗粒的结构，磁性和加热性能的影响

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-16j7d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Maria, Moros

Composition is a key parameter to effectively tune the magnetic anisotropy of magnetic nanoparticles, which in turn can modulate their structural-magnetic properties and, thus,their final applications. The Mn2+ content of manganese ferrite nanoparticles (MnxFe3-xO4) deeply impacts their structure, magnetism, and, thus, their capacity as nanoheaters. To properly unveil how Mn2+ content influences these parameters, it is essential to synthesize monodisperse MNPs with similar sizes and shapes. Herein we report the synthesis of a wide range of MnxFe3-xO4 with x = 0.14 to 1.40, with similar polyhedral morphologies and sizes (13 to 15 nm) to exclude the crucial role that size and shape play. We demonstrate that high Mn2+ levels (x ≥ 0.70) lead to structural changes and the appearance of strain defects reflected in their poor saturation magnetization (Ms) values but, without modification of the final crystallite size. For the rest of the samples (in the range of x = 0.0 up to 0.70), average Ms values remain nearly constant despite Mn2+ levels, but the coercive field (Hc) varies significantly, indicating the critical role of composition in driving the transition of the particles towards soft magnets behaviors. As MNPs were synthesized in organic solvents, they were transferred into water using a polymer coating. Even when this step is often overlooked, water transference results in cations leaching, promoting vacancies and changes in the local ferrite structure. These changes had a minor impact on Ms values, suggesting that leaching probably affects the cations located closer to the surface. The magnetic heating capabilities were evaluated by calorimetry and AC magnetometry, finding that the heating capacity increased as the Mn2+ content increased (x ≤ 0.60). Lastly, selected MNPs (x = 0.07 and 0.60) were incubated with MIA PaCa-2 cell line for 24 h, showing an absence of cell cytotoxicity together with a high internalization rate independent of the compositions used. Our detailed analysis provides a better understanding of the effect of composition on the efficiency of heat generation and straightforward guidance for the optimized composition needed to modulate structural-magnetic properties depending on the final applications.

# Electrochemically Resolved Acoustic Emissions from Li-ion Batteries

## 电化学解析锂离子电池的声发射

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r7vwq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Martin Z., Bazant

New methods of operando non-destructive evaluation (NDE) are needed to better assess the health and safety of Li-ion batteries. Monitoring acoustic emissions (AEs) is a popular NDE method in structural engineering, but has not yet provided reliable assessments when applied to batteries. Here, we show that various electro-chemo-mechanical processes in battery electrodes (graphite and nickel-manganese-cobalt oxides, NMC) can be reproducibly identified by electrochemically resolved AEs, after eliminating electromagnetic interference and applying wavelet-based signal processing. First, we perform “acousto-voltammetry” to correlate acoustic activity with specific electrochemical processes, such as ethylene gas generation and NMC particle fracture, as confirmed by gas detection and ex-situ SEM imaging, respectively. Next, we show that AEs can be distinguished using wavelet-transform features. Electrochemically resolved AEs provide a new window into quantitatively monitoring battery degradation, offering insights into electro-chemo-mechanical processes and potential advantages over conventional methods to improve metrics for state-of-health, remaining useful life, and safety risks.

Eu(II)-containing chalcogenides are an emerging class of materials that are of high interest due to their high optical activity and intriguing magnetism. Here, we synthesized Eu2SiSe4 as red-colored single crystals and characterized its structure with single crystal X-ray diffraction, confirming the reported chiral monoclinic P21 symmetry at room temperature. The crystal structure of Eu2SiSe4 comprises distorted SiSe4 tetrahedral units and charge-balancing Eu(II) cations. We find the second harmonic generation (SHG) activity (~7x AGS) of polycrystalline Eu2SiSe4 to be among the highest known SHG active chalcogenides. No symmetry lowering is observed down to 100 K in single crystal X-ray diffraction, although an anomalous expansion in the b-axis lattice parameter occurs and may be correlated to lattice vibrations of the SiSe4 tetrahedra. We investigate the physical properties of Eu2SiSe4 and find complex temperature- and field-dependent behavior, including a weak transition at ~145 K as well as multiple magnetic transitions occurring at low temperature, leading to a slightly canted antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic ground state. The low-temperature transitions release less entropy than expected, which may be due to complex crystal electric field effects of Eu(II).

NMR is usually performed at magnetic fields of 1 T and above to obtain sufficient sensitivity and spectral dispersion to identify chemicals based on chemical shifts and J couplings. At lower fields, the advent of hyperpolarization technologies and sensitive low-field detectors can address sensitivity concerns. However, it remains disputed whether spectral signatures at low fields are sufficient for chemical identification. Here, we report an all–electron DFT batch production of J coupling NMR spectra at zero field and 6.5 mT for over 200 small molecules. We found that ultra-low-field NMR can be used for unique chemical identification. In the developed computational tool chain, we first used the all-electron FHI-aims code to calculate the molecular J couplings and chemical shifts. We then fed the calculated NMR parameters into the NMR simulation package SPINACH to simulate both heteronuclear J coupling spectra at zero-field, and spin-lock induced crossing (SLIC) spectra at 6.5 mT. The resulting spectra demonstrate that ultra-low-field NMR spectra can represent unique identifiers of chemical structure for small molecules.
