Author(s): Mattias Brynjell-Rahkola, Yohann Duguet, and Thomas Boeck<br /><p>The transition route from laminar to turbulent flow in a magnetohydrodynamic duct with a square cross-section is investigated in the limit of low magnetic Reynolds number. In the presence of a transverse magnetic field, Hartmann and Shercliff layers are present on the walls orthogonal and parallel to the field direction, respectively. Independently of the initial location of a finite perturbation in either Shercliff or Hartmann layers, transition relies on a tripping of the Shercliff layer by perturbations, while the Hartmann layer plays a passive role. This is explained, using a dynamical systems interpretation, by the spatial localization of the edge states in the Shercliff layer.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRFLUIDS/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.10.023903.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

Author(s): Amin Pishehvar, Zhaoyou Wang, Yujie Zhu, Yu Jiang, Zixin Yan, Fangxin Li, Josep M. Jornet, Jia-Mian Hu, Liang Jiang, and Xufeng Zhang<br /><p><i>Cavity magnonics</i> is crucial for advancing next-generation signal processing (both classical and quantum), but its uptake has been limited by the challenge of achieving on-demand isolation and control of magnons, due to quasistatic magnon-photon interactions. This study employs Floquet engineering, using time-periodic drives in a multimode hybrid magnonic system to dynamically darken magnon modes, effectively decoupling them from the electromagnetic environment. By tuning the relative phase and amplitudes of the drives, precise control over magnon dynamics is achieved. This approach is also scalable, opening the door to large-scale, programmable hybrid magnonic circuits.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRAPPLIED/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.23.024053.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

# Divergent Organomagnesium Reactivity of Rigid, Dinucleating Naphthyridine Ligands: Subtle Changes with Big Impact

## 刚性，双核萘啶配体的有机镁反应性不同: 细微变化，影响很大

**Authors:** Martin, Lutz

We report the synthesis and characterisation of the naphthyridine-based dippDAMN and dippNDC ligands, bearing pendant secondary amine and amide donors, respectively. We additionally report their deprotonation chemistry and reactivity with dialkylmagnesium and Grignard reagents.  The Grignard reactions yield structurally distinct LMg2Cl2·(THF)n complexes, with the dippNDC-based complex exhibiting reduced steric strain from the ligand around the Mg2Cl2 core. Comparison of the steric profiles of the LMg2Cl2·(THF)n complexes reveals that this reduced steric strain stems from the difference in binding modes of the ligands, which in the dippNDC case points the bulk of sterically demanding substituents away from the Mg2Cl2 core. Reactivity of the ligands with Mg(n-Bu)2 shows divergent outcomes: dippDAMN forms the LMg2(n-Bu)2·(THF)2 complex cleanly, whereas dippNDC produces paramagnetic species via Mg–C homolysis, triggering radical reactivity which results in ligand butylation and dimerisation. These findings underscore the unique steric and electronic features of dimagnesium complexes supported by rigid, dinucleating naphthyridine ligands, highlighting how seemingly subtle variations in ligand architecture can profoundly influence coordination chemistry and reactivity.

# Shorter, Faster, and Effective? Evaluating Abbreviated MRI for Branch-Duct Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm

## 更短、更快、更有效？评估导管内乳头状黏液性肿瘤的简化MRI

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5968545/latest

Background With the advancements in imaging technologies and the widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the detection rates of pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) have significantly increased. While most of these lesions are benign, branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) pose a potential risk for malignant transformation, necessitating regular clinical and radiological follow-up. However, conventional MRI protocols are time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting the need for shorter, cost-effective alternatives without compromising diagnostic accuracy. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical feasibility of abbreviated MRI (A-MRI) protocols for BD-IPMN surveillance compared to standard MRI (S-MRI).Methods This was a single-center, retrospective study including patients with BD-IPMN who underwent follow-up MRI between January 2022 and December 2024. Three MRI protocols were analyzed: (1) S-MRI, comprising T2-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) T1-weighted imaging, 3D MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI); (2) A-MRI protocol 1 (A-MRI-1), including MRCP and T2-weighted sequences; and (3) A-MRI protocol 2 (A-MRI-2), incorporating MRCP, T2-weighted, and DWI sequences. The images are evaluated for lesion size progression (&amp;ge;&amp;thinsp;5 mm in 2 years), mural nodules, cyst wall thickening, main pancreatic duct dilation, and parenchymal atrophy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for A-MRI protocols in detecting degeneration signs.Results A total of 124 patients (mean age: 64 years, 55.6% female) and 124 lesions were analyzed. The detection rates of key degeneration markers were similar between S-MRI and A-MRI protocols, except for contrast-enhanced mural nodules, which were not identifiable with A-MRI due to the lack of DCE sequences. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for A-MRI in detecting BD-IPMN degeneration markers were 100%, 98.3%, 71.4%, and 100%, respectively. A-MRI protocols demonstrated a comparable diagnostic performance to S-MRI while significantly reducing scan time (from ~&amp;thinsp;40&amp;ndash;50 min to 7&amp;ndash;12 min). However, false-positive mural nodule detection was higher with A-MRI, potentially leading to unnecessary follow-up imaging. The addition of DWI in A-MRI-2 did not provide a significant diagnostic advantage over A-MRI-1.Conclusions A-MRI is a viable alternative for BD-IPMN follow-up, offering substantial reductions in imaging duration and costs while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. However, the absence of DCE sequences may lead to false-positive mural nodule detection, necessitating further evaluation in selected cases.

# Distributed Wavefront Shaping in Near-Field sub-1 THz Wireless Networks

## 近场亚1 THz无线网络中的分布式波前整形

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5898192/latest

In sub-terahertz (sub-THz) wireless networks, the radiative near-field regime can no longer be ignored. Indeed, this less-explored electromagnetic regime can provide unprecedented opportunities to tackle the long-standing challenges of sub-THz wireless communication, including using focused beams to combat higher propagation losses and self-healing beams that offer enhanced resilience against line-of-sight blockage. Nevertheless, our mathematical modeling and experimental study find that such favorable near-field properties can be observed only within a smaller range of the nominal near-field Fresnel regime. When attempting to extend this range, current literature suggests adopting transmit arrays with larger form factors, which may not be available in the environment or even hard and expensive to fabricate. In this study, we present the first mathematical modeling and experimental demonstration of distributed near-field beam shaping using multiple coordinated transmitting apertures, hence, increasing the effective near-field regime. Our modeling is built on a detailed understanding of near-field electromagnetics, Fourier optics, and wave optics.

Context and Methods Palladium-based vacancy-ordered perovskites A₂PdCl₆ (A&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;K, Rb, Cs) exhibit promising structural, electronic, magnetic, and thermoelectric properties. They crystallize in an Fm3̅m symmetry, with electronic transitions dominated by Pd d- and Cl p-orbitals. Their thermoelectric efficiency depends on electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficients, and thermal conductivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using WIEN2k with the PBE functional, incorporating spin-orbit coupling where necessary. Electronic properties were analyzed via density of states (DOS) and band structure calculations. Thermoelectric properties were evaluated using Boltzmann transport theory via BoltzTraP. The figure of merit (ZT) was computed to assess thermoelectric efficiency. Magnetic properties were studied through spin-orbit coupling effects. These insights highlight the potential of A₂PdCl₆ for sustainable energy and electronic applications.

# Interlayer Valley Coupling and Hybridized Excitons in Twisted van der Waals Bilayers with Broken Translational Symmetry

## 具有破坏的平移对称性的扭曲范德华双层中的层间谷耦合和杂化激子

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5873933/latest

Twisted van der Waals (vdW) bilayers, characterized by strong moir&eacute; effects and interlayer coupling, offer a versatile platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. At large twist angles, the broken translational symmetry facilitates the alignment of intralayer and interlayer valley momenta through Umklapp scattering, enabling unique intervalley coupling. However, the experimental investigation of such couplings in twisted vdW bilayers with broken translational symmetry remains scarce. Here, we report the observation of interlayer K and &minus;K valley coupling in twisted vdW bilayers with broken translational symmetry, demonstrated by the emergence of strong photoluminescence from high-energy interlayer hybridized excitons. These excitons are absent in commensurate homobilayers and exhibit an almost negligible valley Zeeman effect, attributed to the robust hybridization between intralayer and interlayer excitons. This hybridization drives a unique magnetic-field-dependent valley polarization in excitons with distinct spin states. As temperature increases, the hybridized excitons detune, bringing their energy closer to that of intralayer excitons. These findings highlight the fundamental role of broken translational symmetry in moir&eacute; physics and open new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena in aperiodic twisted vdW materials.
