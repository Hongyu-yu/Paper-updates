Researchers at the University of Bayreuth have developed a method that makes objects on a magnetic field invisible within a particle stream. Until now, this so-called cloaking had only been studied for waves such as light or sound. They report their results in Nature Communications.

# Hypercharge breaking scenarios could explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe

## 超电荷破裂情景可以解释宇宙的重子不对称性

The Standard Model (SM), the main physics framework describing elementary particles and the forces driving them, outlines key patterns in physical interactions referred to as gauge symmetries. One of the symmetries it describes is the so-called U(1)Y hypercharge: a gauge symmetry that contributes to the electric charge of particles before electromagnetic and weak forces become distinct (i.e., before the electroweak phase transition).

# Stabilization of the Ferryl=oxoheme Form of Staphylococcus aureus IsdG by Electron Transfer from a Second-Sphere Tryptophan

## 通过第二球色氨酸的电子转移稳定金黄色葡萄球菌IsdG的Ferryl = oxoheme形式

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-8tqvn-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

**Authors:** Matthew A, Conger

The ferryl heme forms of Staphylococcus aureus IsdG and IsdI have novel UV/Vis absorption spectra that are distinct from those of the three forms of ferryl heme typically found in biological systems: compound I, compound II, and com-pound ES. In this work, the ferryl heme form of IsdG was characterized because it is an analogue for the immediate product of enzyme-catalyzed heme hydroxylation. The ferryl heme form of IsdG generated following the addition of meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to the ferric heme form of IsdG has a half-life of 4.0 ± 0.2 min, which is more than 100 times longer than the half-life for the ferryl heme form of human heme oxygenase (hHO). Magnetic circular dichroism characterization of the IsdG species yielded spectral data and zero-field splitting parameters consistent with either a compound II- or compound ES-like ferryl heme. Further characterization of isotopically-enriched samples with elec-tron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed the presence of a protein-based organic radical, as would be ex-pected for compound ES. Finally, multi-scale quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics and time-dependent density functional theory strongly suggest that the ferryl heme form of IsdG has a ruffled porphyrin ligand and an oxo ligand. Thus, the ferryl heme form of IsdG is assigned to a compound ES-like species with a Trp67-based radical. Electron transfer from Trp67 to porphyrin will stabilize the immediate product of heme hydroxylation and provide a thermodynamic driving force for the reaction. Furthermore, the ability to transfer an electron between Trp67 and the substrate may explain the differential reactivity of meso-hydroxyheme in IsdG and hHO.

# Effect of rubber particle size and content on the mechanical properties of rubber-clay mixtures solidified by EICP

## 橡胶粒径和含量对EICP固化橡胶-粘土混合物力学性能的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6052097/latest

Using the EICP technique to solidify rubber and clay mixtures as lightweight backfill is a feasible way to reduce waste tire impacts and boost rubber recycling in geotech engineering. In this study, a comprehensive laboratory investigation, including triaxial compression, oedometer, permeability, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tests, was conducted on EICP-reinforced rubber particle solidified clay (hereafter referred to as EICP-RC solidified clay) to evaluate the effects of rubber particle content and size on the mechanical behavior of the improved soil under various solidification conditions and to elucidate the solidification mechanism. The results show that although rubber particles inhibits EICP, it significantly enhances the cohesion and internal friction angle of the samples. Additionally, incorporating smaller-sized tire particles facilitated pore filling, resulting in lower compression and swelling indices and reduced permeability coefficients, making these materials suitable for use behind retaining walls and in embankment construction.

# Recovery of Au(III) from electronic waste using solid phase extraction based on a magetic nanobiocomposite, OCBS@Fe3O4 @UiO-66-SH

## 使用基于magetic纳米复合材料OCBS @ Fe3O4 @ UiO-66-SH的固相萃取从电子废物中回收Au(III)

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6054990/latest

This study created a zirconium-based MOF (UiO-66-NH2) with thiol groups attached to its magnetic corn surface for adsorption and extraction of Au(III) from electronic waste. Characterization of the composite was verified using FTIR, XRD, FESEM, TGA and BET techniques. The temperature, adsorption period, and pH on Au(III) adsorption were investigated. The pH of solutions significantly impacts Au(III) adsorption, with pH 6.0 being the optimal value. The optimum Au(III) adsorption conditions were 50 ◦C, 40 min, and 10 mg of adsorbent. Moreover, functionalized oxidized magnetic corncobs with thiol (OCBS@Fe3O4@UiO-66-SH) showed a notable ability to adsorb Au(III) with a 1587 mg/g capacity. With mass ratios of Au(III) to competing ions (Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co, Cd, and Ni) fixed at 1:1 or extended to 1:5, this adsorbent prefers Au(III) ions while showing negligible adsorption to other ions. The study validated a technique for extracting Au(III) from various electronic waste samples, achieving high recovery rates (95.30&amp;ndash;104.75%), demonstrating its effectiveness and lack of matrix interference. Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption process. Comparing models, the Langmuir model with the most excellent R2 value is best for interpreting experimental adsorption data. Among three kinetic models, pseudo-first-order (PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic, and interparticle diffusion (ID) models, PFO model exhibited a high R2 value (0.9976). Thermodynamic calculations reveal a positive &Delta;H&amp;deg;, indicating the endothermic process, and negative &Delta;G&amp;deg; values representing spontaneous adsorption at 298&amp;ndash;323 K. The positive &Delta;S&amp;deg; shows that the adsorbed molecules are more uniformly dispersed on the surface, potentially enhancing the adsorption capacity.
