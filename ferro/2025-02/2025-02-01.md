Abstract: The highly efficient torques generated by 3D topological insulators make them a favourable platform for faster and more efficient magnetic memory devices. Recently, research into harnessing orbital angular momentum in orbital torques has received significant attention. Here we study the orbital Hall effect in topological insulators. We find that the bulk states give rise to a sizeable orbital Hall effect that is up to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the spin Hall effect in topological insulators. This is partially because the orbital angular momentum that each conduction electron carries is up to an order of magnitude larger than the $\hbar/2$ carried by its spin. Our results imply that the large torques measured in topological insulator/ferromagnet devices can be further enhanced through careful engineering of the heterostructure to optimise orbital-to-spin conversion.

Abstract: Time reversal symmetry breaking is an important piece in controlling nonreciprocal responses which are crucial in advancing the utility of quantum materials in device operations. Here, we propose cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonreciprocities where time reversal breaking is achieved via chirality of the cavity modes. With twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as an example, we demonstrate the general principles of cavity control of band dispersion and geometry using chiral microwave photons which are valid for modes in a split-ring resonator or for modes emulated on a qubit lattice. In particular, we show that time reversal breaking by chiral modes enables superconducting diode-like nonlinearities in TBG by valley polarized states and their skewed quantum geometry. Strikingly, we find sizeable nonreciprocities at par with those obtained in magnetic field trained TBG Jospephson junction devices. The cavity control of superconducting nonreciprocities offers non-invasive means of exploring new functionalities in quantum circuits with in-situ implementation. This can serve as an important contribution to the toolbox for nonreciprocal models in circuit quantum electrodynamics to be harnessed for quantum computing and sensing.

Abstract: High-quality electrostatic gating is a fundamental ingredient for successful semiconducting device physics, and a key element of realizing clean quantum transport. Inspired by the widespread improvement of transport quality when two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials are gated exclusively by other vdW materials, we have developed a method for gating non-vdW materials with an all-vdW gate stack, consisting of a hexagonal boron nitride dielectric layer and a few-layer graphite gate electrode. We demonstrate this gating approach on MOVPE-grown InSb nanoribbons (NRs), a novel variant of the InSb nanowire, with a flattened cross-section. In our all-vdW gated NR devices we observe conductance features that are reproducible and have low- to near-zero gate hysteresis. We also report quantized conductance, which persists to lower magnetic fields and longer channel lengths than typical InSb nanowire devices reported to date. Additionally, we observe level splitting that is highly anisotropic in an applied magnetic field, which we attribute to the ribbon cross-section. The performance of our devices is consistent with the reduced disorder expected from the all-vdW gating scheme, and marks the first report of ballistic, few-modes quantum transport in a non-vdW material with an all-vdW gate. Our results establish all-vdW gating as a promising approach for high-quality gating of non-vdW materials for quantum transport, which is in principle applicable generically, beyond InSb systems. In addition, the work showcases the specific potential of all-vdW gate/InSb NR devices for enabling clean quantum devices that may be relevant for spintronics and topological superconductivity studies.

Abstract: Excitonic insulators represent a unique quantum phase of matter, providing a rich ground for studying exotic quantum bosonic states. Strongly coupled electron-hole bilayers, which host stable dipolar exciton fluids with an exciton density that can be adjusted electrostatically, offer an ideal platform to investigate correlated excitonic insulators. Based on electron-hole bilayers made of MoSe2/hBN/WSe2 heterostructures, here we study the behavior of excitonic insulators in a perpendicular magnetic field. We report the observation of excitonic quantum oscillations in both Coulomb drag signals and electrical resistance at low to medium magnetic fields. Under a strong magnetic field, we identify multiple quantum phase transitions between the excitonic insulator phase and the bilayer quantum Hall insulator phase. These findings underscore the interplay between the electron-hole interactions and Landau level quantization that opens new possibilities for exploring quantum phenomena in composite bosonic insulators.

Abstract: Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic properties. Among these materials, the magnetic semiconductor CrSBr is possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons, which emerges in a CrSBr flake embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second order quantum coherence. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr, and encounters a sign change depending on the antiferro- and ferromagnetic ordering. Our findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.

Abstract: The creation and control of magnetic spin textures is of great interest in fundamental research and future device-oriented applications. Fe/Gd multilayers host a rich variety of magnetic textures including topologically trivial bubbles and topologically protected skyrmions. Using time-resolved Kerr spectroscopy, we highlight how various control strategies, including temperature, out-of-plane magnetic fields and femtosecond light excitation, can be used to create such textures via different pathways. We find that varying the magnetic field for constant temperature leads to a different ($H, T$)-phase diagram of magnetic textures than moving along a temperature trajectory for constant magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations corroborate this finding and allow to visualize the different paths taken. Furthermore, we show that the creation of bubbles and skyrmions in this material via impulsive light excitation is not solely governed by temperature-driven processes, since bubbles and skyrmions can be stabilized in parts of the ($H, T$)-phase diagram, where neither the constant temperature nor the constant magnetic field trajectory predict their existence. Using this phase diagram, we reason why bubble and skyrmion creation in this particular system is only possible from the stripe domain state. Our observations provide a versatile toolkit for tailoring the creation of magnetic spin textures in Fe/Gd multilayers.

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts luminescent defects possessing spin qualities compatible with quantum sensing protocols at room temperature. Vacancies, in particular, are readily obtained via exposure to high-energy ion beams. While the defect creation mechanism via such irradiation is well understood, the occurrence rate of optically active negatively charged vacancies ($V_B^-$) is an open question. In this work, we exploit focused helium ions to systematically generate optically active vacancy defects in hBN flakes at varying density. By comparing the density-dependent spin splitting measured by magnetic resonance to calculations based on a microscopic charge model, in which we introduce a correction term due to a constant background charge, we are able to quantify the number of $V_B^-$ defects generated by the ion irradiation. We find that only a small fraction (0.2%) of all vacancies is in the optically active, negatively charged state. Our results provide a protocol for measuring the generation efficiency of $V_B^-$, which is necessary for understanding and optimizing luminescent centers in hBN.

Abstract: Here we present a theory of mirror-symmetric magic angle twisted trilayer graphene. The electronic properties are described by a Hubbard model with long range tunneling matrix elements. The electronic properties are obtained by solving the mean field Hubbard model. We obtain the bandstructure with characteristic flat bands and a Dirac cone. At charge neutrality, turning on electron-electron interactions results in metallic to antiferomagnetic phase transition, for Hubbard interaction strength considerably smaller than in other graphene multilayers. We analyze the stability of the antiferromagnetic state against the symmetry breaking induced by hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation, and mirror symmetry breaking caused by the application of electric fields that mix the Dirac cone with the flat bands. Additionally, we explore the topological properties of the system, revealing a hidden quantum geometry. Despite the flat bands having zero Chern numbers, the multiband Berry curvature distribution over the moir\'e Brillouin zone exhibits a non-trivial structure. Finally, we propose a mechanism to tune this quantum geometry, providing a pathway to control the system's topological properties.

arXiv:2501.18569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2d ferromagnetic Ising model was solved by Onsager on the square lattice in 1944, and an explicit expression of the free energy density $f$ is presently available for some other planar lattices. An exact derivation of the critical temperature $T_c$ only requires a partial derivation of $f$ and has been performed on many lattices, including the 11 Archimedean lattices. We give general expressions of the free energy, energy, entropy and specific heat for planar lattices with a single type of non-crossing links. The specific heat exhibits a logarithmic singularity at $T_c$: $c_V(T)\sim -A\ln|1-T_c/T|$, in all the ferromagnetic and some antiferromagnetic cases. While the non-universal weight $A$ of the leading term has often been evaluated, this is not the case for the sub-leading order term $B$ such that $c_V(T)+A\ln|1-T_c/T|\sim B$, despite its strong impact on $c_V(T)$ values in the vicinity of $T_c$, particularly important in experimental measurements. Explicit values of these thermodynamic quantities and of $A$ and $B$ are given for the Archimedean lattices and their dual for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions.

Abstract: String breaking is an intriguing phenomenon crucial to the understanding of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), with strong relevance to both condensed matter and high-energy physics (HEP). Recent experiments investigating string breaking in $2+1$D (two spatial and one temporal dimensions) LGTs motivate a thorough analysis of its underlying mechanisms. Here, we perform matrix product state (MPS) simulations of string breaking in an experimentally relevant $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT in the presence of two external charges. We provide a detailed description of the system in the confined phase, highlight a number of mechanisms which are responsible for string breaking, and argue that magnetic fluctuations have a stabilizing effect on the strings. Moreover, we show that deep in the confined regime the problem is dual to one-dimensional free fermions hopping on an open chain. Our work elucidates the microscopic processes of string breaking in $2+1$D LGTs, and our findings can be probed on current superconducting-qubit quantum computers.

arXiv:2501.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model (on a square lattice) at zero temperature in Hartree-Fock theory. It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U>0$ and $t>0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.

# Non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics in isolated quantum many-body systems

**Authors:** Aditya Banerjee

arXiv:2501.18476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is believed that an isolated quantum many-body system far away from equilibrium should try to attain equilibrium via a mechanism whereby any given subsystem acts as an open quantum system that is coupled to an environment which is the complementary part of the full system and undergoing a complicated equilibration process such that all the subsystems in the long-time limit attain equilibrium states compatible with the global equilibrium state. This picture begs the question whether the dynamics of any given subsystem is Markovian (monotonic loss of information and memory) or non-Markovian. In this work, by numerically probing the dynamical behaviour of the distance between \textit{temporally-separated} subsystem states, we reveal the telltale signatures and other associated features of quantum (non-)Markovianity of the dynamics of small subsystems of an isolated quantum spin system in one dimension (the Ising spin chain) brought far from equilibrium by quantum quenches. Additionally, remarkably systematic behaviour is seen in the dynamics of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of the subsystems. These features strongly depend on the direction of quenching in the parameter space, with paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic quenches offering considerably stronger signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity, for which we offer heuristic arguments.

Abstract: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.

arXiv:2501.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a singlet-only always-on gapless exchange (SAGE) spin qubit that encodes a single qubit in the spins of four electrons while allowing universal baseband control. While conventional exchange-only qubits suffer from magnetic-field-gradient-induced leakage and coherent errors, for instance due to local nuclear environments and variations in the $g$-factor, the SAGE qubit subspace is protected from coherent errors due to local magnetic field gradients and leakage out of the computational subspace is energetically suppressed due to the exchange interactions between electrons being always-on. Consequently, we find that when magnetic gradient noise dominates over charge noise, coherence times and single-qubit gate infidelities of the SAGE qubit improve by an order of magnitude compared to conventional exchange-only qubits. Moreover, using realistic parameters, two-qubit gates can be performed with a single interqubit exchange pulse with times comparable in duration to conventional exchange-only qubits but with a significantly simplified pulse sequence.

Abstract: Two common difficulties in the design of topological quantum materials are that the desired features lie too far from the Fermi level and are spread over a too-large energy range. Doping-induced states at the Fermi level provide a solution, where nontrivial topological properties are enforced by the doping-reduced symmetry. To show this, we consider a regular placement of dopants in a lattice of space group (SG) 176 ($P6\text{}_3/m$), which reduces the symmetry to SG 143 ($P3$). Our two- and four-band models feature double Weyl points, Chern bands, Van Hove singularities, nontrivial multiband quantum geometry due to mixed orbital character, and singular flat bands. We relate these features to density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for dopant and vacancy bands of lead apatite Pb$_{10}($PO$_4)_6$O and Pb$_{10}($PO$_4)_6($OH$)_2$, the van der Waals ferromagnet Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, the semiconductor SiC, and the 2D dichalcogenide MoS$_2$.

Abstract: Correlated topological materials often maintain a delicate balance among physical symmetries: many topological orders are symmetry protected, while most correlated phenomena arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is rare to find cases where symmetry breaking induces a non-trivial topological phase. Here, we present the discovery of such a phase in Ta2Pd3Te5, where Coulomb interactions form excitons, which condense below 100 K, opening a topological gap and creating a topological excitonic insulator. Our spectroscopy reveals the full spectral bulk gap stemming from exciton condensation. This excitonic insulator state spontaneously breaks mirror symmetries but involves a very weak structural coupling, as indicated by photoemission spectroscopy, thermodynamic measurements, and a detailed structural analysis. Notably, scanning tunneling microscopy uncovers gapless boundary modes in the bulk insulating phase. Their magnetic field response, together with theoretical modeling, suggests a topological origin. These observations establish Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first confirmed topological excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional crystal. This allows to access the associated physics through bulk-sensitive techniques. Furthermore, we uncover another surprising aspect of the topological excitonic insulator, a secondary excitonic instability near 5 K that breaks the translational symmetry. The wavevector of this state shows an unprecedented magnetic field tunability. Thus, we unveil a unique sequence of topological exciton condensations in a bulk crystal, offering new opportunities to study critical behavior and excitations.

Abstract: Nonlinear transports (NLTs) have garnered broad attention based on their topological origin in quantum geometry. When quantum geometry meets magnetic geometry in magnets, their crossover excites diverse phenomena particularly related to antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, very few material platforms have been predicted and experimentally verified to date, where the material pool was subconsciously narrowed down due to the demand for spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Therefore, to boost antiferromagnetic spintronics, we consider the magnetic order induced quantum geometry and corresponding NLTs in antiferromagnets (AFMs). By integrating the state-of-the-art spin space group theory into the symmetry analysis, we find that collinear and coplanar magnetic geometry can only induce NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and noncoplanar one may trigger NLT driven by dipoles of Berry curvature, inverse mass, and quantum metric. Remarkably, a materials database of 260 AFMs with SOC-free NLT effects is established. Several prototypical material candidates are presented by first-principles calculations, including collinear AFM VNb$_3$S$_6$ with NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and a room-temperature noncoplanar AFM CrSe with NLTs driven by quantum metric dipole. Our work not only provides a universal theoretical framework for studying various magnetism-driven transport effects, but also predicts broad, experimentally accessible material platforms for antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Abstract: The back-action damping of mechanical motion by electromagnetic radiation is typically overwhelmed by internal loss channels unless demanding experimental ingredients such as superconducting resonators, high-quality optical cavities, or large magnetic fields are employed. Here we demonstrate the first room temperature, cavity-free, all-electric device where back-action damping exceeds internal loss, enabled by a mechanically compliant parallel-plate capacitor with a nanoscale plate separation and an aspect ratio exceeding 1,000. The device has four orders of magnitude lower insertion loss than a comparable commercial quartz crystal and achieves a position imprecision rivaling optical interferometers. With the help of a back-action isolation scheme, we observe radiative cooling of mechanical motion by a remote cryogenic load. This work provides a technologically accessible route to high-precision sensing, transduction, and signal processing.

Abstract: Evaluations of the orbital Hall effect (OHE) have only retained inter-band matrix elements of the position operator. Here we evaluate the OHE including all matrix elements of the position operator, including the technically challenging intra-band elements. We recover previous results and find quantum corrections due to the non-commutativity of the position and velocity operators and inter-band matrix elements of the orbital angular momentum. The quantum corrections dominate the OHE responses of the topological antiferromagnet CuMnAs and of massive Dirac fermions.

Abstract: Ferroelectrics are widely used for a broad array of technological applications due to their attractive electrical and electromechanical properties. In order to obtain large functional properties, material compositions are often designed to favor a coexistence of multiple ferroelectric phases. For such compositions, the macroscopically observed properties are variously attributed to easier domain switching and/or phase transition. Nevertheless, modelling of concurrent domain switching and phase transition in mixed phase ferroelectrics remains a challenging task. Here, a methodology is presented to quantitatively evaluate the volume fractions of different domain variants in a mixed phase ferroelectric under complex electromechanical loading. The methodology combines the phenomenology of Landau free energy of ferroelectric phases with Boltzmann statistical analysis, and is presented for Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 near morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). It is shown that specific grain orientation has a significant effect on how proximity to phase boundary affects microscopic phenomena at the single-crystal level. An estimate of phase and domain switching behavior in a polycrystalline aggregate is subsequently obtained, and the resultant polarization and strain responses at the macroscopic level are computed for a material with random texture. The results indicate the progressive evolution of domain and phase fractions in a material near MPB with mixed ferroelectric phases. We show that in polycrystalline materials with compositions slightly on the tetragonal side of MPB, grains that exhibit large 90 domain switching have a larger contribution to the macroscopic strain response as compared to grains that undergo tetragonal-to-rhombohedral phase-switching.

Abstract: We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the bias current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is formulated under the bias current using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. The bias current shifts the Fermi momentum in the Rashba system due to the continuity of the electronic current. Including the shift of Fermi momentum in the coupling energy, it is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device.

Abstract: A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the anti-ferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, electrical transport, and magnetic properties of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ ($\it{x}$ = 1.14, 1.18, 1.23, 1.28, and 1.32) to unravel the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition observed in these systems. For this, we systematically evaluated the structural parameters of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ as a function of Se concentration and temperature. We observe increased lattice constants and cell volume with increased Se concentration. On the other hand, the temperature-dependent XRD studies suggest unusual lattice change around the metal-insulator (MI) transition temperature of the respective compositions. This remarkable observation suggests that the anomalous lattice effect originates the MI transition in these systems. Additionally, our density of states (DOS) calculations on FeSe$_{1.14}$ qualitatively explain the MI transition, as the low-temperature (50 K) structure DOS suggests a metallic nature and the high-temperature (300 K) structure DOS shows a gap near the Fermi level.

Abstract: The vibrational modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ easily induce octahedral rotations without tilting. Being on the verge of a magnetic instability, such propensity of octahedral rotation may also produce magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we analyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral rotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective $g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$ tight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is primarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital hybridizations between the ${\gamma}z$ ($\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much longer range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a strong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the $xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be used to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground state for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer hopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in a $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include relativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism. Finally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the intrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and intraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave or $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.

Abstract: This study presents a novel discretely dielectric material-coated (DDMC) dipole antenna design for ultra-high-field (UHF) MRI applications. This design improves frequency tuning, lowers electric field intensity, and reduces SAR by including discrete high-permittivity dielectric coatings at both ends of the dipole. The DDMC dipole's performance was compared to that of a fractionated dipole design using metrics such as inter-element coupling, B1 field distribution, and SNR. Simulations and experimental results showed that the DDMC dipole provided superior B1 field uniformity with significantly reduced B1 variation along the dipole conductor while reducing SAR, making it a safer and more efficient option for MR signal excitation and reception in UHF MR imaging. Furthermore, with its improved electromagnetic decoupling performance, the multichannel array made from the proposed DDMC dipoles shows promise for improving parallel imaging and imaging quality in UHF MRI, with future work focusing on material optimization and scalability for multi-channel arrays.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function (PNGF) method, a new approach for rapid inverse design of electromagnetic devices. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. When used with the direct binary search optimization algorithm, a low-rank update technique is leveraged to further decrease the iteration time to seconds without approximations or compromises in accuracy. The total runtime for an inverse design is reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional Maxwell solvers due to the linear time complexity of the method, attaining speedups of up to 700x for the design examples considered and lowering the process from multiple days to weeks down to less than an hour. The performance and flexibility of the approach are highlighted with design studies, including experimental results, on an ultrawideband 30GHz substrate antenna with 50% fractional bandwidth, a 6GHz switched beam antenna steerable between angles 90{\deg} apart, and a broadband, ultra-short-length microstrip to substrate-integrated waveguide transition. The approach stands to reshape inverse design in electromagnetics.

Abstract: We apply topological methods to better understand how the magnetic field in the stellarator edge can be diverted away from the confined region. Our primary method is calculating the winding numbers of closed contours, which gives information on the number and nature of fixed points within a bounded region. We first apply this to the non-resonant divertor (NRD) Hamiltonian system, and present a simple explanation for the system's diversion: trajectories are guided away from the confined region by X-points which are "unpaired" i.e. do not have corresponding O-points and therefore do not resemble an island chain. We show how similar phenomena can occur in a similar, axisymmetric Hamiltonian system. Secondly, we find examples of neoclassically optimised stellarators in the QUASR database which divert the magnetic field via unpaired X-points. We present and discuss three examples, each containing novel phenomena which might be desirable for stellarator divertors. These findings broaden the horizons of how magnetic fields can be diverted in realistic stellarators, and may be attractive for future experiments and stellarator reactor design.

Abstract: We study vorticity production in isothermal, subsonic, acoustic (nonvortical), decaying turbulence due to the presence of magnetic fields. Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we always find that the resulting turbulent kinetic energy cascade follows the ordinary Kolmogorov phenomenology involving a constant spectral energy flux. For acoustic turbulence, the corresponding nondimensional prefactor is larger than the standard Kolmogorov constant due to an inefficiency in dissipating kinetic energy. We find that the Lorentz force can not only drive the direct production of vortical motions, but it can also facilitate the conversion of acoustic energy into vortical energy. This conversion is shown to be quadratic in the magnetic field strength and linear in the acoustic flow speed. By contrast, the direct production of vortical motions by the magnetic field is linear in the field strength. Our results suggest that magnetic fields play a crucial role in vorticity production in cosmological flows, particularly in scenarios where significant acoustic turbulence is prevalent. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the early universe, where magnetic fields may convert acoustic turbulence generated during cosmological phase transitions into vortical turbulence.

Abstract: We present the first experimental measurements of the toroidal mode number of shear Alfv\'en waves in the TJ-II stellarator. A series of experiments were carried out in three different magnetic configurations to investigate counter-NBI driven modes. Co- and counter- electron-cyclotron current drive was used to modify the rotational transform ($\iota/2\pi$) profile leading to the destabilization of a varied set of Alfv\'en eigenmodes with different frequencies and mode numbers. To characterize the spatial structure of the modes we have used two Mirnov probe arrays, one dedicated to the measurement of the poloidal mode number and the other, a recently commissioned helical tri-axial array, dedicated to the measurement of the toroidal mode number. A heavy ion beam probe, operated in radial sweep mode, was employed to characterize the radial location of the modes. We show that the induced changes in $\iota/2\pi$, that are fundamental when it comes to validation studies, cannot be measured experimentally with motional Stark effect so, instead, the shielding current diffusion equation is solved in cylindrical geometry to estimate these changes. We calculate the incompressible shear Alfv\'en continuum for selected cases using \texttt{STELLGAP} and find reasonable consistency with observations. A database with the observed modes has been created, so that it can be used in future work for theory validation purposes.

Abstract: We present our implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code LaRe3D. This implementation couples a characteristics-based boundary condition with a Lagrangian remap code, demonstrating the generality and flexibility of such non-reflecting boundary conditions for use with arbitrary grid-based MHD schemes. To test this implementation for perturbations on a background state, we present simulations of a hot sphere in an angled magnetic field. We then examine a series of simulations where we advect a spheromak through a non-reflecting boundary condition at four speeds related to the fast and slow magnetosonic speeds and the Alfven speed. We compare the behavior of these simulations to ground truth simulations run from the same initial condition on an extended grid that keeps the spheromak in the simulation volume at all times. We find that the non-reflecting boundary condition can lead to severe, physical differences developing between a simulation using a non-reflecting boundary and a ground truth simulation using a larger simulation volume. We conclude by discussing the origins of these differences.

Abstract: Spin engineering of advanced pulse sequences has had a transformative impact on the development of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, to an extending degree also electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and the hybrid between the two, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Based on a simple formalism, we demonstrate that (i) single-crystal static-sample optimisations may tremendously ease design of experiments for rotating powders and (ii) pulse sequences may readily be exchanged between these distinct spectroscopies. Specifically, we design broadband heteronuclear solid-state NMR magic-angle-spinning (MAS) dipolar recoupling experiments based on the recently developed PLATO (PoLarizAtion Transfer via non-linear Optimization) microwave (MW) pulse sequence optimized on a single crystal for powder static-sample DNP. Using this concept, we demonstrate design of ultra-broadband 13C-15N and 2H-13C cross-polarization experiments, using PLATO on the 13C radio-frequency (RF) channel and square/ramped or RESPIRATION (Rotor Echo Short Pulse IRrAdiaTION) RF irradiation on the 15N and 2H RF channels, respectively.

Abstract: Conformational dynamics is crucial for ribonucleic acid (RNA) function. Techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance, cryo-electron microscopy, small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, chemical probing, single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer or even thermal or mechanical denaturation experiments probe RNA dynamics at different time and space resolutions. Their combination with accurate atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations paves the way for quantitative and detailed studies of RNA dynamics. First, experiments provide a quantitative validation tool for MD simulations. Second, available data can be used to refine simulated structural ensembles to match experiments. Finally, comparison with experiments allows for improving MD force fields that are transferable to new systems for which data is not available. Here we review the recent literature and provide our perspective on this field.

Given the urgent need to develop new methods of CO2/CO utilization, understanding the mechanism of acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) – a primordial nickel enzyme that converts these gases into a source of cellular energy, is crucial; however, conflicting hypotheses and a dearth of well-characterized bioorganometallic intermediates have hindered a proper understanding of its mechanism. Herein, we report a functional model system that supports several organometallic intermediates proposed for ACS, including the long sought-after Ni(methyl)(CO) species, and promotes all key reaction steps during catalysis: methylation, carbonylation, and thiolysis. Our investigations provide key mechanistic insights that are directly relevant to ACS, suggesting that binding of a second CO molecule to the Ni center promotes migratory insertion, that one-electron oxidation of Ni drives a fast reductive elimination, that both paramagnetic and diamagnetic Ni intermediates are involved, and confirm the feasibility of a random binding order of the methyl and CO groups to the Ni center.

Nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have emerged as a powerful strategy to construct complex molecules. A salient feature of Ni catalysts is their ability to engage in one-electron chemistry involving paramagnetic Ni(I) and Ni(III) intermediates, which has led to development of cross-coupling reactions involving alkyl substrates; however, such reactions generally employ Ni(II) or Ni(0) complexes as pre-catalysts. Although highly desirable, well-defined and catalytically competent Ni(I) sources with exchangeable ancillary ligands are lacking. Here we report the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity of a family of thermally stable dinuclear Ni(I) complexes supported by commercially available isocyanides as a general solution to this problem. Two classes of Ni(I) isocyanide complexes showing high thermal and solid-state stability have been developed – coordinatively saturated homoleptic compounds and coordinatively unsaturated Ni(I)-halide compounds. The Ni(I) compounds exhibit rapid ligand substitution and are efficient catalysts in Kumada, Suzuki-Miyaura, and Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reactions, suggesting their potential use as either Ni(I) catalysts or pre-catalysts. In addition, bromide-selective functionalization of polyhalogenated arenes with Grignard reagents was achieved for the first time under nickel catalysis. Finally, spectroscopic and mechanistic studies were performed to establish the general use of simple isocyanide ligands as spectator ligands for cross-coupling reactions, representing an untapped chemical space for new reaction discovery.

The molecular Berry curvature plays an important role for electronic structure calculations within the adiabatic Born– Oppenheimer approximation and is connected to many magnetic phenomena such as the Aharanov–Bohm and the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. For molecules in external magnetic fields, the Berry curvature is essential to achieve a qualitatively correct description of nuclear motion. Here, it is responsible for screening the Lorentz forces acting on moving nuclear charges. This connection has recently been exploited to derive a new type of population analysis known as Berry charges. In this work, we derive a novel sum rule for the molecular Berry curvature. This pseudomomentum-translational sum rule is then used to reveal the connection between Berry charges and the well-known generalized atomic polar tensor (GAPT) charges. Furthermore, we present an efficient integral-direct implementation of the molecular Berry curvature for molecules in finite magnetic fields into the TURBOMOLE program suite. This is used to further demonstrate the connection between Berry and GAPT charges for a variety of larger molecules, comparing the results to other established types of partial charges.

**Authors:** Eszter, Boros

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used diagnostic tool, yet it exhibits inherent low sensitivity that necessitates the use of contrast agents to improve the quality of MRI scans. Gadolinium-based contrast agents, and more recently manganese-based agents, have been used in pre-clinical and clinical applications due to their relaxation properties. Herein, we report a series of chelators based on the 2,11-diaza[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane macrocycle, which was chosen since its rigidity was hypothesized to favorably enhance the relaxivity of the Mn2+ complexes. The synthesized chelators were used to probe the effect of coordination number and choice of pendant arms on the efficiency of the corresponding Mn MRI contrast agents, and two lead compounds, [Mn(TE-1)]+ and [Mn(TE-4)], were identified. [Mn(TE-1)]+ has a relaxivity of 3.6 mM-1 s-1 (1.4 T, 33 ºC), comparing well to clinically established Gd-based contrast agents. By employing the 52Mn radioisotope, a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, in vivo PET imaging experiments, along with T1-weighted MRI studies, reveal that [Mn(TE-4)] shows rapid clearance with significant contrast enhancement in the kidney and bladder, indicating primarily renal clearance. By comparison, the lipophilicity of [Mn(TE-1)]+ promotes a mixed, biliary-renal excretion. Importantly, both compounds show no appreciable degradation in urine metabolites. Overall, the in vivo performance of [Mn(TE-4)] lends promise to its potential development either as an MRI contrast agent or PET imaging agent. The hepatobiliary clearance of [Mn(TE-1)]+ provides opportunities for blood pool imaging via MRI, with low-temperature radiolabeling conditions compatible with a range of biologics and potential use for immuno-PET imaging.

Understanding fundamental aspects related to the adsorption behaviour of flexible metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a crucial step to develop improved sorbents for gas separations. F4_MIL-140A(Ce) is a recently discovered MOF that displays a cooperative CO2 adsorption mechanism enabled by concerted rotation of the aromatic rings of the tetrafluoroterephthalate linkers, giving rise to a step-shaped isotherm. Here, we shed light on the key role played by the degree of fluorination of the organic linker in such a cooperative mechanism by synthesising novel Fx_MIL-140A(Ce) (where x = 2 or 3) analogues and characterising them with a wide range of experimental techniques, including powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas sorption analysis, in situ infrared spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry. We found that the removal of fluorine atoms from the linker switches off the cooperative mechanism observed in the perfluorinated prototype, leading to Langmuir-type CO2 adsorption isotherms for Fx_MIL-140A(Ce). The removal of fluorine also results in a higher CH4 adsorption capacity and, therefore, in a progressive decrease of CO2/CH4 selectivity. In situ infrared spectroscopy using CO as a probe confirmed that CeIV sites are accessible in Fx_MIL-140A(Ce), but their Lewis acidity decreases at lower degrees of fluorination. Adsorption microcalorimetry revealed that the CeIV sites are accessible to CO2 even at low loading and that a higher degree of fluorination leads to a stronger interaction with CO2. Desorption of the crystallisation water coordinated to CeIV from Fx_MIL-140A(Ce) appears to induce a similar phase transition to that observed in F4_MIL-140A(Ce), suggesting that a cooperative mechanism persists when water is the adsorbate, likely because of its ability to establish hydrogen-bonding like interactions with the linker. The collective evidence points towards reduced steric hindrance around the most favourable adsorption sites for CO2 as the main factor responsible for the absence of a cooperative adsorption mechanism in Fx_MIL-140A(Ce) MOFs.

Palladium coordination complexes are invaluable catalysts in organometallic reactions, facilitating a plethora of synthetically useful organic transformations that include C-H functionalization and C-C/C-heteroatom bond formation reactions. The proposed mechanisms for such reactions usually invoke two-electron pathways involving diamagnetic Pd0, PdII, and PdIV intermediates. However, recent research has focused on the viability of paramagnetic Pd species with +1 and +3 oxidation states as plausible intermediates. The past two decades have seen a renewed interest in the isolation and characterization of such transient species to obtain a better understanding of their structure and reactivity. This review focuses on the coordination chemistry of mononuclear PdI and PdIII compounds that have been isolated and characterized using spectroscopic techniques such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), single crystal X-ray crystallography (SC-XRD), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) methods. It is expected that the knowledge gained from studying the electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of these compounds will be used to facilitate new modes of reactivity inaccessible to traditional Pd0/II/IV chemistry.

Spin-crossover (SCO) molecular-based switches displaying magnetic bistability have shown promise across a range of applications since their discovery, including sensors, memory storage devices, actuators, or displays. Yet, limited processability remains a substantial barrier to their real-world implementation. Efforts to overcome this limitation by integrating SCO materials into polymer matrices have often been constrained by complex, costly, and time-consuming multi-step methods, which tend to produce inhomogeneous particle distributions within the matrix. Herein, we demonstrate how three-dimensional (3D) flow-focusing chemistry provides unprecedented control for the direct fabrication of SCO composite materials, effectively addressing key challenges in processability, scalability, and cost. By using a continuous 3D coaxial flow-focusing microfluidic device, we simultaneously synthesize [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) and achieve its homogeneous incorporation into alginate fibers in a seamless continuous manner. The versatility of the microfluidic device allows for precise manipulation of the reaction-diffusion (RD) zone, resulting in SCO composite fibers with tunable physicochemical and magnetic properties. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to isolate these fibers as freestanding architectures and highlight the potential for printing them with defined shapes. Finally, we show that the 3D control of the RD zone granted by continuous flow microfluidic devices offers precise spatiotemporal control over the distribution of SCO complexes within the fibers, effectively encoding SCO materials into them. SCO-encoded fibers can seamlessly combine adaptability and functionality, offering innovative solutions for application-specific customization.

# Real-time and High-speed Talkative Power Converter Based on Waveform Modulation

## 基于波形调制的实时高速健谈功率变换器

An efficient isolated DC-DC converter requires an information link between the isolated sides for power regulation and performance optimization. Talkative power converter (TPC) technology offers a cost-effective communication solution. However, the signal in existing technologies is susceptible to power noise. Consequently, the existing TPC method requires several switching cycles to transmit a single signal, and the data rate is constrained by noise, making it challenging to meet the demands of advanced communication. In this paper, a faster TPC method is proposed, using M-ary modulation based on amplitude shift keying (ASK). The nature of the magnetic tank is similar to the traditional resonant circuit, which is used to select signal frequency. It enables the signal to transmit by a frequency far above the switching frequency, thus improving the anti-noise ability. Compared to traditional communication methods, this approach eliminates the additional multipliers, enhancing integration and offering valuable insights for digital signal modulation. Thanks to the high signal strength and anti-noise ability, information transmission and demodulation can be completed within a single cycle. This method achieves the highest per-cycle transmission rate among state-of-the-art TPC techniques. The proposed method is validated on a 30kHz, 1kW, 200V dual-active-bridge prototype.

# Hyperpolarized [1- 13 C]pyruvate NMR spectroscopy reveals transition of tumor energy metabolism in tiny multicellular spheroids

## 超极化 [1-13 C] 丙酮酸NMR光谱揭示了微小多细胞球体中肿瘤能量代谢的转变

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5900705/latest

Hyperpolarized (HP) [1-13C]pyruvate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate tumor energy metabolism in tiny multicellular spheroids, serving as a model of early-phase tumorigenesis in vivo. A three-dimensional static culture of murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) cells formed uniform smaller multicellular spheroids (~&amp;thinsp;150 &amp;micro;m in diameter), without hypoxic or necrotic cores, yet these spheroids exhibited resistance to anti-tumor drugs. HP [1-13C]pyruvate NMR spectroscopy of SCCVII spheroids revealed an increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate compared to monolayer cultures, indicating enhanced aerobic glycolysis in the aggregated cells. Additionally, HP spectroscopy differentiated the degree of aerobic glycolysis in human prostate tumor spheroids―DU145 (~&amp;thinsp;120 &amp;micro;m) and PC-3 (~&amp;thinsp;230 &amp;micro;m)―as evidenced by the upregulation of genes associated with lactate production and cellular transport. The Lac/Pyr ratio among spheroids correlated with those observed in biopsy samples of corresponding malignant tumors grown in mice. These findings suggest that HP [1-13C]pyruvate NMR spectroscopy may serve as a metabolic biomarker for early-phase tumorigenesis in vivo.

# &ldquo;Regeneration-Repair-Strengthening&rdquo; mechanism in the oxidation film damage region of copper-nickel alloys under magnetic field effects

## 磁场效应下铜镍合金氧化膜损伤区域的 “再生-修复-强化” 机制

Copper-nickel alloy pipes in marine environments are prone to scouring by solid particles, which disrupt the bilayer oxidation film and induce scratches. These scratched regions are more vulnerable to perforation, potentially leading to premature pipe failure. Thus, rapidly repairing the film and restoring its corrosion resistance is a major challenge. This study simulates the "film damage-regeneration" process of copper-nickel alloys in marine environments, researching the regeneration of the film in scratched regions of a 70/30 Cu-Ni alloy in a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, under both non-magnetic and magnetic field conditions. The results demonstrate that the application of a magnetic field accelerates the regeneration of the film and, through synergistic interactions with the scratched microregions, alters the local pH conditions, suppresses the re-deposition of CuO, and significantly enhances the enrichment of NiO on the surface of the regenerated film. Ultimately, a unique single-layer film structure with enhanced corrosion resistance is formed. Notably, this single-layer film structure represents the first reported observation in copper-nickel alloy studies. This work offers a novel approach for in-situ copper-nickel alloy pipeline's film repair, with significant implications for extending the lifespan of marine engineering infrastructures.
