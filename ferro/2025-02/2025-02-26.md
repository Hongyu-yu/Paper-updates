Researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have invented an entirely new field of microscopy called nuclear spin microscopy. The team can visualize magnetic signals of nuclear magnetic resonance with a microscope. Quantum sensors convert the signals into light, enabling extremely high-resolution optical imaging.

Dark matter is an elusive type of matter that does not emit, absorb or reflect light and is thus impossible to detect using conventional techniques employed in particle physics. In recent years, groups of physicists worldwide have been trying to observe this matter indirectly using advanced detectors and equipment, by detecting signals other than electromagnetic radiation that could be linked to its activity or interactions with other matter.

# From predictors and SHAKE toward unified integration scheme for molecular dynamics

## 从预测因子和摇动到分子动力学的统一整合方案

Link: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/162/8/084103/3337070/From-predictors-and-SHAKE-toward-unified

<span class="paragraphSection">Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations applied to various special tasks such as thermostats, barostats, external volume control, or external magnetic fields often require tailored integration methods, complicating software development. Here, we propose a unified integration scheme for solving the common sets of equations of motion in MD. To achieve this, we adapted the traditional SHAKE method for treating rigid bonds to a predictor–corrector integration scheme and combined it with the existing time-reversible velocity predictor and box predictor. This new approach enables using both the time-honored Verlet method and the recently improved Gear methods. The resulting unified integration scheme was tested on two simple models and two MD systems: SPC/E water and ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoridoborate). Trajectories in microcanonical, Nosé–Hoover canonical, and MTK isobaric ensembles were generated. The results for Verlet-based methods were in excellent agreement with those obtained using conventional integration methods. For particular tasks, the use of higher-order methods can be beneficial. Overall, in comparison with standard approaches, our universal scheme provides a significantly simpler route to devising new integrators and maintaining existing simulation software. Furthermore, our family of new integrators can be efficiently deployed in massively parallel MD software.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection">Transient electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy has been used to probe photoinduced electron spin polarization in the recovered ground states of four radical-elaborated (CAT)Pt(bpy) donor-acceptor complexes (CAT = catechol; bpy = 4,4′-di-<span style="font-style: italic;">tert</span>-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine). These complexes are comprised of one or two S = 1/2 nitronyl nitroxide radicals attached through different phenylethynyl bridges to the 3- or 3,6 positions of the CAT donor. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of substitution patterns on the magnitude of the TREPR signal, thereby guiding future design principles for generating and understanding the origin of photoinduced electron spin polarization in these and related chromophores.</span>

# Application of the noncollinear Scalmani–Frisch formalism to current density functional theory

## 非共线的scalmani-frisch形式主义在电流密度泛函理论中的应用

Link: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/162/8/084104/3337060/Application-of-the-noncollinear-Scalmani-Frisch

<span class="paragraphSection">We generalize the noncollinear formalism proposed by Scalmani and Frisch [J. Chem. Theory Comput. <strong>8</strong>, 2193 (2012)] to include the particle and spin current densities for <span style="font-style: italic;">meta</span>-generalized gradient approximations and local hybrid functionals. This allows us to fully include the impact of spin–orbit coupling in relativistic calculations and for applications to finite magnetic fields. For the latter, we use London atomic orbitals to ensure gauge origin invariance. It is shown that this formalism is superior to the more common canonical noncollinear approach in relativistic calculations, as it naturally includes all three spin current densities in the closed-shell limit and avoids the projection onto the spin magnetization vector. This is important to easily restore rotational invariance in this limit. In addition, the Scalmani–Frisch approach can be made numerically stable and may lead to a nonvanishing local magnetic torque. However, both formalisms are rotationally invariant for open-shell systems and in finite magnetic fields.</span>

# Experimental evidence of Tc enhancement above 50 K and diode and paramagnetic-Meissner effects, in Nickelate films on highly reduced SrTiO3

## 在高度还原的SrTiO3上的镍酸盐薄膜中，Tc增强超过50 K和二极管和顺磁-迈斯纳效应的实验证据

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6070455/latest

Since the discovery of superconductivity in nickelate thin films in 2019, the quest for enhancing their Tc has been ongoing. Here we provide experimental evidence for Tc enhancement in oxygen deficient films on highly reduced and conducting SrT iO3 substrates. Tc onset of 50-70 K was found in Meissner and transport measurements, which indicates superconductivity in islands or domains in our films, where Tc of zero resistance is obtained at 20-25 K. In addition, we observed a giant paramagnetic-Meissner effect peak at about 48 K, which further supports the existence of a superconductive transition just above it. Furthermore, an asymmetric or nonreciprocal and non-hysteretic superconductive diode effect was observed. The later could be fully polarized, and its polarity could be reversed. The specific phase responsible for these notable effects was not yet identified, and further research is needed in order to identify and isolate the relevant phase.
