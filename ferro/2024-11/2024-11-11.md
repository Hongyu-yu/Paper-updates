# Dynamically generated spin-interactions and nutational spin inertia in normal metal-ferromagnet heterostructures

## 正常金属-铁磁体异质结构中动态产生的自旋相互作用和自旋惯性

arXiv:2411.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spin dynamics of a normal metal-ferromagnet heterostructure, with emphasis on spin-nutation terms arising from a dynamical Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. We find that the spin-nutation term is anisotropic in spin space due to the broken time-reversal symmetry of the ferromagnet. This contrasts with what one obtains in the paramagnetic state, where the nutation term is isotropic in spin space. We compute the effects this has on the magnetization dynamics derived from a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In particular, due to broken time-reversal symmetry, we predict a third ferromagnetic resonance due to nutational spin dynamics. This resonance frequency is tunable by applying an external magnetic field. We propose this as a strong indicator for the existence of nutation in spin systems.

# Effects of doping on polar order in SrTiO$_{3}$ from first-principles modeling

## 掺杂对SrTiO $_{3}$ 极性阶的影响

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05112

arXiv:2411.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrTiO$_{3}$ is an incipient ferroelectric and an exceptionally dilute superconductor with a dome-like dependence on carrier concentration. Stabilization of a polar phase through chemical substitution or strain significantly enhances the superconducting critical temperature, suggesting a possible connection between the polar instability and unconventional Cooper pairing. To investigate the effects of doping on the polar order in SrTiO$_{3}$, we develop a simplified free energy model which includes only the degrees of freedom necessary to capture the relevant physics of a doped, biaxially compressively strained system. We simulate the polar and antiferrodistortive thermal phase transitions using Monte Carlo methods for different doping levels and comment on the doping dependence of the transition temperatures and the formation of polar nanodomains. In addition, the temperature-dependent phonon spectral function is calculated using Langevin simulations to investigate the lattice dynamics of the doped system. We also examine the effects of doping on the electronic structure within the polar phase, including the density of states and band splitting. Finally, we compute the polarization dependence of the Rashba parameter and the doping dependence of the Midgal ratio, and place our results in the broader context of proposed pairing mechanisms.

# Field-Induced Criticality in YbCu4Au

## YbCu4Au中的场诱导临界

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05280

arXiv:2411.05280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YbCu4Au is a unique material exhibiting multiple quantum fluctuations simultaneously. In this study, we investigated the field-induced criticality in YbCu4Au, based on comprehensive micro and macro measurements, including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), neutron powder diffraction (NPD), nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetization, resistivity, specific heat, muon spin rotation relaxation (muSR), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Single crystals of YbCu4Au were grown, and their crystal structure was determined using XRD, and NPD measurements. Magnetic successive transitions were observed below 1 T by specific heat, resistivity, NPD, and muSR measurements. XAS measurements further indicate that the valence of Yb ions (+2.93) remained unchanged above 2 T. Moreover, the change in quadrupole frequency observed in the previous study is attributable to the electric quadrupole, as the expected value of the electric quadrupole was finite under magnetic fields [S. Wada et al., Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter, 20, 175201 (2008).]. These experimental results suggest that YbCu4Au exhibited bicritical behavior near 1 T, arising from the competition between RKKY interaction, accounting for the magnetic phases, and the Zeeman effect.

Abstract: Narrow-gap rare-earth Zintl phases frequently exhibit fascinating physical phenomena due to their various crystal structures, complex magnetic properties, and tunable transport behaviors. Here we report the synthesis, magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of a Eu-containing Zintl arsenide, Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$, which consists of infinite chains of Eu cations and anionic frameworks constructed from corner-sharing ZnAs$_4$ tetrahedra. Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$ exhibits complicated magnetic behavior owing to intricate exchange interactions mediated by the discrete anionic fragments. Two long-range magnetic transitions at 22 K ($T_\mathrm{N}$) and 9 K ($T^*$), as well as exceptionally strong ferromagnetic fluctuations around 29 K ($T_\mathrm{F}$), are indicated by the susceptibility, heat capacity and resistivity measurements. Besides, Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$ displays metallic behavior, attributable to the hole carriers doped by slight Eu vacancies or the mixed valence of Eu$^{2+}$ and Eu$^{3+}$. A prominent resistivity peak occurs around $T_\mathrm{N}$, which is rapidly suppressed by the applied field, leading to a prominent negative magnetoresistance effect. A resistivity hysteresis is observed below 5 K, caused by a small net ferromagnetic component. Our study presents the distinct magnetic and transport properties of Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$, and further experiments are required to elucidate the origin of these novel behaviors. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that Eu-based Zintl phases are a fertile ground to study the interplay between magnetism and charge transport.

# Tuning magnetic anisotropy in Fe$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$ monolayer through doping and strain

## 通过掺杂和应变调节Fe $_{ 5}$ GeTe $_{ 2}$ 单层中的磁各向异性

arXiv:2411.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials is crucial for designing novel spintronic devices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the magnetic properties of monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ (F5GT) under two scenarios: (I) Co and Ni doping, and (II) compressive and tensile strains. Our results show that the F5GT monolayer exhibits a weak in-plane MAE, which can be significantly enhanced by Co doping. Additionally, a $1\%$ compressive strain switches the magnetic easy axis from in-plane to out-of-plane, while $4\%$ compressive strain can further enhance the out-of-plane MAE. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) matrix analysis reveals that the enhancement of in-plane MAE in Co-doped F5GT (Co-F5GT) arises from changes in $ \left\langle {\it p}_{x} \left\vert L_z\right\vert {\it p}_{y} \right\rangle $ of Te and $ \left\langle {\it d}_{xy} \left\vert L_z\right\vert {\it d}_{x^2+y^2} \right\rangle $ of Fe(2) and Fe(3). The effect of compressive strain is primarily attributed to a substantial increase in the positive contribution from $ \left\langle {\it d}_{xy} \left\vert L_z\right\vert {\it d}_{x^2+y^2} \right\rangle $ of Fe(1).

arXiv:2411.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To identify what types of non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior are most likely to occur in cubic metals due to doublet impurities, we derive every cubic symmetry-allowed, NFL, Kondo-type exchange coupling. We find three distinct types of NFL behavior: two-channel Kondo (2CK) behavior for a non-Kramers doublet impurity coupled to local $\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons; topological Kondo physics for a Kramers doublet impurity and $\Gamma_4$ or $\Gamma_5$ conduction electrons; and lastly, spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron Kondo behavior for a Kramers doublet impurity and $\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons. The first two critical behaviors are not straightforward to realize. In the first case, 2CK physics is not guaranteed, since cubic symmetry does not prevent an effective spatial anisotropy from exceeding the 2CK coupling, which restores a Fermi liquid behavior. In the second case, the topological Kondo interaction is guaranteed to dominate, however, the spin degeneracy of the conduction electrons needs to be lifted e.g. by a magnetic field$-$so that they can be represented by $\Gamma_4$ or $\Gamma_5$ triplets$-$which then also lifts the degeneracy of the Kramers doublet. We find that the spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron, NFL, Kondo behavior has the greatest chance of existing in diluted, cubic compounds. We compute the thermodynamics of the topological Kondo model using the numerical renormalization group, and discuss the thermodynamics of the spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron Kondo model. We also identify candidate materials where the corresponding NFL behaviors could be observed.

arXiv:2411.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising platforms for quantum technologies and optoelectronics, with defects playing a crucial role in their properties. We present a comprehensive density functional theory study of silicon and carbon vacancies in monolayer silicon carbide (1L-SiC), a wide-bandgap 2D semiconductor with potential for room-temperature quantum applications. Using PBE, SCAN, r$^2$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals, we reveal distinct characteristics between Si and C vacancies. Formation energies and charge transition levels show strong functional dependence, with HSE06 consistently predicting higher values and deeper transition levels compared to PBE calculations. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates contrasting behavior: silicon vacancies create highly localized states with strong spin polarization, while carbon vacancies produce more dispersed states with weaker magnetic properties. Vacancy migration studies reveal significantly lower barriers for silicon vacancies compared to carbon vacancies, indicating higher mobility for Si vacancies at moderate temperatures. Optical properties, calculated using PBE-DFPT, show distinct charge-state dependent absorption in the far-infrared region, with positively charged states of both vacancy types demonstrating the strongest response. The complementary characteristics of Si and C vacancies - localized versus dispersed states, different magnetic properties, and distinct optical responses - suggest possibilities for defect engineering in quantum and optoelectronic applications. Our results highlight the critical importance of advanced functionals in accurately describing defect properties and provide a comprehensive framework for understanding vacancy behavior in 2D materials.

# 2D versus 3D-like electrical behavior of MXene thin films: insights from weak localization in the role of thickness, interflake coupling and defects

## MXene薄膜的2D与3d类电行为: 从厚度，薄片间耦合和缺陷的作用中弱定位的见解

arXiv:2411.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MXenes stand out from other 2D materials because they combine very good electrical conductivity with hydrophilicity, allowing cost-effective processing as thin films. Therefore, there is a high fundamental interest in unraveling the electronic transport mechanisms at stake in multilayers of the most conducting MXene, Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$. Although weak localization (WL) has been proposed as the dominating low-temperature (LT) transport mechanism in Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ thin films, there have been few attempts to model it quantitatively. In this paper, the role of important structural parameters -- thickness, interflake coupling, defects -- on the dimensionality of the LT transport mechanisms in spin-coated Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ thin films is investigated through LT and magnetic field dependent resistivity measurements. A dimensional crossover from 2D to 3D WL is clearly evidenced when the film thickness exceeds the dephasing length $l_\phi$, which is in the $50-100\,\mathrm{nm}$ range. 2D WL can be restored by weakening the coupling between adjacent flakes, the intrinsic thickness of which is lower than $l_\phi$, hence acting as parallel 2D conductors. Alternatively, $l_\phi$ can be reduced down to the $10\,\mathrm{nm}$ range by defects. Our results clearly emphasize the ability of WL quantitative study to give deep insights in the physics of electron transport in MXene thin films.

# Stability of the first-order character of phase transition in HoCo$_2$

## HoCo $_2 $ 相变一阶特征的稳定性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05509

arXiv:2411.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HoCo$_2$ exhibits a giant magnetocaloric (MC) effect at its first-order magnetostructural phase transition around 77~K, and understanding the thermodynamic nature of this transition in response to external magnetic fields is crucial for its MC applications. In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of specific heat and magnetization measurements of HoCo$_2$ under varying magnetic fields. The specific heat measurements qualitatively indicate a transformation from first- to second-order behavior of this phase transition at higher magnetic fields. However, analysis of the power-law dependence of the magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{\rm M} \propto$ H$^n$) and the breakdown of universal behavior in the temperature dependence of $\Delta S_{\rm M}$ suggest that the first-order nature remains intact, even up to 7 T. This stability of the first-order nature is further manifested through the distinctive non-linear behavior of modified Arrott plots, with a negative slope in the 6--7 T range.

# Piezovalley effect and magnetovalley coupling in altermagnetic semiconductors

arXiv:2411.05518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clarifying the physical origin of valley polarization and exploring new ferrovalley materials are conducive to the application of valley degrees of freedom in the field of information storage. Here, we explore two new-type altermagnetic semiconductors (monolayers Nb2Se2O and Nb2SeTeO) with above-room-temperature N\'eel temperature based on first-principles calculations. It reveals that uniaxial strain induces valley polarization without spin-orbital coupling (SOC) in altermagnets owing to the piezovalley effect, while uniaxial compressive strain transforms from ferrovalley semiconductor to semimetal, half metal and metal. Moreover, moderate biaxial strain renders Janus monolayer Nb2SeTeO to robust Dirac-like band dispersion. The SOC and intrinsic in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy induces Dirac-like altermagnets to generate apparent valley polarization through magnetovalley coupling. In terms of SOC perturbation, we elucidate the physical mechanism behind in-plane-magnetization induced valley polarization and point out the magnitude of valley polarization is positively correlated with the square of SOC strength and negatively correlated with the bandgap. The present work reveals the physical origin of valley polarization in altermagnets and expands the application of ferrovalley at room temperature in valleytronics.

Abstract: The impact of shear deformation in $(1\,0\,1)[1\,0\,\bar{1}]$ system of non-modulated (NM) martensite in Ni$_2$MnGa ferromagnetic shape memory alloy is investigated by means of ab initio atomistic simulations. The shear system is associated with twinning of NM lattice and intermatensitic transformation to modulated structures. The stability of the NM lattice increases with increasing content of Mn. The most realistic shear mechanism for twin reorientation can be approximated by the simple shear mechanism, although the lowest barriers were calculated for pure shear mechanism. The energy barrier between twin variants further reduces due to spontaneous appearance of lattice modulation or, in other words, the nanotwins with thickness of two atomic planes. Such nanotwins appear also on the generalized planar fault energy (GPFE) curve calculated using a newly developed advanced procedure and exhibits even lower energy than the defect free NM structure. These nanotwin doublelayers are also basic building blocks of modulated structures and play an important role in intermartensitic transformation.

arXiv:2411.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perpendicular magnetic field penetrating a thin type-II superconductor slab produces vortices, with one vortex per flux quantum, h/2e. The vortices interact repulsively and form an ordered array (Abrikosov lattice) in clean systems, while strong disorder changes the lattice into a vortex glass. Here we investigate type-II superconducting films (PbBi2 and NbSe2) with surface acoustic waves (SAWs) at mK temperature. When sweeping the magnetic field at an extremely slow rate, we observe a series of spikes in the attenuation and velocity of the SAW, on average separated in field by approximately Hc1. We suspect the following scenario: The vortex-free region at the edges of the film produces an edge barrier across which the vortices can enter or leave. When the applied field changes, the induced supercurrents flowing along this edge region lowers this barrier until there is an instability. At that point, vortices avalanche into (or out of) the bulk and change the vortex crystal, suggested by the sharp jump in each such spike. The vortices then gradually relax to a new stable pinned configuration, leading to a ~30s relaxation after the jump. Our observation enriches the limited experimental evidence on the important topic of real-time vortex dynamics in superconductors.

Abstract: Experimental determination of the structure of the superconducting order parameter in the kagome lattice compound CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an essential step towards understanding the nature of the superconducting pairing in this material. Here we report measurements of the temperature dependence of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in crystals of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ down to $\sim 60\,\mathrm{mK}$. We find that $\lambda(T)$ is consistent with a fully-gapped state but with significant gap anisotropy. The magnitude of the gap minima are in the range $\sim 0.2 - 0.3 T_\mathrm{c}$ for the measured samples, markedly smaller than previous estimates. We discuss different forms of potential anisotropy and how these can be linked to the V and Sb Fermi surface sheets. We highlight a significant discrepancy between the calculated and measured values of $\lambda(T=0)$ which we suggest is caused by spatially suppressed superconductivity.

Abstract: We present the results of microscopic investigations of antiferromagnetic CeNiGe$_3$, using neutron powder diffraction (NPD), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. CeNiGe$_3$ crystallizes in a centrosymmetric orthorhombic crystal structure (space group: $Cmmm$) and undergoes antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. The occurrence of long-range AFM ordering at $T_{\rm N} \approx 5.2$~K is confirmed by magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, neutron diffraction, and $\mu$SR measurements. The NPD data characterize the AFM state with an incommensurate helical magnetic structure having a propagation vector $k$ = (0, 0.41, 1/2). In addition, INS measurements at 10~K identified two crystal electric field (CEF) excitations at 9.17~meV and 18.42~meV. We analyzed the INS data using a CEF model for an orthorhombic environment of Ce$^{3+}$ ($J=5/2$) and determined the CEF parameters and ground state wavefunctions of CeNiGe$_3$. Moreover, zero-field $\mu$SR data for CeNiGe$_3$ at $T< T_{\rm N}$ show long-range AFM ordering with three distinct oscillation frequencies corresponding to three different internal fields at the muon sites. The internal fields at the muon-stopping sites have been further investigated using density functional theory calculations.

Abstract: We study the superconducting critical fields of two-dimensional electron systems at (111)$\mathrm{LaAlO_3/KTaO_3}$ interfaces as a function of electrostatic back-gating. Our work reveals inplane critical fields of unprecedented magnitudes at oxide interfaces. By comparing the critical fields in-plane and out-of-plane we discover an extremely anisotropic superconductor with an effective thickness below 1 nm and a 12-fold violation of the Chandrasekhar-Clogston paramagnetic limit. The analysis of magneto-transport indicates that the enhancement of the critical fields is due to an exceptionally thin superconducting layer and to a paramagnetic susceptibility suppressed by spin-orbit scattering.

# Giant spin Hall effect with multi-directional spin components in Ni4W

arXiv:2411.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) can be used to efficiently manipulate the magnetic state of magnetic materials, which is an essential element for memory and logic applications. Due to symmetry constraints, only in-plane spins can be injected into the ferromagnet from the underlying SOT layer for conventional SOT materials such as heavy metals and topological materials. Through the use of materials with low symmetries, or other symmetry breaking approaches, unconventional spin currents with out-of-plane polarization has been demonstrated and enabled field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. Despite this progress, the SOT efficiency of these materials has typically remained low. Here, we report a giant SOT efficiency of 0.85 in sputtered Ni4W/CoFeB heterostructure at room temperature, as evaluated by second harmonic Hall measurements. In addition, due to the low crystal symmetry of Ni4W, unconventional out-of-plane and Dresselhaus-like spin components were observed. Macro-spin simulation suggests our spin Hall tensor to provide about an order of magnitude improvement in the magnetization switching efficiency, thus broadening the path towards energy efficient spintronic devices using low-symmetry materials.

Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays an important role in the Hall effects. Unconventional spin Hall effect (USHE), characterized by Dresselhaus and out-of-plane spins, has been observed in materials with low crystal symmetry. Recently, antisymmetric planar Hall effect (APHE) was discovered in rutile RuO$_2$ and IrO$_2$ (101) thin films, which also exhibit low crystal symmetry. However, the correlation between USHE and APHE remains largely unexplored. In this study, we report the observation of both USHE and APHE in IrO$_2$ (111) films, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively. Notably, the unconventional spin torque efficiency from Dresselhaus spin was more than double that of a previous report. Additionally, the temperature dependence of APHE suggests that it arises from the Lorentz force, constrained by crystal symmetry. Symmetry analysis confirms the coexistence of USHE and APHE in IrO$_2$ (111), paving the way for a deeper understanding of Hall effects and related physical phenomena.

Abstract: Time-dependent Thermoremanent Magnetization (TRM) studies have been instrumental in probing energy dynamics within the spin glass phase. In this paper, we will review the evolution of the TRM experiment over the last half century and discuss some aspects related to how it has been employed in the understanding of spin glasses. We will also report on recent experiments using high resolution DC SQUID magnetometry to probe the TRM at temperatures less than but near to the transition temperature Tc. These experiments have been performed as a function of waiting time, temperature, and five different magnetic fields. We find that as the transition temperature is approached from below, the characteristic time scale of the TRM is suppressed up to several orders of magnitude in time. In the highest temperature region, we find that the waiting time effect goes away, and a waiting time independent crossover line is reached. We also find that increasing the magnetic field, further suppresses the crossover line. Using a first principles energy argument across the crossover line, we derive an equation that is an excellent fit to the crossover lines for all magnetic fields probed. The data show strong evidence for an H = 0 Oe phase transition.

Abstract: Device-to-device variations in ferroelectric (FE) hafnium oxide-based devices pose a crucial challenge that limits the otherwise promising capabilities of this technology. Earlier simulation-based studies have identified polarization (P) domain nucleation and polycrystallinity as key contributors to these variations. In this work, we experimentally investigate the effect of these two factors on remanent polarization (PR) variation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) based metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) capacitors for different set voltages (VSET) and FE thicknesses (TFE). Our measurements reveal a non-monotonic behavior of PR variations with VSET, which is consistent with previous simulation-based predictions. For low and high-VSET regions, we find that PR variations are dictated primarily by saturation polarization (PS) variations and are associated with the polycrystallinity in HZO. Our measurements also reveal that PR variations peak near the coercive voltage (VC), defined as the mid-VSET region. We attribute the increase of PR variation around VC to the random nature and sharp P switching associated with domain nucleation, which is dominant near VC. Further, we observe a reduction in the peak PR variation as HZO thickness (TFE) is scaled. We validate our arguments by establishing the correlation between the measured values of PR with VC and PS. Our results display that a strong correlation exists between PR and VC in the mid-VSET region and between PR and PS in the low and high-VSET regions across various TFE.

Abstract: Understanding boundary layer flows in high Reynolds number (Re) turbulence is crucial for advancing fluid dynamics in a wide range of applications, from improving aerodynamic efficiency in aviation to optimizing energy systems in industrial processes. However, generating such flows requires complex, power-intensive large-scale facilities. Furthermore, the use of local probes, such as hot wires and pressure sensors, often introduces disturbances due to the necessary support structures, compromising measurement accuracy. In this paper, we present a solution that leverages the vanishingly small viscosity of liquid helium to produce high Re flows, combined with an innovative Particle Levitation Velocimetry (PLV) system for precise flow-field measurements. This PLV system uses magnetically levitated superconducting micro-particles to measure the near-wall velocity field in liquid helium. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the PLV system enables quantitative measurements of the velocity boundary layer over a wall unit range of $44\le y^{+}\le 4400$, with a spatial resolution that, depending on the particle size, can reach down to about 10~$\mu$m. This development opens new avenues for exploring turbulence structures and correlations within the thin boundary layer that would be otherwise difficult to achieve.

Abstract: We investigate a relation between non-invertible symmetries and selection rules of topological solitons such as axionic domain walls and magnetic strings in the $(3+1)$-dimensional axion electrodynamics with a massive axion or a massive photon. In the low-energy limit of the phases where either the axion or the photon is massive, we identify non-invertible 0- or 1-form symmetry generators as axionic domain walls or magnetic strings, respectively. By non-invertible transformations on magnetic monopoles or axionic strings, we give constraints on possible configurations of topological solitons in the presence of the monopoles or axionic strings. Our results are consistent with a solution to the axionic domain wall problem by the magnetic monopole. Further, we give a new constraint on a linked configuration of the magnetic and axionic strings.

Abstract: Quantum magnetometers based on spin defects in solids enable sensitive imaging of various magnetic phenomena, such as ferro- and antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and current-induced fields. Existing protocols primarily focus on static fields or narrow-band dynamical signals, and are optimized for high sensitivity rather than fast time resolution. Here, we report detection of fast signal transients, providing a perspective for investigating the rich dynamics of magnetic systems. We experimentally demonstrate our technique using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometer at room temperature, reaching a best-effort time resolution of 1.1 ns, an instantaneous bandwidth of 0.9 GHz, and a time-of-flight precision better than 20 ps. The time resolution can be extended to the picosecond range by use of on-chip waveguides. At these speeds, NV quantum magnetometers will become competitive with time-resolved synchrotron X-ray techniques. Looking forward, adding fast temporal resolution to the spatial imaging capability further promotes single-spin probes as powerful research tools in spintronics, mesoscopic physics, and nanoscale device metrology.

# Phases of decodability in the surface code with unitary errors

## 具有单一错误的表面代码中的可解码性阶段

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05785

arXiv:2411.05785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum likelihood (ML) decoder in the two-dimensional surface code with generic unitary errors is governed by a statistical mechanics model with complex weights, which can be simulated via (1+1)D transfer matrix contraction. Information loss with an increasing error rate manifests as a ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition in the contraction dynamics. In this work, we establish entanglement as a separate obstruction to decoding; it can undergo a transition from area- to volume-law scaling in the transfer matrix contraction with increasing unitary error rate. In particular, the volume-law entanglement can coexist with ferromagnetic order, giving rise to a phase in which the encoded information is retained yet is effectively undecodable. We numerically simulate the ML decoding in the surface code subject to both single- and two-qubit Pauli-X rotations and obtain a phase diagram that contains a ferromagnetic area-law, a paramagnetic volume-law, and a potential ferromagnetic volume-law phase. We further show that, starting from the paramagnetic volume-law phase, tilting the single-qubit rotation away from the X-axis couples the stat-mech models for X and Z errors and can lead to a ferromagnetic volume-law phase in which, although Z errors remain correctable, the encoded classical information is hard to recover. To perform numerical simulations, we develop an algorithm for syndrome sampling based on the isometric tensor network representation of the surface code.

Abstract: The possibility of selecting magnetic space groups by orienting the magnetization direction or tuning magnetic orders offers a vast playground for engineering symmetry protected topological phases in magnetic materials. In this work, we study how selective tuning of symmetry and magnetism can influence and control the resulting topology in a 2D magnetic system, and illustrate such procedure in the ferromagnetic monolayer MnPSe$_3$. Density functional theory calculations reveals a symmetry-protected accidental semimetalic (SM) phase for out-of-plane magnetization which becomes an insulator when the magnetization is tilted in-plane, reaching band gap values close to $100$ meV. We identify an order-two composite antiunitary symmetry and threefold rotational symmetry that induce the band crossing and classify the possible topological phases using symmetry analysis, which we support with tight-binding and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ models. Breaking of inversion symmetry opens a gap in the SM phase, giving rise to a Chern insulator. We demonstrate this explicitly in the isostructural Janus compound Mn$_2$P$_2$S$_3$Se$_3$, which naturally exhibits Rashba spin-orbit coupling that breaks inversion symmetry. Our results map out the phase space of topological properties of ferromagnetic transition metal phosphorus trichalcogenides and demonstrate the potential of the magnetization-dependent metal-to-insulator transition as a spin switch in integrated two-dimensional electronics.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum Hall effect in a single Landau level in the presence of a square superlattice of $\delta$-function potentials. The interplay between the superlattice spacing $a_s$ and the magnetic length $\ell_B$ in clean system leads to three interesting characteristic regimes corresponding to $a_s \lt \ell_B$, $a_s \gg \ell_B$ and the intermediate one where $a_s \sim \ell_B$ . In the intermediate regime, the continuous magnetic translation symmetry breaks down to discrete lattice symmetry. In contrast, we show that in the other two regimes, the same is hardly broken in the topological band despite the presence of the superlattice. In the presence of weak disorder (white-noise) one typically expects a tiny fraction of extended states due to topological protection of the Landau level. Interestingly, we obtain a large fraction of extended states throughout the intermediate regime which maximizes at the special point $a_s = \sqrt{2\pi} \ell_B$. We argue the superlattice induced percolation phenomenon requires both the breaking of the time reversal symmetry and the continuous magnetic translational symmetry. It could have a direct implication on the integer plateau transitions in both continuous quantum Hall systems and the lattice based anomalous quantum Hall effect.

Abstract: We present a high-resolution single crystal x-ray diffraction study of kagome-superconductor \cvs, exploring its response to variations in pressure and temperature. We discover that at low temperatures, the structural modulations of the electronic superlattice, commonly associated with charge-density-wave order, undergo a transformation around $p \sim$ 0.7 GPa from the familiar $2\times2$ pattern to a long-range-ordered modulation at wavevector $q=(0, 3/8, 1/2)$. Our observations align with inferred changes in the CDW pattern from prior transport and nuclear-magnetic-resonance studies, providing new insights into these transitions. Interestingly, the pressure-induced variations in the electronic superlattice correlate with two peaks in the superconducting transition temperature as pressure changes, hinting that fluctuations within the electronic superlattice could be key to stabilizing superconductivity. However, our findings contrast with the minimal pressure dependency anticipated by ab initio calculations of the electronic structure. They also challenge prevailing scenarios based on a Peierls-like nesting mechanism involving van Hove singularities.

# Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets

Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have attracted intensive attention for the realization of fractional quantum Hall states in the absence of an external magnetic field. Most of FCIs have been proposed on two-dimensional (2D) Euclidean lattice models with various boundary conditions. In this work, we investigate hyperbolic FCIs which are constructed in hyperbolic geometry with constant negative curvature. Through the studies on hyperbolic analogs of kagome lattices with hard-core bosons loaded into topological flat bands, we find convincing numerical evidences of two types of $\nu=1/2$ FCI states, {\emph {i.e.}}, the conventional and unconventional FCIs. Multiple branches of edge excitations and geometry-dependent wave functions for both conventional and unconventional $\nu=1/2$ FCI states are revealed, however, the geometric degree of freedom in these FCIs plays various roles. Additionally, a center-localized orbital plays a crucial role in the unconventional FCI state.

Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the modulation of magnetic anisotropy and the strength of spin-orbit interaction by an electrical current in nanomagnets. Our systematic study explores the current dependencies of these properties across a variety of nanomagnets with different structures, compositions, and sizes, providing unprecedented insights into the complex physical origins of this effect. We identified two distinct contributions to the observed current modulation: one proportional to the current and the other to the square of the current. The squared-current contribution, originating from the Spin Hall effect, uniquely accumulates strength with an increasing number of interfaces, resulting in exceptionally large current modulation of magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interaction in multi-layer nanomagnets. Conversely, the linear-current contribution stems from the Ordinary and Anomalous Hall effects and exhibits opposite polarity at different interfaces, making it significant only in asymmetrical single-layer nanomagnets. The squared-current contribution induces substantial anisotropy field changes, up to 30-50$\%$ at typical MRAM recording currents, leading to thermally-activated magnetization reversal and data recording. The linear-current contribution, while smaller, is effective for parametric magnetization reversal, providing sufficient modulation for efficient data recording through resonance mechanisms. This finding highlights the complex nature of spin accumulation and spin dynamics at the nanoscale, presenting an opportunity for further optimization of data recording in MRAM technology.

arXiv:2407.19756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrinsic spin currents are encountered in noncentrosymmetric crystals without any external electric fields; these currents are caused by spin-orbit interaction. In this paper, various theoretical aspects of this phenomenon in bulk ferromagnets are studied by using group theory, perturbation expansion, and calculations for model and real systems. The group-theoretical analysis of the spin-current tensor shows that the absence of space-inversion symmetry is not a sufficient condition for appearance of the intrinsic spin currents. The perturbation expansion proves that in the regime of exchange splitting dominating over spin-orbit interaction, the spin polarization of the intrinsic currents is nearly perpendicular to the direction of magnetization. First-principles calculations are carried out for NiMnSb and CoMnFeSi ferromagnetic compounds, both featured by a tetrahedral crystallographic point group. The dependence of the spin-current tensor on the direction of magnetization is approximated by a simple quadratic formula containing two constants; the relative error of this approximation is found as small as a few percent for both compounds.

Abstract: We investigate the Friedel oscillations of the local density of states (LDOS) induced by a single impurity with both a spin-independent potential and an exchange coupling to the electrons in altermagnets and unconventional $p$-wave magnets. We identify features that make the Friedel oscillations and magnetization distinct from other materials with nontrivial spin texture such as Rashba metals. Because time-reversal symmetry is broken in altermagnets, both magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities lead to local magnetization with the spatial pattern that reflects the symmetry of the altermagnetic splitting. The period of the corresponding oscillations provides an alternative way to quantify the altermagnetic spin splitting and the shape of the altermagnetic bands. The LDOS pattern in $p$-wave magnets, which respect combined time-reversal and translation symmetries, is rich. It reveals anisotropy related directly to the spin splitting, but surprisingly also features LDOS oscillations with a doubled period in the proximity of the impurity. The latter effect is also observed in a Rashba metal with an exchange field and originates from the interplay of propagating and evanescent waves. The obtained results are instrumental for investigating altermagnets and unconventional $p$-wave magnets via tunneling probes.

Abstract: Rutile RuO$_2$ has been posited as a potential $d$-wave altermagnetism candidate, with a predicted significant spin splitting up to 1.4 eV. Despite accumulating theoretical predictions and transport measurements, direct spectroscopic observation of spin splitting has remained elusive. Here, we employ spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the band structures and spin polarization of thin-film and single-crystal RuO$_2$. Contrary to expectations of altermagnetism, our analysis indicates that RuO$_2$'s electronic structure aligns with those predicted under non-magnetic conditions, exhibiting no evidence of the hypothesized spin splitting. Additionally, we observe significant in-plane spin polarization of the low-lying bulk bands, which is antisymmetric about the high-symmetry plane and contrary to the $d$-wave spin texture due to time-reversal symmetry breaking in altermagnetism. These findings definitively challenge the altermagnetic order previously proposed for rutile RuO$_2$, prompting a reevaluation of its magnetic properties.

Abstract: The study of phase transitions in frustrated magnetic systems with $O(N)\times O(2)$ symmetry has been the subject of controversy for more than twenty years, with theoretical, numerical and experimental results in disagreement. Even theoretical studies lead to different results, with some predicting a first-order phase transition while others find it to be second-order. Recently, a series of results from both numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, in particular those based on the Conformal Bootstrap, have rekindled interest in this controversy, especially as they are still not in agreement with each other. Studies based on the functional renormalization group have played a major role in this controversy in the past, and we revisit these studies, taking them a step further by adding non-trivial second order derivative terms to the derivative expansion of the effective action. We confirm the first-order nature of the phase transition for physical values of $N$, i.e. for $N=2$ and $N=3$ in agreement with the latest results obtained with the Conformal Bootstrap. We also study an other phase of the $O(N)\times O(2)$ models, called the sinusoidal phase, qualitatively confirming earlier perturbative results.

Abstract: By extending the gauge covariant magnetic perturbation theory to operators defined on half-planes, we prove that for $2d$ random ergodic magnetic Schr\"odinger operators, the zero-temperature bulk-edge correspondence can be obtained from a general bulk-edge duality at positive temperature involving the bulk magnetization and the total edge current.
  Our main result is encapsulated in a formula, which states that the derivative of a large class of bulk partition functions with respect to the external constant magnetic field, equals the expectation of a corresponding edge distribution function of the velocity component which is parallel to the edge. Neither spectral gaps, nor mobility gaps, nor topological arguments are required.
  The equality between the bulk and edge indices, as stated by the conventional bulk-edge correspondence, is obtained as a corollary of our purely analytical arguments by imposing a gap condition and by taking a ``zero-temperature" limit.

Abstract: The high-performance computing (HPC) community has recently seen a substantial diversification of hardware platforms and their associated programming models. From traditional multicore processors to highly specialized accelerators, vendors and tool developers back up the relentless progress of those architectures. In the context of scientific programming, it is fundamental to consider performance portability frameworks, i.e., software tools that allow programmers to write code once and run it on different computer architectures without sacrificing performance. We report here on the benefits and challenges of performance portability using a field-line tracing simulation and a particle-in-cell code, two relevant applications in computational plasma physics with applications to magnetically-confined nuclear-fusion energy research. For these applications we report performance results obtained on four HPC platforms with server-class CPUs from Intel (Xeon) and AMD (EPYC), and high-end GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, including the latest Nvidia H100 GPU and the novel AMD Instinct MI300A APU. Our results show that both Kokkos and OpenMP are powerful tools to achieve performance portability and decent "out-of-the-box" performance, even for the very latest hardware platforms. For our applications, Kokkos provided performance portability to the broadest range of hardware architectures from different vendors.

arXiv:2411.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-to-device variations in ferroelectric (FE) hafnium oxide-based devices pose a crucial challenge that limits the otherwise promising capabilities of this technology. Earlier simulation-based studies have identified polarization (P) domain nucleation and polycrystallinity as key contributors to these variations. In this work, we experimentally investigate the effect of these two factors on remanent polarization (PR) variation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) based metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) capacitors for different set voltages (VSET) and FE thicknesses (TFE). Our measurements reveal a non-monotonic behavior of PR variations with VSET, which is consistent with previous simulation-based predictions. For low and high-VSET regions, we find that PR variations are dictated primarily by saturation polarization (PS) variations and are associated with the polycrystallinity in HZO. Our measurements also reveal that PR variations peak near the coercive voltage (VC), defined as the mid-VSET region. We attribute the increase of PR variation around VC to the random nature and sharp P switching associated with domain nucleation, which is dominant near VC. Further, we observe a reduction in the peak PR variation as HZO thickness (TFE) is scaled. We validate our arguments by establishing the correlation between the measured values of PR with VC and PS. Our results display that a strong correlation exists between PR and VC in the mid-VSET region and between PR and PS in the low and high-VSET regions across various TFE.

Abstract: Understanding boundary layer flows in high Reynolds number (Re) turbulence is crucial for advancing fluid dynamics in a wide range of applications, from improving aerodynamic efficiency in aviation to optimizing energy systems in industrial processes. However, generating such flows requires complex, power-intensive large-scale facilities. Furthermore, the use of local probes, such as hot wires and pressure sensors, often introduces disturbances due to the necessary support structures, compromising measurement accuracy. In this paper, we present a solution that leverages the vanishingly small viscosity of liquid helium to produce high Re flows, combined with an innovative Particle Levitation Velocimetry (PLV) system for precise flow-field measurements. This PLV system uses magnetically levitated superconducting micro-particles to measure the near-wall velocity field in liquid helium.

arXiv:2411.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum deposition eigenchannel provides the largest possible power delivery to a target region inside a diffusive medium by optimizing the incident wavefront of a monochromatic beam. It originates from constructive interference of scattered waves, which is frequency sensitive. We investigate the spectral width of maximum deposition eigenchannels over a range of target depths using numerical simulations of a 2D diffusive system. Compared to tight focusing into the system, power deposition to an extended region is more sensitive to frequency detuning. The spectral width of enhanced delivery to a large target displays a rather weak, non-monotonic variation with target depth, in contrast to a sharp drop of focusing bandwidth with depth. While the maximum enhancement of power deposited within a diffusive system can exceed that of power transmitted through it, this comes at the cost of a narrower spectral width. We investigate the narrower deposition width in terms of the constructive interference of transmission eigenchannels within the target. We further observe that the spatial field distribution inside the target region decorrelates slower with spectral detuning than power decay of the maximum deposition eigenchannel. Additionally, absorption increases the spectral width of deposition eigenchannels, but the depth dependence remains qualitatively identical to that without absorption. These findings hold for any diffusive waves, including electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves, pressure waves, mesoscopic electrons, and cold atoms.

Abstract: The Moir\'e superlattice has attracted growing interest in the electromagnetic and optical communities. Here, we extend this concept to time-varying photonic systems by superposing two binary modulations on the refractive index with different modulation periods, i.e., the Moir\'e photonic time crystal (PTC). Such a Moir\'e PTC leads to extreme narrow bands in momentum space which supports temporal localized modes, exhibiting periodically self-reconstructing pulse in time domain. We investigate how the modulation parameters change the bandstructure of the Moir\'e PTC and the temporal localization behavior. Moreover, we explore mode-locking mechanism in frequency space in the Moir\'e PTC, which points towards potential applications in mode-locked lasers with tunable time width of the emitted pulses. Our work therefore extends the study of PTC to complex modulation patterns, and unveils new possibility in wave manipulation with time-varying systems.

arXiv:2411.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Purcell effect describes the enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate of an emitter near a resonant structure. However, evaluating the Purcell factor quantitatively and empirically is difficult due to the difficulties in measuring the electromagnetic nearfield of an optical resonance for calculation of the exact effective modal volume, especially with non-Hermitian resonators. Therefore, we propose a new analytical approach to circumvent the need to measure the nearfield and predict the Purcell enhancement with an analytical model and spectrally measurable parameters. Our proposed model predicts the averaged Purcell enhancement by metasurfaces on a photoluminescence medium, and is verified with experimental measurements and numerical simulations of nanoparticle arrays coupled to a fluorescent thin film. The model directly analyzes the photoluminescence enhancement and extraction efficiency of metasurface, and can be generalized to work with arbitrarily-shaped photoluminescent medium that is coupled to a resonator. This discovery will facilitate optimization of metasurfaces that support open cavity modes for efficient extraction of enhanced luminescence.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel dual-port dual-polarized magneto-electric dipole (MED) antenna with orthogonal Gamma and inverted-Gamma shape probes, which was fabricated by means of an additive 3D metal printing process. Electromagnetic wave simulation and RF measurement report a resonance bandwidth from 3 GHz to 4 GHz at both MED's ports with respect to a standing wave ratio of less than 2. The cross-polarization isolation (XPI) between the MED's ports was also measured to be greater than 50 dB across its entire resonance bandwidth. The paper also thoroughly examines the impact of misalignments in the polarization of the MED probes on the XPI level. The broadband resonance and excellent isolation between the MED ports make it a strong candidate for a full-duplex wireless transceiver in network infrastructure.

Abstract: Nearly fifty years ago, Roberts (1978) postulated that Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by turbulent motions of liquid metal in its outer core, likely results from a subcritical dynamo instability characterised by a dominant balance between Coriolis, pressure and Lorentz forces. Here we numerically explore the generation of subcritical geomagnetic fields using techniques from optimal control and dynamical systems theory to uncover the nonlinear dynamical landscape underlying dynamo action. Through nonlinear optimisation, via direct-adjoint looping, we identify the minimal seed - the smallest magnetic field that attracts to a nonlinear dynamo solution. Additionally, using the Newton-hookstep algorithm, we converge stable and unstable travelling wave solutions to the governing equations. By combining these two techniques, complex nonlinear pathways between attracting states are revealed, providing insight into a potential subcritical origin of the geodynamo. This paper showcases these methods on the widely studied benchmark of Christensen et al. (2001), laying the foundations for future studies in more extreme and realistic parameter regimes. We show that the minimal seed reaches a nonlinear dynamo solution by first attracting to an unstable travelling wave solution, which acts as an edge state separating a hydrodynamic solution from a magnetohydrodynamic one. Furthermore, by carefully examining the choice of cost functional, we establish a robust optimisation procedure that can systematically locate dynamo solutions on short time horizons with no prior knowledge of its structure.

Abstract: We propose a technique for transforming the intensity of quasi-monochromatic recoilless radiation with a photon energy of 93.3 keV, emitted by radioactive M\"ossbauer sources 67Ga or 67Cu, into a sequence of short pulses with individually and independently controlled, on demand, the moments of appearance of pulses, as well as the peak intensity, duration and shape of each pulse. The technique is based on the transmission of recoilless (M\"ossbauer) 93.3-keV photons from the source through a medium containing resonantly absorbing 67Zn nuclei. The pulses are formed due to the rapid reciprocating movement of the source relative to the absorber at specified moments in time along the direction of photon propagation at a distance not exceeding half the radiation wavelength. The produced sequences of $\gamma$-ray pulses are similar to the digitization of information carried by electromagnetic waves. They can also be used to develop M\"ossbauer spectroscopy of the atomic and subatomic structures, as well as open novel opportunities for $\gamma$-ray quantum optics.

For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we introduce the concept of moir\'e optical skyrmion clusters-multiskyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster-crystallized or quasi-crystallized as a consequence of the twisted nanostructures. The rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved in the imperfectly aligned composite nanostructures. This moir\'e optical skyrmion interaction mechanism is described by a lattice model. Further, the nucleation and collapse of optical skyrmion are studied, where their nanoscale dynamics are revealed with a tiny change of the twist angle. The sudden reversal of the on-chip skyrmion can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between twisted composite nanostructures.

arXiv:2411.05579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a method for probing the chirality of nanoscale electromagnetic near fields utilizing the properties of a coherent superposition of free-electron vortex states in electron microscopes. Electron beams optically modulated into vortices carry orbital angular momentum, thanks to which they are sensitive to the spatial phase distribution and topology of the investigated field. The sense of chirality of the studied specimen can be extracted from the spectra of the electron beam with nanoscale precision owing to the short picometer de Broglie wavelength of the electron beam. We present a detailed case study of the interaction of a coherent superposition of electron vortex states and the optical near field of a golden nanosphere illuminated by circularly polarized light as an example, and we examine the chirality sensitivity of electron vortex beams on intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanoantennae.

# Electromagnetic Multipole Theory for Two-dimensional Photonics

## 二维光子学的电磁多极理论

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05657

arXiv:2411.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a full-wave electromagnetic (EM) theory for calculating the multipole decomposition in two-dimensional (2-D) structures consisting of isolated, arbitrarily shaped, inhomogeneous, anisotropic cylinders or a collection of such. To derive the multipole decomposition, we first solve the scattering problem by expanding the scattered electric field in divergenceless cylindrical vector wave functions (CVWF) with unknown expansion coefficients that characterize the multipole response. These expansion coefficients are then expressed via contour integrals of the vectorial components of the scattered electric field evaluated via an electric field volume integral equation (EFVIE). The kernels of the EFVIE are the products of the tensorial 2-D Green's function (GF) expansion and the equivalent 2-D volumetric electric and magnetic current densities. We validate the theory using the commercial finite element solver COMSOL Multiphysics. In the validation, we compute the multipole decomposition of the fields scattered from various 2-D structures and compare the results with alternative formulations. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the theory to study an emerging photonics application on oligomers-based highly directional switching using active media. This analysis addresses a critical gap in current literature, where multipole theories exist primarily for three-dimensional (3-D) particles of isotropic materials. Our work enhances the understanding and utilization of the optical properties of 2-D, inhomogeneous, and anisotropic cylindrical structures, contributing to advancements in photonic and meta-optics technologies.

# Quadratic Zeeman and Electric Quadrupole Shifts in Highly Charged Ions

## 高电荷离子中的二次塞曼和电四极位移

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05687

arXiv:2411.05687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in high-precision spectroscopy of highly charged ions necessitate an understanding of energy shifts of ionic levels caused by external electric and magnetic fields. Beyond the well-known Stark and linear Zeeman shifts, trapped ions may also exhibit quadratic Zeeman and electric quadrupole shifts. In this contribution, we present a systematic approach for the theoretical analysis of these shifts for arbitrary many-electron ions. Based on the derived expressions and making use of the multiconfigurational Dirac-Fock approach, we performed calculations of quadratic Zeeman shift coefficients and quadrupole moments for various ionic states in Ca$^{14+}$, Ni$^{12+}$ and Xe$^{q+}$ ions. These ions attract particular interest for ongoing and future experiments in optical clocks and tests of fundamental physics.

# Electromagnetic symmetry dislocations

arXiv:2411.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular optics aims to understand and manipulate light's topological defects, pioneered by the discovery that phase vortex lines, strands of destructive interference, naturally occur in scalar wave fields. Monochromatic electromagnetic fields, however, are described by complex three-dimensional vectors that make individual scalar phase vortices in their vector components, which depend on the choice of co-ordinate basis, less meaningful. Instead, polarisation singularities can capture the vector texture of complicated, even non-paraxial light, with separate spatial descriptions for the electric $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic $\mathbf{H}$ fields. But polarisation textures, too, are basis-dependent, because the laws of electromagnetism can be expressed not only by separate $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ fields, but by linear combinations of the two. We instead propose fundamental, basis-independent topological features generic in monochromatic electromagnetic fields: one- and two-dimensional structures that relate to time-averaged symmetries, including parity, duality and time-reversal, held locally by the combined electric and magnetic field polarisation geometry.

Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.

# Piezovalley effect and magnetovalley coupling in altermagnetic semiconductors

arXiv:2411.05518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarifying the physical origin of valley polarization and exploring new ferrovalley materials are conducive to the application of valley degrees of freedom in the field of information storage. Here, we explore two new-type altermagnetic semiconductors (monolayers Nb2Se2O and Nb2SeTeO) with above-room-temperature N\'eel temperature based on first-principles calculations. It reveals that uniaxial strain induces valley polarization without spin-orbital coupling (SOC) in altermagnets owing to the piezovalley effect, while uniaxial compressive strain transforms from ferrovalley semiconductor to semimetal, half metal and metal. Moreover, moderate biaxial strain renders Janus monolayer Nb2SeTeO to robust Dirac-like band dispersion. The SOC and intrinsic in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy induces Dirac-like altermagnets to generate apparent valley polarization through magnetovalley coupling. In terms of SOC perturbation, we elucidate the physical mechanism behind in-plane-magnetization induced valley polarization and point out the magnitude of valley polarization is positively correlated with the square of SOC strength and negatively correlated with the bandgap. The present work reveals the physical origin of valley polarization in altermagnets and expands the application of ferrovalley at room temperature in valleytronics.

# Quantum magnetometry of transient signals with a time resolution of 1.1 nanoseconds

## 时间分辨率为1.1纳秒的瞬态信号的量子磁测法

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05542

arXiv:2411.05542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magnetometers based on spin defects in solids enable sensitive imaging of various magnetic phenomena, such as ferro- and antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and current-induced fields. Existing protocols primarily focus on static fields or narrow-band dynamical signals, and are optimized for high sensitivity rather than fast time resolution. Here, we report detection of fast signal transients, providing a perspective for investigating the rich dynamics of magnetic systems. We experimentally demonstrate our technique using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometer at room temperature, reaching a best-effort time resolution of 1.1 ns, an instantaneous bandwidth of 0.9 GHz, and a time-of-flight precision better than 20 ps. The time resolution can be extended to the picosecond range by use of on-chip waveguides. At these speeds, NV quantum magnetometers will become competitive with time-resolved synchrotron X-ray techniques. Looking forward, adding fast temporal resolution to the spatial imaging capability further promotes single-spin probes as powerful research tools in spintronics, mesoscopic physics, and nanoscale device metrology.

# Understanding Streaming Instabilities in the Limit of High Cosmic Ray Current Density

## 了解高宇宙射线电流密度极限下的流不稳定性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05704

arXiv:2411.05704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical component of particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks is the non-resonant (Bell) instability, where the streaming of cosmic rays (CRs) leads to the amplification of magnetic fields necessary to scatter particles. In this work we use kinetic particle-in-cells simulations to investigate the high-CR current regime, where the typical assumptions underlying the Bell instability break down. Despite being more strongly driven, significantly less magnetic field amplification is observed compared to low-current cases, an effect due to the anisotropic heating that occurs in this regime. We also find that electron-scale modes, despite being fastest growing, mostly lead to moderate electron heating and do not affect the late evolution or saturation of the instability.

arXiv:2410.14370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for the design of magnonic transducers, where waveguide antennas generate and pick up spin-wave signals. Our method relies on the combination of circuit-level models with micromagnetic simulations and allows simulation of complex geometries in the magnonic domain. We validated our model with experimental measurements, which showed good agreement witch the predicted scattering parameters of the system. Using our model we identified scaling rules of the antenna radiation resistance and we show strategies to maximize transduction efficiency between the electric and magnetic domains. We designed a transducer pair on YIG with 5dB insertion loss in a 100 MHz band, an unusually low value for micron-scale spin-wave devices. This demonstrates that magnonic devices can be very efficient and competitive in RF applications.

# Prescreening of Liquid Density and Surface Tension for Synthetic Aviation Turbine Fuels by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Atom Types

## 通过核磁共振原子类型对合成航空涡轮燃料的液体密度和表面张力进行预屏

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-v3m2s?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Prescreening of Synthetic (“Sustainable”) Aviation Turbine Fuel, referred to as SAF in this work, is becoming regarded as an essential technique to secure the early-stage development of SAF candidates. Prescreening refers to the study of small volumes of SAF at the early stages of product development for the purpose of assessing the compatibility of the SAF candidate with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D4054 evaluation procedure for new aviation turbine fuels. The basis of the prescreening process relies on the availability of numerical models that can predict the fit-for-purpose properties of the ASTM evaluation procedure without the volumes of the SAF candidate needed to perform all the necessary measurements being available.
In this work, such models are developed that predict two important fit-for-purpose ASTM D4054 properties, the temperature dependent liquid density and temperature dependent surface tension of complex hydrocarbons mixtures. The basis of the method is the determination of atom type compositions by a 1H 13C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methodology. 
The dependence of each of, temperature dependent liquid density, and temperature dependent surface tension, on the range of atom types that comprise typical aviation fuel hydrocarbons is learned by the multiple linear regression modelling to a database of pure component and pure component mixture data gathered from the literature. A data base of 1,241 entries is gathered for density, and a data base of 1,260 entries gathered for surface. Each database is divided in an 80:20 ratio for model training and model testing. Extensive iterations of model training and testing objectively identify the same seven atom types as being most influential to each property. The collection of seven atom types, in addition to a temperature dependent term, is shown to be sufficient to determine each property quite precisely.
The models are then applied to the atom type compositions of two fossil-derived aviation fuels, four synthetic aviation fuels, and four reference gasoline fuels, as determined by 1H 13C HSQC NMR. The methodology shows high performance, predicting the unseen liquid density of these real fuels within an absolute error range of 0.00 – 5.59%, and surface tension within an absolute error range of 0.29 - 4.41%. It also successfully differentiates the relative magnitudes of each property across these fuels. This indicates that the method is valuable for prescreening applications.

# Field-dependent relaxation profiles of biomolecular systems

## 生物分子系统的场相关弛豫曲线

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-0x8b4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

The function of biomolecular systems, including biological macromolecules, often crucially depends on their dynamics. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is one of the most informative methods used to study biomolecules and their internal mobility, with atomic resolution, in near-physiological conditions.  NMR relaxation profiles, obtained from the field dependence of the nuclear relaxation rates, in particular, offer the possibility to probe dynamic processes over a wide range of time scales. Relaxation profiles are routinely acquired using field-cycling relaxometers operating at a maximum field of the order of 1 T. These measurements however suffer from a lack of resolution. On the other hand, relaxation rates measured at high magnetic fields contain poor information on motions on timescales longer than few nanoseconds. The possibility to acquire relaxation profiles extended to low fields but with high resolution, obtained by shuttling the sample back and forth in the stray field of a high-field spectrometer, is expected to dramatically improve the potentialities of NMR relaxometry. Here, we review investigations of relaxometry in a wide range of biomolecular systems, such as proteins, phospholipids, or biological fluids. Although multiple models of motions have been developed to describe the relaxation rates and their field dependence, most experimental investigations rely on the model-free approach. A variety of relaxation profiles of both diamagnetic and paramagnetic biomolecular systems are here reviewed and analysed using point dipole-point dipole interaction models.

# Idiopathic intraconal abscess: A case report of rare condition with a diagnostic dilemma

## 特发性脑内脓肿: 诊断困境的罕见病例报告

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5327756/latest

Background Intraconal abscess is a rare complication of rhino-sinusitis that could cause permanent visual loss. Orbital, especially intraconal involvement without any inciting event is a very rare occurrence.   Case Presentation: A 31-year-old male Ethiopian patient presented with 5 days history of painless protrusion of the right eye. Physical examination showed significantly decreased visual acuity is the right eye with very high intra-ocular pressure, significant proptosis, absent motility and high hyperopic shift. Laboratory investigations didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal any abnormalities, and orbital Computer Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging were suggestive of intra-orbital abscess collection. Surgical drainage of the abscess with lacrimal gland incisional biopsy was done and sent for histopathology, culture and sensitivity. Histopathology results showed mild inflammatory infiltrate of the lacrimal gland, and culture and Sensitivity revealed Coagulase-negative staphylococcus species sensitive for ciprofloxacin. After 3 days of intravenous antibiotics, it was changed to oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg three times per day and sent home. He had mild lid swelling and motility started to return to normal on his early post-operative follow-up with improvement on hyperopic shift. Subsequently, on follow-up, the patient had a near-normal visual acuity with complete resolution of hyperopia, full motility and no proptosis.   Conclusion Idiopathic intraconal abscess collection is an extremely rare presentation of patients with proptosis with significant diagnostic dilemma altering the course of treatment. Preoperative imaging followed by early surgical drainage and antibiotics is the definitive management that yields drastic improvement to the course of illness.

Background Right ventricular systolic dysfunction (RVD) is not well-understood in pediatric heart failure.Objectives To describe clinical and imaging features of children with isolated RVD and with biventricular dysfunction (BVD).Methods This is a retrospective single-center study evaluating patients (&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;21 years) with biventricular anatomy and RVD on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) between 2015&amp;ndash;2022. Echocardiographic, CMR, and clinical data were collected. We defined RVD as right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF)&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;45% on CMR, and RVEF&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;35% was considered severe RVD. Patients were grouped as having isolated RVD, or BVD if concurrent LVEF was &amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;50%. Logistic regression was used to investigate if RV fractional area change (FAC)&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;35%, qualitative RVD, and TAPSE Z-score by echocardiogram could predict severe RVD by CMR.Results Sixty-five patients were included, with a median age of 12.2 years. Thirty-two (49.2%) had isolated RVD, and 33 (50.8%) had BVD. Compared to BVD, patients with isolated RVD had higher RVEF (42.4% vs 36.9%, P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001), milder symptoms (96.9% vs 57.6% were NYHA I-II, P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001), and were less frequently on guideline-directed medical therapy (28.1% vs 48.5%, P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.036). Cardiac index (CI) was similar in both groups (2.9 vs. 2.4 ml/min/m2, P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.057). A combination of FAC&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;35% and qualitative RVD by echocardiogram best correlated with severe RVD by CMR (AUC: 0.83; Sensitivity: 72.7%, Specificity: 88.9%).Conclusion Compared with pediatric patients with BVD, those with isolated RVD are less symptomatic despite having a similarly low CI. The combined presence of abnormal FAC and qualitative RVD by echocardiogram correlated with severe RVD by CMR.

The interest of noncollinear spin structures in magnetic multilayers has recently gained a lot of interest in spintronics due to the observation of unique phenomena in these systems. In magnetic multilayers coupled by the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction the study of noncollinear interactions has gained interest. In this paper, we study the magnetization reversal of two magnetic layers with different magnetic anisotropy directions coupled by the RKKY interaction. We have chosen Pt/Co/Ru/Co40Fe40B20 structures where the Pt/Co show perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and CoFeB show an in-plane magnetic anisotropy.

# Innovative design and nonlinear stability analysis of a micro giant magnetostrictive bone conduction vibrator

## 微型超磁致伸缩骨传导振子的创新设计及非线性稳定性分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5270009/latest

Due to the excellent energy conversion engineering characteristics of giant magnetostrictive material (GMM), a giant magnetostrictive bone conduction micro-vibrator is proposed and designed. Base on the linear piezomagnetic equation and the structural dynamics of the GMM bone conduction vibrator, a hysteresis nonlinear dynamic equation for the GMM bone conduction vibrator is derived. Following the application of a dimensionless treatment to the equation, an analysis of the vibrator's main resonance is conducted using a multi-scale method. The chaotic characteristics of the system is examined via both qualitative and quantitative analysis, with particular attention paid to the influences of excitation amplitude and frequency. The results show that the dimensions of the designed excitation coil module is &oslash;5.5&times;7.15mm, with the overall contour size of the GMM vibrator being as small as &oslash;17&times;19mm. This meets the miniaturization design requirements of the bone conduction vibrator. A smaller excitation amplitude or a larger damping coefficient is beneficial for reducing the unstable branch of the primary resonance and avoiding the amplitude jump. An appropriate secondary stiffness coefficient is helpful for offsetting the influence of nonlinear factors on the system. Under the condition of given parameters, the GMM bone conduction vibrator exhibits chaotic behaviour, and avoiding its chaotic region can effectively improve the stability of the system.

# Arterial pulsations and transmantle pressure synergetically drive glymphatic flow

## 动脉搏动和跨地幔压力协同驱动淋巴血流

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5257018/latest

Clearance of waste material from the brain by the glymphatic system results from net flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through perivascular spaces surrounding veins and arteries. In periarterial spaces, this bulk flow is directed from the cranial subarachnoid space towards the brain&rsquo;s interior. The precise pumping mechanism explaining this net inflow remains unclear. While &nbsp;in vivo experiments have shown that the pulsatile motion in periarterial spaces is synchronized with arterial pulsations, peristalsis alone has been deemed insufficient to explain bulk flow. In this study we examine an alternative mechanism based on the interaction between arterial pulsations and fluctuations in transmantle pressure. Previously studied using pressure data from a hydrocephalus patient, this mechanism is analyzed here in healthy subjects using &nbsp;in vivo flow measurements obtained via phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. Arterial pulsations are derived from flow-rate measurements of arterial blood entering the cranial cavity, while transmantle-pressure fluctuations are computed using measurements of CSF flow in the cerebral aqueduct. The two synchronized waveforms are integrated into a canonical multi-branch model of the periarterial spaces, yielding a closed-form expression for the bulk flow. The results confirm that the dynamic interactions between arterial pulsations and transmantle pressure are sufficient to generate a positive inflow along periarterial spaces.
