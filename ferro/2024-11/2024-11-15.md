# Resonant second harmonic generation in a two-dimensional electron system

## 二维电子系统中的共振二次谐波产生

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08947

arXiv:2411.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear response of a disordered two-dimensional electronic system, lacking inversion symmetry, to an external alternating electric field. The application of an in-plane static magnetic field induces local contributions to the current density that are quadratic in the electric field and linear in the magnetic field. This current oscillates at twice the frequency of the external irradiation and there are two linearly independent vector combinations that contribute to the current density. This particular mechanism coexists with the topological Berry-dipole contribution to the second harmonic of the current density, which can be generated by quantum confinement. Additional nonlocal terms in the current density are possible in the regime away from the normal incidence. The total current exhibits a nonreciprocal character upon reversal of the magnetic field direction. We evaluate the magnitude of this effect by computing its dependence on the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the disorder scattering rate. Importantly, we show that these local second-harmonic contributions can be resonantly excited when the frequency of the external radiation approaches the energy separation between the spin-orbit split bands.

Abstract: We adapt the topological quantum chemistry formalism to layer groups, and apply it to study the band topology of 8,872 entries from the computational two-dimensional (2D) materials databases C2DB and MC2D. In our analysis, we find 4,073 topologically non-trivial or obstructed atomic insulator entries, including 905 topological insulators, 602 even-electron number topological semimetals, and 1,003 obstructed atomic insulators. We thus largely expand the library of known topological or obstructed materials in two dimensions, beyond the few hundreds known to date. We additionally classify the materials into four categories: experimentally existing, stable, computationally exfoliated, and not stable. We present a detailed analysis of the edge states emerging in a number of selected new materials, and compile a Topological 2D Materials Database (2D-TQCDB) containing the band structures and detailed topological properties of all the materials studied in this work. The methodology here developed is implemented in new programs available to the public, designed to study the topology of any non-magnetic monolayer or multilayer 2D material.

# Orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in 2H-NbS2 flakes

## 2H-NbS2薄片中的轨道fulde-ferrell-larkin-ovchinnikov状态

arXiv:2411.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking in a layered superconductor with Ising spin-orbit coupling has offered an opportunity to realize unconventional superconductivity. To be more specific, orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, exhibiting layer-dependent finite-momentum pairing, may emerge in transition metal dichalcogenides materials (TMDC) in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Orbital FFLO state can be more robust against the magnetic field than the conventional superconducting state with zero-momentum pairing. This feature renders its potential in field resilient superconducting functionality. Although, orbital FFLO state has been reported in NbSe2 and MoS2, it is not yet clear if orbital FFLO state can be a general feature of TMDC superconductor. Here, we report the observation of orbital FFLO state in 2H-NbS2 flakes and its dependence on the thickness of flake. We conclude that the relatively weak interlayer coupling is instrumental in stabilizing orbital FFLO state at higher temperature with respect to the critical temperature and lower magnetic field with respect to paramagnetic limit in NbS2 in comparison to its NbSe2 counterpart.

# Anisotropic transverse magnetoresistance temperature dependence in Mn3Ga Weyl semimetal with chiral anomaly

arXiv:2411.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal antiferromagnetic D019-Mn3X (X = Sn, Ge, Ga) compounds, with a non-collinear Kagome spin structure, are Weyl semimetals exhibiting novel topological transport properties. The longitudinal magnetoresistance of c-oriented epitaxial Ru/Mn3Ga thin films exhibits a positive quadratic dependence on magnetic field over a wide range of temperatures. Here we describe the transverse magnetoresistance, with the field in the out-of-plane direction, for c-oriented epitaxial GaN (0001)/Mn3Ga films. There is a transition from a negative linear to a positive quadratic dependence on magnetic field in the temperature range from 200 K to 300 K. The electrical resistivity shows a metallic to semiconductor transition at 230 K. By applying the electric field along two perpendicular in-plane directions we find asymmetry in the magnetoresistance curves due to self-spin polarized currents created through magnetic octupole clusters. First principles calculations confirmed the metallic to semiconductor transition corresponds to reordering the spin structure to a higher symmetry configuration.

# Magnetic response of topological insulator layer with metamaterial substrate induced by an electric point source

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09103

arXiv:2411.09103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with unique surface conductive properties that distinguish them from normal insulators and have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in electronics and spintronics. However, their weak magnetic field response in traditional setups has limited practical applications. Here, we show that integrating TIs with active metamaterial substrates can significantly enhance the induced magnetic field by more than 10^4 times. Our results demonstrate that selecting specific permittivity and permeability values for the active metamaterial substrate optimizes the magnetic field at the interface between the TI layer and the metamaterial, extending into free space. This represents a substantial improvement over previous methods, where the magnetic field decayed rapidly. The findings reveal that the TI-metamaterial approach enhances the magnetic field response, unveiling new aspects of TI electromagnetic behavior and suggesting novel pathways for developing materials with tailored electromagnetic properties. The integration of metamaterials with TIs offers promising opportunities for advancements in materials science and various technological applications. Overall, our study provides a practical and effective approach to exploring the unique magnetic field responses of TIs, potentially benefiting other complex material systems.

# Nonlinear Hall Effect in KTaO$_3$ Two-Dimensional Electron Gases

## KTaO $_3 $ 二维电子气中的非线性霍尔效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09161

arXiv:2411.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of a Hall effect, a finite transverse voltage induced by a longitudinal current, usually requires the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, for example through the application of an external magnetic field or the presence of long range magnetic order in a sample. Recently it was suggested that under certain symmetry conditions, the presence of finite Berry curvatures in the band structure of a system with time-reversal symmetry but without inversion symmetry can give rise to a nonlinear Hall effect in the presence of a probe current. In order to observe the nonlinear Hall effect, one requires a finite component of a so-called Berry dipole along the direction of the probe current. We report here measurements of the nonlinear Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases fabricated on the surface of KTaO$_3$ with different surface crystal orientations as a function of the probe current, a transverse electric field and back gate voltage. For all three crystal orientations, the transverse electric field modifies the nonlinear Hall effect. We discuss our results in the context of the current understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect as well as potential experimental artifacts that may give rise to the same effects.

# Multiphase superconductivity in PdBi2

## PdBi2中的多相超导电性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09239

arXiv:2411.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity, where electron pairing does not involve electron-phonon interactions, is often attributed to magnetic correlations in a material. Well known examples include high-T_c cuprates and uranium-based heavy fermion superconductors. Less explored are unconventional superconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, where interactions between spin-polarised electrons and external magnetic field can result in multiple superconducting phases and field-induced transitions between them, a rare phenomenon in the superconducting state. Here we report a magnetic-field driven phase transition in \beta-PdBi2, a layered non-magnetic superconductor. Our tunnelling spectroscopy on thin PdBi2 monocrystals incorporated in planar superconductor-insulator-normal metal junctions reveals a marked discontinuity in the superconducting properties with increasing in-plane field, which is consistent with a transition from conventional (s-wave) to nodal pairing. Our theoretical analysis suggests that this phase transition may arise from spin polarisation and spin-momentum locking caused by locally broken inversion symmetry, with p-wave pairing becoming energetically favourable in high fields. Our findings also reconcile earlier predictions of unconventional multigap superconductivity in \beta-PdBi2 with previous experiments where only a single s-wave gap could be detected.

# Emergent inductors in non-helical magnets

## 非螺旋磁体中的紧急电感器

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09253

arXiv:2411.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent inductor, which is a concept of inductor employing quantum mechanics on helical magnets, has been studied actively from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Interestingly, finite inductance has been observed not only in spiral magnetic phases but also across various other magnetic phases although the underlying mechanism behind emergent inductance in non-helical magnets remains unresolved. In this study, we broaden the concept of emergent inductance to encompass non-helical magnets and establish a comprehensive formalism of the emergent inductance generated by magnetization dynamics. Using a diagrammatic approach, we derive the linear response of current density mediated by magnetization dynamics and formulate impedance and inductance for general magnetic materials. We reveal that the emergent inductance is composed of two distinct components, each contributing positively or negatively. Notably, the positive inductance arises from Ohmic dissipation including the effect of the emergent electric field (Berry phase in real space) while the negative inductance arises from the polarization of itinerant electrons (Berry curvature in $k$-$t$ space). We also apply the present method to quasi 1D models and show the numerical results of the inductance, the spin dynamics, the impedance, and the Q-value.

arXiv:2411.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent theoretical studies have positioned noncollinear polar magnets with $C_{nv}$ symmetry as compelling candidates for realizing topological magnetic phases and substantial intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, experimental realizations of the same in strongly correlated systems remain rare. Here, we present a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect and extended topological magnetic ordering in Gd$_3$Ni$_8$Sn$_4$ with hexagonal $C_{6v}$ symmetry. Observation of topological Hall response, corroborated by metamagnetic anomalies in isothermal magnetization, peak/hump features in field-evolution of ac susceptibility and longitudinal resistivity, attests to the stabilization of skyrmion $A$-phase. The anomalous Hall effect is quantitatively accounted for by the intrinsic Berry curvature-mediated mechanism. Our results underscore polar magnets as a promising platform to investigate a plethora of emergent electrodynamic responses rooted in the interplay between magnetism and topology.

# Gapped Spin Excitation in Magnetic Ordered State on Yb-Based Zigzag Chain Compound YbAgSe2

Abstract: We report the 77Se-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results of trivalent Yb zigzag chain compound YbAgSe2, which is a sister compound of YbCuS2. The 77Se-NMR spectrum was reproduced by considering two different Se sites with negative Knight shifts and three-axis anisotropy. Above the Neel temperature TN, the Knight shift is proportional to the bulk magnetic susceptibility. Below TN, the extremely broad signal with weak intensity and the relatively sharp signal coexist, suggesting that one is strongly influenced by internal magnetic fields and the other remains relatively unaffected by these fields in the magnetic ordered state. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 remains almost constant above TN and abruptly decreases below TN. In contrast to YbCuS2, a T-linear behavior of 1/T1 at low temperatures was not observed at least down to 1.0 K in YbAgSe2. Our results indicate that the gapless excitation is unique to YbCuS2, or is immediately suppressed in the magnetic fields.

arXiv:2411.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semi-analytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As an illustration of their capabilities, we demonstrate that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.

arXiv:2411.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exfoliation and stacking of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals have created unprecedented opportunities in the discovery of quantum phases. A major obstacle to the advancement of this field is the limited spectroscopic access due to a mismatch in sample sizes (1 - 10 micrometer) and wavelengths (0.1 - 1 millimeter) of electromagnetic radiation relevant to their low-energy excitations. Here, we introduce a new member of the 2D vdW material family: a terahertz (THz) emitter. We show intense and broadband THz generation from the vdW ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI2 with optical rectification efficiency over one-order-of-magnitude higher than that of the current standard THz emitter, ZnTe. The NbOI2 THz emitter can be easily integrated into vdW heterostructures for on-chip near-field THz spectroscopy of a target vdW material/device. Our approach provides a general spectroscopic tool for the rapidly expanding field of 2D vdW materials and quantum matter.

Abstract: We have analytically explored both the zero temperature and the finite temperature scaling theory for the collapse of an attractively interacting 3-D harmonically trapped Bose gas in a synthetic magnetic field. We have considered short ranged (contact) attractive inter-particle interactions and Hartree-Fock approximation for the same. We have separately studied the collapse of both the condensate and the thermal cloud below and above the condensation point, respectively. We have obtained an anisotropy, artificial magnetic field, and temperature dependent critical number of particles for the collapse of the condensate. We have found a dramatic change in the critical exponent (from $\alpha=1$ to $0$) of the specific heat ($C_v\propto|T-T_c|^{\alpha}$) when the thermal cloud is about to collapse with the critical number of particles ($N=N_c$) just below and above the condensation point. All the results obtained by us are experimentally testable within the present-day experimental set-up for the ultracold systems in the magneto-optical traps.

Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6{\AA} to 27.2{\AA} after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.

# Magnetization process of a quasi-two-dimensional quantum magnet: Two-step symmetry restoration and dimensional reduction

## 准二维量子磁体的磁化过程: 两步对称恢复和降维

arXiv:2411.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a comprehensive thermodynamic study of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) quantum magnet Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Br which in the 2D layer can be viewed as strongly coupled alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic chains. In an applied magnetic field transverse to the ordered spins below $T_N=9.3$ K, a field-induced phase transition from the 3D ordered to a disordered phase occurs at $B_c=16.3$ T for the lowest temperature, which is featured by an onset of a one-half plateau-like magnetization. By performing quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the relevant 2D model, we find that the plateau-like magnetization corresponds to a partial symmetry restoration and the full polarization in the ferromagnetic chains. Our numerical simulations also show that the magnetization saturation occurs with full symmetry restoration at a much higher field of $B_s \simeq 95$ T, corresponding to a 1D quantum phase transition in the antiferromagnetic chains. We argue that the experimentally observed field-induced phase transition at $B_c$ follows from the partial symmetry restoration and the concomitant dimensional reduction.

# Origin of the suppression of magnetic order in MnSi under hydrostatic pressure

## 静水压力下MnSi磁序抑制的起源

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09569

arXiv:2411.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the evolution of the magnetic moment $m$ and exchange interaction $J$ as a function of hydrostatic pressure in the zero-field helimagnetic phase of the strongly correlated electron system MnSi. The suppression of magnetic order at $\approx 1.5$~GPa is shown to arise from the $J$ collapse and not from a quantum fluctuations induced reduction of $m$. Our work provides benchmarks for first principles theories that are challenged by the presence of strong correlations and the possible role of Hund's coupling. In addition, our experimental data are consistent with a reorientation of the magnetic propagation wavevector recently evidenced above $\approx 1.2$~GPa. This result calls for a thorough investigation of the crystal structure in this pressure range.

# On the Ferrimagnetic State of CrCl$_2$(pyz)$_2$

arXiv:2411.09662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals layered ferromagnetic compounds with high two-dimensional electronic conductivity holds strong potential for quantum computing, future unconventional superconductors, catalysts, batteries, and fuel cells. We suggest a minimal theoretical model to understand the magnetic properties of the metal-organic framework CrCl$_2$(pyz)$_2$ (pyz=pyrazine). Using a Hubbard model we show that the groundstate is dominated by a specific configuration of delocalized electrons on the pyz sites with a ferrimagnetic coupling to the localized spins on the Cr sites. This model suggests a magnetic moment of $2\mu_B$ which is remarkably close to the experimental value of $1.8 \mu_B$ [K. S. Pedersen et al., Nat. Chem. 10, 1056-1061 (2018)]. From Weiss mean-field theory we predict a weak ferromagnetic Cr-Cr coupling of $\approx 0.9$ meV. This is consolidated by second order perturbation theory of the RKKY interaction yielding a Cr-Cr coupling of $\approx 5$ meV. Understanding the interactions in these types of compounds can facilitate designs of metal-organic compounds with tailored magnetic properties.

arXiv:2411.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoe- mission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.

Abstract: It is shown theoretically how to use the EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) technique, using electron spins as qubits, coupled with each other by the exchange interaction, to set the configuration of n qubits (n=1,2,3,4) at resonance, in conjunction with pulses, to construct the NOT (one qubit), CNOT (two qubits), CCNOT (three qubits), CCCNOT (four qubits) Toffoli gates, which can be exploited to build a quantum computer. This is unique to EPR, wherein exchange-coupled electron spins are used. This is not possible with NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), that uses nuclear spins as qubits, which do not couple with each other by the exchange interaction.

# Weak Poincar\'e Inequalities, Simulated Annealing, and Sampling from Spherical Spin Glasses

arXiv:2411.09075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of powerful tools to show rapid mixing of Markov chains, via functional inequalities such as Poincar\'e inequalities. In many situations, Markov chains fail to mix rapidly from a worst-case initialization, yet are expected to approximately sample from a random initialization. For example, this occurs if the target distribution has metastable states, small clusters accounting for a vanishing fraction of the mass that are essentially disconnected from the bulk of the measure. Under such conditions, a Poincar\'e inequality cannot hold, necessitating new tools to prove sampling guarantees. We develop a framework to analyze simulated annealing, based on establishing so-called weak Poincar\'e inequalities. These inequalities imply mixing from a suitably warm start, and simulated annealing provides a way to chain such warm starts together into a sampling algorithm. We further identify a local-to-global principle to prove weak Poincar\'e inequalities, mirroring the spectral independence and localization schemes frameworks for analyzing mixing times of Markov chains.
  As our main application, we prove that simulated annealing samples from the Gibbs measure of a spherical spin glass for inverse temperatures up to a natural threshold, matching recent algorithms based on algorithmic stochastic localization. This provides the first Markov chain sampling guarantee that holds beyond the uniqueness threshold for spherical spin glasses, where mixing from a worst-case initialization is provably slow. As an ingredient in our proof, we prove bounds on the operator norm of the covariance matrix of spherical spin glasses in the full replica-symmetric regime.
  Additionally, we resolve questions related to the mixing of Glauber dynamics in the ferromagnetic Potts model from a uniform monochromatic coloring, and sampling using data-based initializations.

# Catalog of Unconventional Magnons in Collinear Magnets

arXiv:2307.12366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological magnons have garnered significant interest for their potential in both fundamental research and device applications, owing to their exotic, uncharged, yet topologically protected boundary modes. However, their comprehension has been hindered by the absence of fundamental symmetry descriptions of magnetic materials, which are primarily governed by isotropic Heisenberg interactions in spin Hamiltonians. The ensuing magnon dispersions enable gapless magnon band nodes that go beyond the scenario of representation theory of the magnetic space groups (MSGs), thus referred to as unconventional magnons. Here we developed spin space group (SSG) theory to elucidate collinear magnetic configurations, classifying the 1421 collinear SSGs into four types, constructing their band representations, and providing a comprehensive tabulation of unconventional magnons, such as duodecuple points, octuple nodal lines, and charge-4 octuple points. Based on the MAGNDATA database, we identified 498 collinear magnets with unconventional magnons, among which over 200 magnon band structures were obtained by using first-principles calculations and linear spin wave theory. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of the spin-orbit coupling-induced exchange interaction in these magnets and found that more than 80% are predominantly governed by the Heisenberg interactions, indicating that SSG serves as an ideal framework for describing magnon band nodes in most 3d, 4d and half-filled 4f collinear magnets. Our work offers new pathways for exploring uncharged transports in magnonic systems, holding promise for advancements in next-generation spintronic devices.

# Emergence of high-mobility carriers in topological kagome bad metal Mn$_3$Sn by intense photoexcitation

Abstract: Kagome-lattice materials offer novel playgrounds of exploring topologically nontrivial states of electrons under influence of many-body interactions. A noncollinear kagome antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn has attracted particular interest for application in spintronics owing to the large anomalous Hall effect related to the Weyl dispersion near the Fermi energy. In addition, strong electronic correlation suggesting the Kondo physics has also been implied. However, the effect of correlation on the band topology and their interplay remains elusive. Here, we investigate nonequilibrium Hall transport in a photoexcited Mn$_3$Sn using time-resolved terahertz Faraday rotation spectroscopy. In equilibrium, Mn$_3$Sn is a bad metal close to the Mott-Ioffe-Regal limit with low carrier mobility, and thus only the anomalous Hall effect is discerned. By contrast, intense photoexcitation beyond an approximate threshold gives rise to a clear cyclotron resonance, namely the normal Hall effect, indicating the emergence of unusual carriers with 50 times lighter effective mass and 40 times less scattering. The lifetime of high-mobility carriers as long as a few tens of picoseconds and a threshold-like behavior for the pump fluence are hardly explained by contribution of photoexcited hot carriers. Instead, the emergence of unusual carriers may be accounted for by dielectric screening of the on-site Coulomb interaction by high-density delocalized photocarriers. A possible role of electronic correlation in equilibrium transport in Mn$_3$Sn beyond the single-particle picture is discussed.

Abstract: Developing a comprehensive magnetic theory for correlated itinerant magnets poses challenges due to the difficulty in reconciling both local moments and itinerant electrons. In this work, we investigate the microscopic process of magnetic phase transition in ferromagnetic metal Fe$_{3-\delta}$GeTe$_2$. We find that Hund's coupling is crucial for establishing ferromagnetic order. During the ferromagnetic transition, we observe the formation of quasiparticle flat bands and an opposing tendency in spectral weight transfer, primarily between the lower and upper Hubbard bands, across the two spin channels. Moreover, our results indicate that one of the inequivalent Fe sites exhibits Mott physics, while the other Fe site exhibits Hund's physics, attributable to their distinct atomic environments. We suggest that ferromagnetic order reduces spin fluctuations and makes flat bands near the Fermi level more distinct. The hybridization between the distinctly flat bands and other itinerant bands offers a possible way to form heavy fermion behavior in ferromagnets. The complex interactions of competing orders drive correlated magnetic metals to a new frontier for discovering outstanding quantum states.

Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems with Galilean invariance gapped under magnetic fields. When such quantum Hall systems are coupled with external sources for charge, energy, and momentum currents, they exhibit invariance under the Milne boost as well as under the gauge and general coordinate transformations. We construct the most general effective action consistent with all the symmetries in the derivative expansion, where an electric field is regarded as order of unity so as to allow for nonlinear responses. The resulting action is shown to consist of four terms proportional to the Hall conductivity and viscosity and the energy density and magnetization. We then compute the local currents induced by electromagnetic fields, revealing universal relations among distinct kinds of responses. In particular, we find the Hall conductivity determining the longitudinal conductivity at nonzero frequency and the Hall viscosity contributing to the nonlinear electrothermal conductivity at nonzero wave number.

Abstract: Monolayer NiI$_2$ garners large research interest due to its multiferroic behavior stemming from the interplay between its non-collinear magnetic order and the spin-orbit coupling. This prompts an investigation into the stability of the magnetic order in NiI$_2$ and similar materials under external stimuli. In this work, we report the effect of biaxial and uniaxial strain on the magnetic ground state, the critical temperature, and the magnonic properties of the NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br, Cl) monolayers. For all three materials, we reveal intricate strain-dependent phase diagrams, including ferromagnetic, helimagnetic, and skyrmionic phases. Moreover, we discuss the necessity of considering the biquadratic exchange interaction in the latter analysis. We reveal that the biquadratic exchange significantly alters both the magnetic ground state and the critical temperature of the magnetic order, and we demonstrate that its importance becomes even more explicit when monolayer Ni-dihalides are strained. Finally, we calculate the magnonic dispersion for the predicted magnetic states, showing that the skyrmionic phase functions as a magnonic crystal, and demonstrate the presence of strain-tunable soft magnon modes at finite wavevectors in the helimagnetic phase.

# Spin Hall and Edelstein Effects in Novel Chiral Noncollinear Altermagnets

arXiv:2410.17993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a newly discovered class of magnetic phases that combine the spin polarization behavior of ferromagnetic band structures with the vanishing net magnetization characteristic of antiferromagnets. Initially proposed for collinear magnets, the concept has since been extended to include certain non-collinear structures. A recent development in Landau theory for collinear altermagnets incorporates spin-space symmetries, providing a robust framework for identifying this class of materials. Here we expand on that theory to identify altermagnetic multipolar order parameters in non-collinear chiral materials. We demonstrate that the interplay between non-collinear altermagnetism and chirality allows for spatially odd multipole components, leading to non-trivial spin textures on Fermi surfaces and unexpected transport phenomena, even in the absence of SOC. This makes such chiral altermagnets fundamentally different from the well-known SOC-driven Rashba-Edelstein and spin Hall effects used for 2D spintronics. Choosing the chiral topological magnetic material Mn$_3$IrSi as a case study, we apply toy models and first-principles calculations to predict experimental signatures, such as large spin-Hall and Edelstein effects, that have not been previously observed in altermagnets. These findings pave the way for a new realm of spintronics applications based on spin-transport properties of chiral altermagnets.

arXiv:2411.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in precision nanofabrication and atomic design over the past 50 years has ushered in a succession of transformative eras for molding the generation and flow of light. The use of nanoscale and atomic features to design light sources and optical elements-encapsulated by the term nanophotonics-has led to new fundamental science and innovative technologies across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with substantial emphasis on the microwave to visible regimes. In this review, we pay special attention to the impact and potential of nanophotonics in a relatively exotic yet technologically disruptive regime: high-energy particles such as X-ray photons and free electrons-where nanostructures and atomic design open the doors to unprecedented technologies in quantum science and versatile X-ray sources and optics. As the practical generation of X-rays is intrinsically linked to the existence of energetic free or quasi-free-electrons, our review will also capture related phenomena and technologies that combine free electrons with nanophotonics, including free-electron-driven nanophotonics at other photon energies. In particular, we delve into the demonstration and study of quantum recoil in the X-ray regime, the study of nanomaterial design and free-electron wave shaping as means to enhance and control X-ray radiation, examine the free-electron generation enabled by nanophotonics, and analyze the high-harmonic generation by quasi-free electrons. We also discuss applications of quantum nanophotonics for X-rays and free electrons, including nanostructure waveguides for X-rays, photon pair enhanced X-ray imaging, mirrors, and lenses for X-rays, among others.

arXiv:2411.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at a heliospheric termination shock is investigated. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation, accelerated pickup ions are self-consistently reproduced by tracking long time evolution of shock with unprecedentedly large system size in the shock normal direction. Reflected pickup ions drive upstream large amplitude waves through resonant instabilities. Convection of the large amplitude waves causes shock surface reformation and alters the downstream electromagnetic structure. A part of pickup ions are accelerated to tens of upstream flow energy in the time scale of $\sim 100$ times inverse ion gyro frequency. The initial acceleration occurs through shock surfing acceleration mechanism followed by shock drift acceleration mechanism. Large electrostatic potential accompanied by the upstream waves enables the shock surfing acceleration to occur.

arXiv:2411.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces -- ultrathin structures composed of subwavelength optical elements -- have revolutionized light manipulation by enabling precise control over electromagnetic waves' amplitude, phase, polarization, and spectral properties. Concurrently, computational imaging leverages algorithms to reconstruct images from optically processed signals, overcoming limitations of traditional imaging systems. This review explores the synergistic integration of metaoptics and computational imaging, "computational metaoptics," which combines the physical wavefront shaping ability of metasurfaces with advanced computational algorithms to enhance imaging performance beyond conventional limits. We discuss how computational metaoptics addresses the inherent limitations of single-layer metasurfaces in achieving multifunctionality without compromising efficiency. By treating metasurfaces as physical preconditioners and co-designing them with reconstruction algorithms through end-to-end (inverse) design, it is possible to jointly optimize the optical hardware and computational software. This holistic approach allows for the automatic discovery of optimal metasurface designs and reconstruction methods that significantly improve imaging capabilities. Advanced applications enabled by computational metaoptics are highlighted, including phase imaging and quantum state measurement, which benefit from the metasurfaces' ability to manipulate complex light fields and the computational algorithms' capacity to reconstruct high-dimensional information. We also examine performance evaluation challenges, emphasizing the need for new metrics that account for the combined optical and computational nature of these systems. Finally, we identify new frontiers in computational metaoptics which point toward a future where computational metaoptics may play a central role in advancing imaging science and technology.

Abstract: Global attention has been focused on extreme climatic changes. This paper investigates the relationship between different phases of solar activity and extreme precipitation events in Kerala, India. Sunspot number and rainfall data were analysed over 122 years (1901-2022) on an annual scale. A negative correlation was observed in the winter and post-monsoon seasons, while positive correlations were seen in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, all of which were statistically significant. Using cross-wavelet transform, the temporal relationship between sunspot number and rainfall values was investigated, revealing significant cross-power at an 8-12 year scale across all seasons. Wavelet coherence between the two data sets demonstrated significant correlation at the 2-4 and 4-8 year scales throughout the four seasons. The results show that the seasonal rainfall over Kerala is related to solar activity. The solar phases of Solar Cycles 14-24 were determined for all seasons, and the years with excessive and insufficient rainfall were identified. It was observed that the descending phase had an impact on excess rainfall events during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons, while the ascending phase notably affected the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The study specifically examined the different magnetic polarities of sunspots in alternating solar cycles, focusing on even and odd cycles. It was found that extreme rainfall events were more frequent during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons in the even cycles, whereas in the odd cycles, they were more prevalent during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. These findings are presented for the first time and may offer new perspectives on how different phases affect rainfall. This study suggests a physical link between solar activity and extreme precipitation in Kerala, which could increase predictability.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal di-chalcogenide layers with high electrical conductivity and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can find huge potential in spintronic devices. With limited success of 2D spin Hall material development, we demonstrate vanadium (V) substitutionally doped monolayer MoS2 (VMS) as a potential spin Hall material having tunable electrical conductivity, SOC strength, and room temperature magnetism. Systematic enhancement in the electrical conductivity is observed with the extent of V doping, where it is enhanced from ~0.3 S/m of MoS2 to ~100000 S/m upon doping to the level of 9 atomic%. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) based spin-pumping experiments indicate the spin transport across the junction of permalloy (Py) and VMS. Spin-torque FMR measurements demonstrate the suggesting latter's potential as a spin-orbit torque layer in 2D spintronic devices.

arXiv:2411.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: School and undergraduate students are almost always taught the equations of electromagnetism using a set of conventions that are described as the SI. More advanced students are often introduced to different conventions that produce different equations for the same relationships, using either the Gaussian or Heaviside-Lorentz systems. In general, the connection between these equations is not simple. However, if the basis of each system is understood, conversion from SI equations to either Gaussian or Heaviside-Lorentz ones is very straightforward. The reverse processes are less straightforward, but more comprehensible when the fundamental differences are understood. Simple methods for these processes are presented, using a novel application of dimensional analysis, without factors of (square root (epsilon0)) appearing. It is also shown that when different physical quantities are given different symbols, and these are used consistently, the SI can be seen to provide general equations, with the Gaussian and Heaviside-Lorentz ones being simplifications of them. This removes any need for system-independent versions of electromagnetic equations, with additional parameters that take different values in the different systems, which have been proposed in various forms over many decades.

Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with unique surface conductive properties that distinguish them from normal insulators and have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in electronics and spintronics. However, their weak magnetic field response in traditional setups has limited practical applications. Here, we show that integrating TIs with active metamaterial substrates can significantly enhance the induced magnetic field by more than 10^4 times. Our results demonstrate that selecting specific permittivity and permeability values for the active metamaterial substrate optimizes the magnetic field at the interface between the TI layer and the metamaterial, extending into free space. This represents a substantial improvement over previous methods, where the magnetic field decayed rapidly. The findings reveal that the TI-metamaterial approach enhances the magnetic field response, unveiling new aspects of TI electromagnetic behavior and suggesting novel pathways for developing materials with tailored electromagnetic properties. The integration of metamaterials with TIs offers promising opportunities for advancements in materials science and various technological applications. Overall, our study provides a practical and effective approach to exploring the unique magnetic field responses of TIs, potentially benefiting other complex material systems.

Abstract: Exfoliation and stacking of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals have created unprecedented opportunities in the discovery of quantum phases. A major obstacle to the advancement of this field is the limited spectroscopic access due to a mismatch in sample sizes (1 - 10 micrometer) and wavelengths (0.1 - 1 millimeter) of electromagnetic radiation relevant to their low-energy excitations. Here, we introduce a new member of the 2D vdW material family: a terahertz (THz) emitter. We show intense and broadband THz generation from the vdW ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI2 with optical rectification efficiency over one-order-of-magnitude higher than that of the current standard THz emitter, ZnTe. The NbOI2 THz emitter can be easily integrated into vdW heterostructures for on-chip near-field THz spectroscopy of a target vdW material/device. Our approach provides a general spectroscopic tool for the rapidly expanding field of 2D vdW materials and quantum matter.

arXiv:2411.09605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit temporal discretization of particle-in-cell schemes for the Vlasov equation that results in exact energy conservation when combined with an appropriate spatial discretization. The scheme is inspired by a simple, second-order explicit scheme that conserves energy exactly in the Eulerian context. We show that direct translation to particle-in-cell does not result in strict conservation, but derive a simple correction based on an analytically solvable optimization problem that recovers conservation. While this optimization problem is not guaranteed to have a real solution for every particle, we provide a correction that makes imaginary values extremely rare and still admits $\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})$ fractional errors in energy for practical simulation parameters. We present the scheme in both electrostatic -- where we use the Amp\`{e}re formulation -- and electromagnetic contexts. With an electromagnetic field solve, the field update is most naturally linearly implicit, but the more computationally intensive particle update remains fully explicit. We also show how the scheme can be extended to use the fully explicit leapfrog and pseudospectral analytic time-domain (PSATD) field solvers. The scheme is tested on standard kinetic plasma problems, confirming its conservation properties.

arXiv:2411.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are strong arguments that quantum mechanics may be nonlinear in its dynamics. A discovery of nonlinearity would hint at a novel understanding of the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory, for example. As such, experiments searching for potential nonlinear effects in the electromagnetic sector are important. Here we outline such an experiment, consisting of a stream of random bits (which were generated using Rigetti's Aspen-M-3 chip) as input to an RF signal generator coupled to a cryogenic detector. Projective measurements of the qubit state, which is originally prepared in an equal superposition, serve as the random binary output of a signal generator. Thereafter, spectral analysis of the RF detector would yield a detectable excess signal predicted to arise from such a nonlinear effect. A comparison between the projective measurements of the quantum bits vs the classical baseline showed no power excess. This sets a new limit on the electromagnetic nonlinearity parameter $|\epsilon| \lessapprox 1.15 \times 10^{-12}$, at a 90.0% confidence level. This is the most stringent limit on nonlinear quantum mechanics thus far and an improvement by nearly a factor of 50 over the previous experimental limit.

Abstract: Highly excited Rydberg states and their interactions play an important role in quantum computing and simulation. These properties can be predicted accurately for alkali atoms with simple Rydberg level structures. However, an extension of these methods to more complex atoms such as alkaline-earth atoms has not been demonstrated or experimentally validated. Here, we present multichannel quantum defect (MQDT) models for highly excited $^{174}$Yb and $^{171}$Yb Rydberg states with $L \leq 2$. The models are developed using a combination of existing literature data and new, high-precision laser and microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, and validated by detailed comparison with experimentally measured Stark shifts and magnetic moments. We then use these models to compute interaction potentials between two Yb atoms, and find excellent agreement with direct measurements in an optical tweezer array. From the computed interaction potential, we identify an anomalous F\"orster resonance that likely degraded the fidelity of previous entangling gates in $^{171}$Yb using $F=3/2$ Rydberg states. We then identify a more suitable $F=1/2$ state, and achieve a state-of-the-art controlled-Z gate fidelity of $F=0.994(1)$, with the remaining error fully explained by known sources. This work establishes a solid foundation for the continued development of quantum computing, simulation and entanglement-enhanced metrology with Yb neutral atom arrays.

# Directly measuring thrust from a superconducting applied field magnetoplasmadynamic thruster

## 直接测量来自超导应用场磁等离子体动力推进器的推力

Superconducting magnet technology can significantly improve the system-level performance of electromagnetic thrusters by reducing the size, weight and power of the magnet module. However, a superconducting magnet poses some unique challenges to accurate and direct thrust measurement, a key performance metric of any thruster. &nbsp;The Robinson Research Institute (Robinson) in New Zealand and the DLR Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology (DLR) in Gottingen, Germany, are working together on a project to directly measure thrust from a kW-class applied-field magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (AFMPDT) with a conduction-cooled superconducting magnet for its applied field module. This paper presents results of the characterization and modification of the thrust stands at DLR and Robinson to meet the additional challenges of stray magnetic fields, cryocooler vibrations and thermal gradients associated with the superconducting magnet system. We find that after some modifications to thrust stand parts and data analysis methods, the stray magnetic field and vibrations of a cryocooler, although large at approximately 1g peak acceleration, should have negligable impact on accuracy of thrust measurement. Moreover, the vibrations may improve the quality of the measurement by reducing hysteresis arising from bearing stiction. A variety of methods will need to be carefully employed to reduce sensitivity to temperature, particularly to an uneven temperature distribution across the pivot axis. As such, we deem it feasible to make direct thrust measurement in our facilities of a flight-like superconducting AFMPDT accurate to within a few mN. The key next stage of this project involves comparative measurements of a superconducting AFMPDT planned for 2025. &nbsp;

# Probing the Meissner effect in pressurized bilayer nickelate superconductors using diamond quantum sensors

## 使用金刚石量子传感器探测加压双层镍酸盐超导体中的迈斯纳效应

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5400764/latest

Recent reports on the signatures of high-temperature superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc close to 80 K have triggered great research interest and extensive follow-up studies1-8. Although zero-resistance state has been successfully achieved under improved hydrostatic pressure conditions3,9, there is no clear evidence of superconducting diamagnetism in pressurized La3Ni2O7-&delta; due to the low superconducting volume fraction and limited magnetic measurement techniques under high pressure conditions10. Here, using shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted on the culet of diamond anvils as in-situ quantum sensors, we observe convincing evidence for the Meissner effect in polycrystalline samples La3Ni2O7-&delta; and La2PrNi2O7: the magnetic field expulsion during both field cooling and field warming processes. The correlated measurements of Raman spectra and NV-based magnetic imaging indicate an incomplete structural transformation related to the displacement of oxygen ions emerging in the non-superconducting region. Furthermore, comparative experiments on different pressure transmitting media (silicone oil and KBr) and nickelates (La3Ni2O7-&delta; and La2PrNi2O7) reveal that an improved hydrostatic pressure conditions and the substitution of La by Pr in La3Ni2O7-&delta; can dramatically increase the superconductivity. Our work clarifies the controversy about the Meissner effect of bilayer nickelate and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of nickelate high-temperature superconductors.

# Optimizing Antimicrobial Stewardship in the Management of Vertebral Osteomyelitis: Analysis of Decade-long Data from a Central Taiwan Tertiary Teaching Hospital

## 在脊椎骨髓炎的管理中优化抗菌药物管理: 对台湾中部一家高等教学医院长达十年的数据进行分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5336948/latest

Background: Vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is associated with high morbidity rates[A1] . We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study to evaluate the effects of appropriate antibacterial therapies on the clinical outcomes of patients with VO. This study compared the outcomes of proper and empirical therapies to determine whether empirical antibiotic treatment versus targeted treatment based on microbial culture results leads to different long-term prognoses regarding complications and sequelae in [E2] patients with VO.
Methods: Patients diagnosed with VObetween January 2011 and February 2022 were selected from the Changhua Christian Hospital Clinical Research Database. The diagnosis of VO primarily relied on magnetic resonance imaging reports. We defined the microbiological relevance in patients with VO and identified the types of VO-related sequelae and complications in this cohort. This[A3] cohort was categorized into appropriate antibiotics(AA) and empirical therapy (ET).
Results: This cross-sectional cohort study collected data over ten years. In total, 230 patients with VO were included in our study. The mean age was 64.7 years, and 110 participants were men (30.8 %). [A4] Most of the participants had underlying diseases. Overall, 33.9 % of patients experienced complications[A5] , with a mortality rate of 4 %. The AA group had a significantly lower incidence of chronic low back pain than the ET group (6.9 % vs. 20.7 %, p=0.031).
Conclusions: Inappropriate antibiotic use in patients with VO has been associated with reduced symptomatic relief, highlighting the importance of antimicrobial stewardship. The symptoms improved with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Severe illness, rapid diagnosis, and early appropriate treatment are crucial for treating VO. This study emphasizes optimizing VO management within antimicrobial stewardship to enhance outcomes and reduce healthcare burden. Patients requiring surgery often experience spinal instability, severe nerve compression, or related complications. Severe lower back pain is joint, and appropriate antibiotics significantly alleviate this symptom compared with[E6] &amp;nbsp;empirical therapy. Identifying the causative pathogens of targeted therapy is essential for better long-term outcomes.

# Clinical Characterization of Aortitis and Periaortitis. Study of 134 Patients From a Single University Hospital

## 主动脉炎和主动脉炎的临床特征。来自单个大学医院的134例患者的研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5286739/latest

Background Aortitis and periaortitis represent the inflammation of the aortic wall and the surrounding periaortic tissues. Both may be severe, associated with different diseases and display unspecific manifestations. Early diagnosis is a challenge.Aim We assess the causes and main features of aortitis and periaortitis from a single university center.Methods Observational study of patients with aortitis or periaortitis from a referral center in Spain.Results We include 134 patients (87 female/47 male) (mean age: 55.1&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;9.1 years) with aortitis (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;132) or periaortitis (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;2). Aortitis was associated with: giant cell arteritis (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;102), Takayasu arteritis (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;6), IgG4-related disease (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;6), infectious diseases (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;3), malignancy (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1), drugs (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1), isolated aortitis (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1), and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;12). These IMIDs included: Sj&amp;ouml;gren syndrome (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;2), sarcoidosis (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;2), rheumatoid arthritis (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;2), axial spondyloarthritis (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;2), inflammatory bowel disease (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1), primary biliary cirrhosis (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1), idiopathic lung fibrosis (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1) and polyarteritis nodosa (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1). Periaortitis was due to idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis in both cases. The imaging techniques used for the diagnosis were: 18F-FDG PET/CT scan (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;133), computed tomography angiography (CT-A) scan (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;44) and/or magnetic resonance imaging angiography (MRI-A) (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;33). Ascending thoracic aorta was the most frequently involved segment. Polymyalgia rheumatica (52.2%) and asthenia (53.7%) were the most frequent clinical manifestations. Other manifestations were limb claudication (23.9%) and inflammatory back pain (26.9%). Acute phase reactants were usually high.Conclusion Aortitis is not an uncommon condition that may be related to multiple non-infectious entities. Clinical presentation is often non-specific, requiring a high index of suspicion, reason why the diagnosis is often delayed.

# Prevalence and predictive factors of concurrent cervical spinal cord compression in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures

## 骨质疏松性椎体压缩骨折患者并发颈髓压缩的患病率及预测因素分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5320325/latest

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the incidence, clinical features, and predictors of cervical spinal cord compression (CSCC) in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF).&amp;nbsp;
Methods: The study focused on patients with OVCF. The presence of CSCC was determined using the modified Cord Compression Index (Grades 0&ndash;3) based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire spine. Significant CSCC was defined as Grade&ge;2, and the distribution of compression level as well as the number of Grade&ge;2 segments were investigated in each patient. Predictive factors for CSCC were identified using multivariate regression analysis, with variables including sagittal parameters from MRI of the entire spine and general patient characteristics.&amp;nbsp;
Results: Out of 300 OVCF patients, 121 (40.3%) displayed significant CSCC on MRI. Of these, 106 were grade 2, and 15 were grade 3. Signal changes indicating myelomalacia were detected in 12 patients (4.0%) on T2-weighted MRI images. Of the 121 patients, 107 (88.4%) were asymptomatic or had subtle myelopathy, while 71 (58.7%) had multiple segmental compressions. The incidence of CSCC was positively correlated with age. Significant CSCC was most frequently found in the C4/5 and C5/6 segments. Only 4 patients (4.0%) underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) combined with cervical decompression and fusion surgery under general anesthesia in the one stage. Multivariate regression analysis identified age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and Torg-Pavlov ratio as independent predictors of CSCC grade.&amp;nbsp;
Conclusion: The prevalence of significant cervical spinal cord compression in OVCF patients was 40.3%, which is relatively high. In patients with older age, female sex, elevated BMI, or developmental spinal stenosis, preoperative cervical spine MRI and assessment for myelopathy signs and symptoms are essential to prevent adverse treatment outcomes. Prophylactic cervical decompression and general anesthesia should not be prioritized unless the patient has severe cervical spinal cord compression or local anesthesia is insufficient for PKP, as this approach is generally more beneficial for the patient.

# Vessel wall imaging of vertebrobasilar artery configurations: associations with posterior circulation infarction and high-risk plaques in atherosclerosis

## 椎基底动脉构型的血管壁成像: 与后循环梗死和动脉粥样硬化高危斑块的关联

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5324660/latest

The geometric configuration of the vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) can influence hemodynamic changes in the posterior circulation. This study aims to analyze the correlation of vascular morphology with posterior circulation infarction (PCI) and high-risk plaques on vessel wall imaging (VWI). A total of 249 atherosclerotic inpatients with 530 plaque segments located in the basilar artery (BA) and vertebral artery (VA) were retrospectively enrolled, comprising 98 PCI and 151 non-PCI patients. The configurations of VBA were classified on VWI and 3-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D TOF-MRA), with a further quantitative evaluation conducted on VWI. VWI achieved higher diagnostic accuracy in detecting tuning fork, walking, and lambda VBA configurations, and revealed increased sensitivity in diagnosing VA hypoplasia (VAH), compared to TOF-MRA. Higher proportions of PCI and high-risk plaques were observed in the lambda and walking configurations than the tuning fork. No statistical difference in VAH was observed between the PCI and non-PCI groups (P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;.972). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the mean diameter of bi-VAs [odds ratio (OR)&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1.709 (1.115&amp;ndash;2.618), P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;.014] and grade of BA lateral position [OR&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;1.461 (1.071&amp;ndash;1.993), P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;.017] were independent risk factors associated with PCI. High-risk plaque segments featured larger diameter, remodeling index, plaque volume, BA-midline, and vessel length compared with those with low-risk plaques (all P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;.05). VWI offers the dual advantages of observing vascular morphology and evaluating high-risk plaques, which aids in the timely identification of individuals with PCI risks.

# Large arterial ring formed by a duplicate origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) with a frontal branch arising from the superior channel of the ring (main MCA) diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography

## 由大脑中动脉 (MCA) 的重复起源形成的大动脉环，其额支由磁共振血管造影术诊断的环 (主MCA) 的上通道产生

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5321616/latest

Purpose To describe a case of large arterial ring formed by a duplicate origin of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) associated with a frontal branch arising from the superior channel of the ring (main MCA) using magnetic resonance (MR) angiography.Methods An 81-year-old man with spinocerebellar degeneration underwent cranial MR imaging and MR angiography using a 1.5-Tesla scanner. MR angiography was performed using a standard 3-dimensional time-of-flight technique.Results MR imaging showed cerebellar atrophy and multiple cerebral white matter lesions. Regarding family history, he was diagnosed with Machado-Joseph disease. On MR angiography, an anomalous artery arose from the lateral wall of the supraclinoid segment of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and fused with the main MCA, forming a large arterial ring. Thus, the anomalous artery was diagnosed as a duplicate origin of the MCA and not a duplicated MCA. The frontal branch of the MCA arose from the superior channel of the arterial ring (main MCA).Conclusion Using catheter angiography, a case of a large arterial ring formed by a duplicate origin of the MCA associated with the frontal branch arising from the superior channel of the ring (main MCA) was previously reported. This variation is called &amp;ldquo;segmental duplication of the MCA.&amp;rdquo; However, this term may be confused with a duplicate origin or fenestration of the proximal M1 segment of the MCA. We report the first case of this combined variation diagnosed using MR angiography.

# No effects of multi-modal intervention against cognitive decline on atrophy and small vessel disease imaging markers in the AgeWell.de imaging study

## 多模式干预对AgeWell.de成像研究中萎缩和小血管疾病成像标志物的认知下降没有影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5303457/latest

Background Multimodal lifestyle interventions might help to maintain healthy cognition in older age and to delay onset of dementia. Here, we studied the effects of a multi-modal lifestyle-based intervention, based on the FINGER trial, on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of hippocampal-limbic atrophy and cerebral small vessel disease in older adults at increased risk for dementia in Germany.Methods Leipzig participants of the multicenter AgeWell.de randomized controlled trial were examined with magnetic resonance imaging before and after a two year intervention at 3 Tesla MRI. We extracted hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness (ECT), free water fraction (FW), peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), white matter hyperintensity volume and mean gray matter cerebral blood flow and assessed the effect of the intervention on these imaging markers using linear mixed models. We also tested the effect of the intervention on the hippocampus-dependent Mnemonic Similarity Test and fixel-based white matter microstructure.Results 56 individuals (mean(sd) age: 68.8 (4.2) years, 26 females, 24/32 intervention/control group) were included at baseline and 41 returned after an average of 28 months for the second assessment. ECT and FW exhibited stronger decline in the intervention compared to the control group in preregistered models but not when adjusted for baseline differences. All other markers progressed similarly across groups. In exploratory analyses, cerebral blood flow increased more in the intervention group and this change was associated with decreases in systolic blood pressure.Conclusions In this group of older adults at risk for dementia, we did not find hypothesized beneficial effects of a multi-modal lifestyle intervention on brain imaging markers of neurodegeneration and small vessel disease. Yet, preliminary evidence suggested an association of the intervention, increased cerebral blood flow and systolic blood pressure reductions.Trial registration German Clinical Trials Register (reference number DRKS00013555)

# Facile and rapid preparation of magnetic imprinted adsorbent for specific separation and capture of liquid-crystal monomers pollutants in environmental water and soil samples

## 快速制备磁性印迹吸附剂，用于环境水和土壤样品中液晶单体污染物的特异性分离和捕获

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5117059/latest

Specific separation and extraction is a pivotal stage in the accurate quantification of liquid crystal monomers (LCMs) pollutants in complex environmental samples. In this context, a new fluorinated imprinted adsorbent (MIA) for magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) was one-pot prepared within 3.5 h using 4-[difluoro(3,4,5-trifluorophenoxy)methyl]-3,5-difluoro-4'-ethyl-biphenyl (DFBP) as template and 1H,1H,2H,2H-heptadecafluorodecyl acrylate/vinylanthracene as dual monomers. The structure, morphology and magnetic properties of MIA fabricated in the beneficial conditions were investigated by various characterized techniques. Under the optimal parameters, the prepared MIA presented satisfactory specific recognition performance. The recognition factor and adsorption capacity towards DFBP were as high as 2.7 and 15.9 mg/g, respectively. At the same time, the specific recognition behaviors of MIA/MSPE towards DFBP were surveyed by means of adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm. Combining with HPLC coupled with diode array detector (DAD), sensitive, reliable and anti-interference method for the monitoring of LCMs residuals in various environmental water and soil samples was established. The achieved enrichment factors were 132&amp;ndash;248 and 96&amp;ndash;204 in water and soil samples, respectively. The corresponding limits of detection were 0.0017&amp;ndash;0.0051 &amp;micro;g/L and 0.087&amp;ndash;0.28 &amp;micro;g/kg, respectively. Moreover, confirmatory experiments were adopted to inspect the accuracy of established MIA/MSPE-HPLC/DAD approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that using imprinted material to specific isolation and capture of LCMs which have been classified as emerging organic pollutants.

# Theoretical model and experimental verification of seepage-transition-spontaneous&nbsp;imbibition&nbsp;in&nbsp;water&nbsp;migration of water-injected&nbsp;coal

## 注水煤水迁移过程中渗流-转变-自发渗吸的理论模型及实验验证

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5053030/latest

Coal seam water injection is widely applied to prevent mine disasters. In the traditional water migration model of water-injected coal, from ignoring capillary force in the seepage stage to generating the capillary dynamic during the spontaneous imbibition state, no transition state exists from 0 to generating capillary force. In this paper, on the basis of theoretical analysis, an equivalent capillary term is introduced to modify the Forchheimer model, and then a seepage-transition-spontaneous imbibition model that is suitable for water migration of water-injected coal is proposed. The formulas for the upper critical point velocity v1, lower critical point velocity v2, and water migration range of the transition state are derived. An analysis experiment of the spontaneous imbibition state in the coal rock water injection process and a monitoring experiment of the water injection process based on nuclear magnetic resonance method are conducted to verify the accuracy of the model. Experimental results show that the water migration process of water-injected coal cannot be accurately reflected without considering the transition section. In this paper, the water migration model of water-injected coal is improved, which provides theoretical support for an in-depth understanding of the water injection mechanism of coal mine disaster prevention engineering.

# Direct observation of topological magnon edge states

## 拓扑magnon边态的直接观测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5433600/latest

Magnons, the quanta of spin waves, can serve as information carriers with promising applications in ultra-low-power spintronic devices.1,2 Magnon Chern insulators (MCIs) exhibiting unique topological magnon band structures featuring chiral edge states which can be utilized to construct novel spintronic devices.3,4 Though the existence of the MCIs are supported by the magnon related thermal Hall effect,5 direct observations of the topologically protected magnon edge states is still been pursued. Here, we report the spatially resolved detection of magnon edge states in a two-dimensional ferromagnet with honeycomb lattice (single-layer chromium triiodide). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed magnon-assisted inelastic tunneling conductance and revealed the gapped magnon spectra with enhanced signals at the van Hove singularities. Extra tunneling conductance contributed from the magnon edge states was detected at three different edge configurations. Our work provided direct evidence proving the existence of MCI states down to the single-layer limit, initiating spatially-resolved explorations on exotic properties arising from topological edge states of MCIs.
