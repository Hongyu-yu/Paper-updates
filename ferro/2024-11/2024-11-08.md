arXiv:2411.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials governed by emergent topological fermions have become a cornerstone of physics. Dirac fermions in graphene form the basis for moir\'e quantum matter, and Dirac fermions in magnetic topological insulators enabled the discovery of the quantum anomalous Hall effect. In contrast, there are few materials whose electromagnetic response is dominated by emergent Weyl fermions. Nearly all known Weyl materials are overwhelmingly metallic, and are largely governed by irrelevant, conventional electrons. Here we theoretically predict and experimentally observe a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet in van der Waals (Cr,Bi)$_2$Te$_3$. In transport, we find a record bulk anomalous Hall angle $> 0.5$ along with non-metallic conductivity, a regime sharply distinct from conventional ferromagnets. Together with symmetry analysis, our data suggest a semimetallic Fermi surface composed of two Weyl points, with a giant separation $> 75\%$ of the linear dimension of the bulk Brillouin zone, and no other electronic states. Using state-of-the-art crystal synthesis techniques, we widely tune the electronic structure, allowing us to annihilate the Weyl state and visualize a unique topological phase diagram exhibiting broad Chern insulating, Weyl semimetallic and magnetic semiconducting regions. Our observation of a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet offers an avenue toward novel correlated states and non-linear phenomena, as well as zero-magnetic-field Weyl spintronic and optical devices.

# Skyrmion Emergence via Domain Wall Anchoring through Vertical Bloch Line

## 通过垂直布洛赫线通过畴壁锚定的Skyrmion出现

arXiv:2411.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions, topologically stable magnetic solitons characterized by whirling magnetization in nanoscale magnetic elements, show promise information carriers in spintronics and spin-based quantum computing due to their unique properties: small size, stability, and controllability. In this study, we introduce a novel method of skyrmion generation through domain wall deformation dynamics. Our analytical and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that domain wall motion exceeding the Walker threshold induces topological deformation of magnetic domain walls exhibiting Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This deformation process catalyzes the emergence of skyrmions from magnetic domain wall structure distortion, specifically through the Anchoring of domain walls due to the vertical Bloch line. We elucidate the underlying mechanism of skyrmion generation, correlating it with topological transitions accompanied by burst energy dissipation through spin-wave radiation. Notably, we present robust skyrmion generation conditions through a comprehensive classification of domain wall distortion, including vertical Bloch line generation and annihilation in magnetic domain wall dynamics within a DMI system. These findings provide noble insights into topological behaviors of spin structures and offer a potential pathway for efficient, controlled skyrmion creation in the next-generation spintronic devices.

# New mechanism to enhance electron transverse transport by composite formation

## 复合形成增强电子横向输运的新机制

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04433

arXiv:2411.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.

Abstract: Motivated by a recent pseudo-spin model for monolayer-bilayer phase transitions in silver-based honeycomb layered materials, we propose that the critical pseudo-magnetic fields in such systems correspond to both the infinite-channel Feshbach resonance widths of a (Fermi-Dirac/Bose-Einstein/$\textit{etc}.$) condensate in $2$ dimensions, and equivalently to the Lee-Yang zeros of the Ising model of two pseudo-spins with a partition function corresponding to a class of functions that must include the Xi function, $\Xi(z/2) = \xi(s = 1/2 + iz/2)$. Identifying the quantum-mechanical operator that yields the \textit{discontinuous/random/topological} spectrum of the critical pseudo-magnetic fields in such systems offers a tenable realisation of the Hilbert-P\'{o}lya conjecture.

Abstract: Ferrimagnetic semiconductors, integrated with net magnetization, antiferromagnetic coupling and semi-conductivity, have constructed an ideal platform for spintronics. For practical applications, achieving high N$\acute{e}$el temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{N}}$) is very desirable, but remains a significant challenge. Here, via high-throughput density-functional-theory calculations, we identify 19 intrinsic ferrimagnetic semiconductor candidates from nearly 44,000 structures in the Materials Project database, including 10 ferrimagnetic bipolar magnetic semiconductors (BMS) and 9 ferrimagnetic half semiconductors (HSC). Notably, the BMS \ce{NaFe5O8} possesses a high $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ of 768 K. By element substitutions, we obtain an HSC \ce{NaFe5S8} with a $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ of 957 K and a BMS \ce{LiFe5O8} with a $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ reaching 1059 K. Our results pave a promising avenue toward the development of ferrimagnetic spintronics at ambient temperature.

# Colossal Dielectric Permittivity and Superparaelectricity in phenyl pyrimidine based liquid crystals

## 基于苯基嘧啶的液晶中的巨大介电常数和超顺电

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04606

arXiv:2411.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of polar rod-shaped liquid crystalline molecules with large dipole moments (mu > 10.4-14.8 D), their molecular structures based on the ferroelectric nematic prototype DIO, are designed, synthesized, and investigated. When the penultimate fluoro-phenyl ring is replaced by phenylpyrimidine moiety, the molecular dipole moment increases from 9.4 D for DIO to 10.4 D for the new molecule and when the terminal fluoro-group is additionally replaced by the nitrile group, the dipole moment rises to 14.8 D. Such a replacement enhances not only the net dipole moment of the molecule, but it also reduces the steric hindrance to rotations of the moieties within the molecule. The superparaelectric nematic (N) and smectic A (SmA) phases of these compounds are found to exhibit colossal dielectric permittivity, obtained both from dielectric spectroscopy, and capacitance measurements using a simple capacitor divider circuit. The electric polarization is measured vs. the field (E). However, no hysteresis in P vs. E is found in the nematic and smectic A phases. The colossal dielectric permittivity persists over the entire fluidic range. The experimental results lead us to conclude that these materials belong to the class of superparaelectrics (SPE) rather than to ferroelectrics due to the absence hysteresis and linear P vs E dependence. The synthesized organic materials are the first fluids for which superparaelectricity is discovered and furthermore these show great potential for the applications in supercapacitors used in storing energy.

# Dipolar effects on the behavior of magnetically diluted spin-ice

## 磁稀释自旋冰行为的偶极效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04738

arXiv:2411.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the magnetic behavior of diluted spin-ice systems, where magnetic moments are randomly removed at various concentrations. We concentrate on features in which the effect of long range dipolar interactions (usually masked by self-screening in these systems) is made visible by dilution. Our initial focus is on the configurations reached after cooling to low temperatures at zero-field, sweeping the whole density range of impurities. We observe that the missing magnetic moments induce a certain type of local, magnetic charge order. Next, using Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the behavior of the magnetization under an applied magnetic field in the [111] crystallographic direction. The inclusion of dipolar interactions allows to account for the main features observed in previous experimental results. Using the dumbbell model, where magnetic moments are represented as pairs of oppositely charged magnetic monopoles, we are able to understand the qualitative behavior of these curves as we increase doping. Additionally, we use this framework to calculate the critical fields corresponding to the phase transition observed in pure samples, and the characteristic fields appearing at very low doping.

# Field tunable BKT and quantum phase transitions in spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet

## 自旋1/2三角晶格反铁磁体中的场可调BKT和量子相变

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04755

arXiv:2411.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnetism is one of the most active fields for exploring exotic phases and phase transitions. The recently synthesized Na2BaCo(PO4)2 (NBCP) is an ideal material incarnation of the spin-1/2 easy axis triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF). Experimental evidence shows that NBCP hosts the spin supersolid state with a giant magnetocaloric effect. It was also proposed that the applied magnetic field B can drive the system through Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and other richer quantum phase transitions. However, the detection of these transitions is challenging because they onset at extremely low temperature T at around 60 mK, and the measurement of the magnetic susceptibility of these transitions requires high sensitivity. With the help of our newly developed gradient force magnetometer in a dilution refrigerator, we constructed the contour diagram of the magnetic susceptibility in the B-T phase diagram in T as cold as 30 mK. These results provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the several field-tunable quantum phase transitions and BKT melting of the spin supersolidity, which are especially significant when their giant magnetocaloric effects highlight potential applications for sub-Kelvin refrigeration under concerns about global helium shortages.

arXiv:2411.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties, as well as the adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) performance of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$. Although NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at a N\'eel temperature of $T_{\rm N} = 570$ mK in zero field, ADR experiments achieved a minimum temperature of 220 mK starting from $T = 2$ K under an applied magnetic field of $\mu_0H = 5$ T. The warm-up time back to $T = 2$ K exceeds 60 hours, which is roughly 50 times longer than that of its Yb-based analogue, underscoring the potential of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ as an efficient precooling stage in double-stage ADR systems. We show that NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ can be seen as a network of ferromagnetic spin chains with antiferromagnetic interchain couplings and also investigate the influence of antiferromagnetic ordering on the magnetic entropy. We find that the temperature dependence of the entropy plays a more dominant role than its magnetic field dependence in the magnetically ordered state.

# Generalized $XY$ model with competing antiferromagnetic and antinematic interactions

arXiv:2411.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study effects of $q$-order antinematic (AN$_q$) interactions on the critical behavior of the antiferromagnetic (AF) $XY$ model on a square lattice. It is found that the evolution of the phase diagram topology of such AF-AN$_q$ models with the parameter $q$ does not follow the same line as for the corresponding FM-N$_q$ models with the ferromagnetic (FM) and $q$-order nematic (N$_q$) interactions. Their phase diagrams are similar only for odd values of the parameter $q$. In such cases the respective phases reported in the FM-N$_q$ models are observed in the AF-AN$_q$ models on each of the two AF-coupled sublattices and the corresponding phase transitions are concluded to be of the same kind. On the other hand, for even values of $q$ the phase diagrams of the AF-AN$_q$ models are different from the FM-N$_q$ models and their topology does not change with $q$. Besides the pure AF and AN$_q$ phases, observed at higher temperatures in the regions of the dominant respective couplings, at low temperatures there is a new canted (C)AF phase, which results from the competition between the AF and AN$_q$ ordering tendencies and has no counterpart in the FM-N$_q$ model. The phase transitions to the CAF phase from both AF and AN$_q$ phases appear to be of the BKT nature.

arXiv:2411.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply density functional theory to explore the magnetoelectric (ME) properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{(Cl,Br,I)}_8$. These compounds have recently been proposed to exhibit coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order leading to a switchable anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). Using both spin-spiral and self-consistent spin-orbit coupled calculations, we predict an in-plane $120^\circ$ cycloid of trimerized spins as the ground state for $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$. For $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Br}_8$ and $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{I}_8$ we find long period incommensurate helical order. We calculate a number of magnetic properties such as the exchange constants, orbital magnetization, and Curie-Weiss transition temperatures, which are in good agreement with experimental values for the bulk compounds. It is then shown that, despite having both broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, the proposed AVHE and linear ME response are forbidden by the presence of helical order in the ground state. In addition, the computed switching trajectory demonstrates that it is unlikely that the polar state of the monolayers can be switched with a homogeneous electric field due to an unusual equation of state of the out-of-plane dipole moment. Nevertheless, we highlight that in the presence of a strong electric field, the trimerized spins in $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$ will exhibit a magnetic phase transition from the $120^\circ$ cycloid to out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, which restores the symmetry required for both AVHE and linear ME effects.

Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ provide a unique platform for studying the interplay between a variety of electronic orders, including superconductivity, charge density waves, nematic phases and more. Understanding the evolution of the electronic state from the charge density wave to the superconducting transition is essential for unraveling the interplay of charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom giving rise to the unusual magnetic properties of these nonmagnetic metals. Previous zero-field and high-field $\mu$SR studies revealed two anomalies in the muon spin relaxation rate, a first change at $T_{CDW} \sim 100$ K and a second steep increase at $T^{*}\sim 40$ K, further enhanced by an applied magnetic field, thus suggesting a contribution of magnetic origin. In this study, we use the avoided level crossing $\mu$SR technique to investigate charge order in near-zero applied field. By tracking the temperature dependence of quadrupolar level-crossing resonances, we examined the evolution of the electric field gradient at V nuclei in the kagome plane. Our results show a significant rearrangement of the charge density starting at $T^{*}$ indicating a transition in the charge distribution, likely electronic in origin, well below $T_{CDW}$. These findings, combined with previous $\mu$SR, STM, and NMR studies, emphasize the intertwined nature of proximate phases in these systems, with the charge rearrangement dominating the additional increase in $\mu$SR relaxation rate below $T^{*}$.

Abstract: Rare-earth diantimonides display intriguing ground states often associated with structural order, which can be manipulated in thin film geometries. In this study, we report epitaxial synthesis of one such compound, YbSb$_{2}$, on III-V substrates using molecular-beam epitaxy. The synthesized thin films exhibit large, non-saturating, linear magnetoresistance across a wide magnetic field range. Additionally, they demonstrate superconducting properties, with a critical temperature of $\approx$ 1.025 K and a critical field of $\approx$ 83.85 Oe, consistent with the reports in bulk single crystals. While YbSb$_{2}$ has been classified as a Type-I superconductor in its bulk form, our findings provide evidence of a mixed state in the epitaxial thin films. This work paves the way for controlling the electronic ground state in this class of materials through thin film engineering.

arXiv:2411.04294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral matter exhibits unique electromagnetic responses due to the macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly as anomalous transport currents. Here, we study the modification of electromagnetic radiation in isotropic chiral matter characterized by an axion coupling that varies linearly over time $\theta(t) = b_0 t$. Using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, we derive the causal Green's function to investigate the stability and radiation properties of the system. Even though the plane-wave modes of isotropic chiral matter exhibit imaginary frequencies for long wavelengths, which might suggest instability in the system, we show that their contribution is confined to the near-field region. Also we find no exponentially growing fields at arbitrarily large times, so that stability is preserved. Under these conditions the radiation yields a positive energy flux, although this is not an inherent property of the general definition. In the case of a fast-moving charge, we confirm the existence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation and show that, for refractive indices $n > 1$, the Cherenkov cone can split into two concentric cones with opposite circular polarizations. This split, governed by the speed of the particle $v$, $n$ and $b_0$, resembles the optical spin-Hall effect and offers potential applications for creating circularly polarized terahertz (THz) light sources. Our Green's function approach provides a general method for analyzing radiation in chiral matter, from Weyl semimetals to quark-gluon plasmas, and can be extended to systems such as oscillating dipoles and accelerated charges.

Abstract: We investigate the performance of state-of-the-art spintronic THz emitters (W or Ta)/CoFeB/Pt with non-magnetic underlayer deposited using oblique angle deposition. The THz emission amplitude in the presence or absence of an external magnetic field remains the same and remarkably stable over time. This stability is attributed to the enhanced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the ferromagnetic layer, achieved by oblique angle deposition of the underlying non-magnetic layer. Our findings could be used for the development of practical field-free emitters of linearly polarized THz radiation, potentially enabling novel applications in future THz technologies.

Abstract: Floquet systems are periodically driven systems. In this framework, the system Hamiltonian and associated spectra of interest are modified, giving rise to new quantum phases of matter and nonequilibrium dynamics without static counterparts. Here we experimentally demonstrate a self-induced Floquet system in the interacting Rydberg gas. This originates from the motion of photoionized charge particles in a static magnetic field. Importantly, by leveraging the Rydberg electomagnetically induced transparency spectrum, we probe the nonequilibrium dynamics in the bistable regime, where the strong Rydberg atom interaction competes with the internal driving from flying charges, and identify the emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase.

Abstract: The recently derived Fourier--Matsubara expansion of imaginary--time correlation functions comprises an exact result of linear response theory for finite-temperature quantum many-body systems. In its density--density version, the expansion facilitates systematic comparisons between quasi-exact \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo simulations and approximate dielectric formalism schemes at the level of the imaginary--time (density--density) correlation functions and the dynamic Matsubara local field corrections. On this theoretical basis, the dynamic properties of the quantum version of the Singwi--Tosi--Land--Sj\"olander scheme are analyzed for the paramagnetic warm dense uniform electron gas. The marginal improvement compared to the semi-classical version of the Singwi--Tosi--Land--Sj\"olander scheme is attributed to the weak Matsubara order dependence of the approximate dynamic Matsubara local field correction. The evaluation of the ideal density response function at the non-interacting occupation numbers is identified to constitute a general deficiency of the dielectric formalism, which calls for a reformulation in future works.

Abstract: We develop a theory of adiabatic orbital pumping, highlighting qualitative differences from spin pumping. An oscillating magnetic field pumps not only orbital angular momentum current but also orbital angular position current. The latter, which has no spin counterpart, underscores the incompleteness of existing orbital torque theories. Importantly, both types of orbital currents can be detected as transverse electric voltages, which contain considerable second harmonic components unlike in spin pumping. Moreover, orbital currents can be pumped by lattice dynamics that carry phonon angular momentum, implying that orbital currents can, in turn, induce phonon angular momentum. Our work open up new possibilities for generating orbital currents and provides a broader understanding of the interplay between spin, orbital, and phonon dynamics.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the impact of short-range antiferromagnetic correlations on the charge density wave (CDW) phase in strongly correlated electron systems exhibiting the pseudogap phenomenon. Our investigation employs a n-pole approximation to consider the repulsive Coulomb interaction $(U)$ and antiferromagnetic correlations. Utilizing a two-dimensional Hubbard model for the Coulomb interaction and a BCS-like model for the CDW order parameter, we observe that an increase in $U$ enhances antiferromagnetic fluctuations, resulting in a flattened re-normalized band around the anti-nodal point $(\pi,0)$. The pseudogap manifests in the band structure and density of states, prompting an exploration across various $U$ and occupation number values. Our findings indicate that antiferromagnetic correlations significantly influence the CDW state, as the Fermi surface is reconstructed within the ordered phase. Furthermore, we find a Lifhsitz transition inside both the CDW phase and the normal state, with the latter preceding the onset of the pseudogap.

Abstract: A nonlinearly enhanced electrical reactance, $\Im Z$, under a large AC current has been measured to explore emergent inductors, which constitute a new class of inductors based on the spin-transfer torque effect. A nonlinear $\Im Z$ has been observed in conducting magnets that contain noncollinear spin textures and interpreted as the realization of an inductance due to current-induced spin dynamics. However, curious behavior has concomitantly been observed. For instance, the nonlinear $\Im Z$ always has a cutoff frequency of $10^0$--$10^4$ Hz, which is much lower than the resonance frequency of a ferromagnetic domain wall, $\sim$10$^7$ Hz; furthermore, the temperature and magnetic field variations in $\Im Z$ appear to be considerably correlated with those in the temperature derivative of resistance. This behavior appears to be difficult to understand in terms of the current-induced spin dynamics, and therefore, the earlier interpretation of the nonlinear $\Im Z$ should be further verified. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that time-varying Joule heating and its impact on the AC electrical response can naturally explain these observations. In the experimental approach, we study the nonlinear AC electrical response of two conducting materials that exhibit no magnetic order, CuIr$_2$S$_4$ and 1$T$'-MoTe$_2$. Under time-varying Joule heating, a nonlinearly enhanced $\Im Z$ with the curious behavior mentioned above is observed in both systems. Our study implies that the nonlinear $\Im Z$ previously observed in noncollinear magnets includes a considerable contribution of the Joule-heating-induced apparent AC impedance.

Abstract: Compared to the intensive investigation on the 3d transition-metal (TM)-based spin ladder compounds, less attention has been paid to the ones constructed by the rare-earth (RE) ions. Herein, we report a family of RE-based spin ladder compounds Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE = Pr, Nd, Gd-Ho) crystallized into the monoclinic structure with the space group C2/c. The RE ions are arranged on a two-leg spin ladder motif along the b-axis, where the rung and leg exchange interactions are bridged via the RE-O-RE pathways and RE-O-Ge-O-RE routes, respectively. Moreover, the much shorter rung distance in the RE2O12 dimer units than the leg distance suggests Ba2RE2Ge4O13 to be a strong-rung spin ladder system. All the synthesized Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE = Pr, Nd, Gd-Ho) compounds exhibit the dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions and absence of magnetic order down to 1.8 K. Among the family members, Ba2Dy2Ge4O13 can be described by Jeff = 1/2 Kramers doublet states, the low temperature specific heat indicates the coexistence of spin dimerized state with broad maximum at ~ 2.4 K and long-range AFM order with TN = 0.81 K. This family of Ba2RE2Ge4O13 compounds thereby provides a rare platform to investigate the novel spin ladder physics constructed by 4f electrons.

Abstract: 'Strange' metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ($T$) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and Umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions such as large-$N$ limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a non-perturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals' key experimental signature of linear-in-$T$ resistivity with a 'planckian' transport scattering rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{tr} \sim k_B T/\hbar$ that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point, and instead arises from a phase of matter with gapless order parameter fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: a feature that is also observed in several experiments. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated electron materials.

Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.

arXiv:2411.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even if the magnetic field in a stellarator is integrable, phase-space integrability for energetic particle guiding center trajectories is not guaranteed. Both trapped and passing particle trajectories can experience convective losses, caused by wide phase-space island formation, and diffusive losses, caused by phase-space island overlap. By locating trajectories that are closed in the angle coordinate but not necessarily closed in the radial coordinate, we can quantify the magnitude of the perturbation that results in island formation. We characterize island width and island overlap in quasihelical (QH) and quasiaxisymmetric (QA) finite-beta equilibria for both trapped and passing energetic particles. For trapped particles in QH, low-shear toroidal precession frequency profiles near zero result in wide island formation. While QA transit frequencies do not cross through the zero resonance, we observe that island overlap is more likely since higher shear results in the crossing of more low-order resonances.

# The High-Order Magnetic Near-Axis Expansion: Ill-Posedness and Regularization

arXiv:2411.04352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When analyzing stellarator configurations, it is common to perform an asymptotic expansion about the magnetic axis. This so-called near-axis expansion is convenient for the same reason asymptotic expansions often are, namely, it reduces the dimension of the problem. This leads to convenient and quickly computed expressions of physical quantities, such as quasisymmetry and stability criteria, which can be used to gain further insight. However, it has been repeatedly found that the expansion diverges at high orders, limiting the physics the expansion can describe. In this paper, we show that the near-axis expansion diverges in vacuum due to ill-posedness and that it can be regularized to improve its convergence. Then, using realistic stellarator coil sets, we show that the near-axis expansion can converge to ninth order in the magnetic field, giving accurate high-order corrections to the computation of flux surfaces. We numerically find that the regularization improves the solutions of the near-axis expansion under perturbation, and we demonstrate that the radius of convergence of the vacuum near-axis expansion is correlated with the distance from the axis to the coils.

Abstract: The rapid growth in artificial intelligence and modern communication systems demands innovative solutions for increased computational power and advanced signaling capabilities. Integrated photonics, leveraging the analog nature of electromagnetic waves at the chip scale, offers a promising complement to approaches based on digital electronics. To fully unlock their potential as analog processors, establishing a common technological base between conventional digital electronic systems and analog photonics is imperative to building next-generation computing and communications hardware. However, the absence of an efficient interface has critically challenged comprehensive demonstrations of analog advantage thus far, with the scalability, speed, and energy consumption as primary bottlenecks. Here, we address this challenge and demonstrate a general electro-optic digital-to-analog link (EO-DiAL) enabled by foundry-based lithium niobate nanophotonics. Using purely digital inputs, we achieve on-demand generation of (i) optical and (ii) electronic waveforms at information rates up to 186 Gbit/s. The former addresses the digital-to-analog electro-optic conversion challenge in photonic computing, showcasing high-fidelity MNIST encoding while consuming 0.058 pJ/bit. The latter enables a pulse-shaping-free microwave arbitrary waveform generation method with ultrabroadband tunable delay and gain. Our results pave the way for efficient and compact digital-to-analog conversion paradigms enabled by integrated photonics and underscore the transformative impact analog photonic hardware may have on various applications, such as computing, optical interconnects, and high-speed ranging.

arXiv:2411.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal emission is a ubiquitous electromagnetic wave with an extreme broad spectrum in nature, and controlling thermal emission can be used to develop low-cost and convenient infrared light sources with wavelength tunable in a wide range that is currently difficult to other sources. Conventional metasurfaces are commonly used to control light but lack the flexibility to achieve complex emission spectral profiles and dynamic tuning. Here, we introduce a novel dual-layer metasurface structure with two completely independent layers to achieve a multi-peak thermal emission within the 5-8 {\mu}m wavelength range. Simulations and experiments show that this two-layer structure can achieve arbitrary spectral shapes without interfering with multiple resonant modes. This unique configuration presents a promising platform for further exploration in thermal emission engineering, enabling spectral control and dynamic tuning.

Abstract: We investigate the performance of state-of-the-art spintronic THz emitters (W or Ta)/CoFeB/Pt with non-magnetic underlayer deposited using oblique angle deposition. The THz emission amplitude in the presence or absence of an external magnetic field remains the same and remarkably stable over time. This stability is attributed to the enhanced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the ferromagnetic layer, achieved by oblique angle deposition of the underlying non-magnetic layer. Our findings could be used for the development of practical field-free emitters of linearly polarized THz radiation, potentially enabling novel applications in future THz technologies.

# Construction of an invertible mapping to boundary conforming coordinates for arbitrarily shaped toroidal domains

## 构造到任意形状的环形域的边界符合坐标的可逆映射

arXiv:2411.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary conforming coordinates are commonly used in plasma physics to describe the geometry of toroidal domains, for example, in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium solvers. The magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium configuration can be approximated with an inverse map, defining nested surfaces of constant magnetic flux. For equilibrium solvers that solve for this inverse map iteratively, the initial guess for the inverse map must be well defined and invertible. Even if magnetic islands are to be included in the representation, boundary conforming coordinates can still be useful, for example to parametrize the interface surfaces in multi-region, relaxed magnetohydrodynamics. Given a fixed boundary shape, finding a valid boundary conforming mapping can be challenging, especially for the non-convex boundaries from recent developments in stellarator optimization. In this work, we propose a new algorithm to construct such a mapping, by solving two Dirichlet-Laplace problems via a boundary integral method. We can prove that the generated harmonic map is always smooth and has a smooth inverse. Furthermore, we can find a discrete approximation of the mapping that preserves this property.

Abstract: We have theoretically investigated surface magnetoplasmons (SMPs) in a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sandwiched waveguide. The dispersion demonstated that this waveguide can support topological unidirectional SMPs. Based on unidirectional SMPs, magnetically controllable multimode interference (MMI) is verified in both symmetric and asymmetric waveguides. Due to the coupling between the modes along two YIG-air interfaces, the asymmetric waveguide supports a unidirectional even mode within a single-mode frequency range. Moreover, these modes are topological protected when disorder is introduced. Utilizing robust unidirectional SMPs MMI (USMMI), tunable splitters have been achieved. It has been demonstrated that mode conversion between different modes can be realized. These results provide many degrees of freedom to manipulate topological waves.

Abstract: Using optical technology for current injection and electromagnetic emission simplifies the comparison between materials. Here, we inject current into monolayer graphene and bulk gallium arsenide (GaAs) using two-color quantum interference and detect the emitted electric field by electro-optic sampling. We find the amplitude of emitted terahertz (THz) radiation scales in the same way for both materials even though they differ in dimension, band gap, atomic composition, symmetry and lattice structure. In addition, we observe the same mapping of the current direction to the light characteristics. With no electrodes for injection or detection, our approach will allow electron scattering timescales to be directly measured. We envisage that it will enable exploration of new materials suitable for generating terahertz magnetic fields.

Abstract: A complete, kinetic description of electron-seeded strong-field QED showers in crossed electromagnetic fields is derived. The kinetic structure of the shower and its temporal evolution are shown to be a function of two parameters: the initial shower quantum parameter and radiation time. The latter determines the short and long time evolution of the shower. Explicit solutions for the shower multiplicity (number of pairs per seed electron) and the emitted photon spectrum are obtained for both timescales. Our approach is first derived considering showers in a constant, homogeneous magnetic field. We find that our results are valid for any crossed fields and we apply them to laboratory settings for which we obtain fully analytical, predictive scaling laws.

Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.

Abstract: A wavepacket (electromagnetic or otherwise) within an isotropic and homogeneous space can be quantized on a regular lattice of discrete k-vectors. Each k-vector is associated with a temporal frequency omega; together, k and omega represent a propagating plane-wave. While the total energy and total linear momentum of the packet can be readily apportioned among its individual plane-wave constituents, the same cannot be said about the packet's total angular momentum. One can show, in the case of a reasonably smooth (i.e., continuous and differentiable) wave packet, that the overall angular momentum is expressible as an integral over the k-space continuum involving only the Fourier transform of the field and its k-space gradients. In this sense, the angular momentum is a property not of individual plane-waves, but of plane-wave pairs that are adjacent neighbors in the space inhabited by the k-vectors, and can be said to be localized in the k-space. Strange as it might seem, this hallmark property of angular momentum does not automatically emerge from an analysis of a discretized k-space. In fact, the discrete analysis shows the angular momentum to be distributed among k-vectors that pair not only with nearby k-vectors but also with those that are far away. The goal of the present paper is to resolve the discrepancy between the discrete calculations and those performed on the continuum, by establishing the conditions under which the highly non-local sum over plane-wave pairs in the discrete k-space would approach the localized distribution of the angular momentum across the continuum of the k-space.

# Velocity and acceleration fluctuations in dark matter and dynamical dark energy

arXiv:2203.05606v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Illustris and Virgo N-body simulations, we study the velocity and acceleration fluctuations in collisionless dark matter involving long-range gravity. By contrast, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo elastic collisions involving short-range interactions, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant. Long-range gravity requires a broad size of haloes to be formed. Hierarchical structure formation proceeds through the merging of smaller haloes to form larger haloes, which facilitates a continuous energy cascade from small to large haloes at a constant rate of $\varepsilon_u\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$. Velocity fluctuations involve a critical velocity $u_c\propto (1+z)^{-3/4}$, and acceleration fluctuations involve a critical acceleration $a_c\propto (1+z)^{3/4}$. The two quantities are related as $\varepsilon_{u}\approx -a_c u_c/(18\pi^2)$. With critical velocity $u_c$ on the order of 300km/s at $z=0$, the critical acceleration is found to be $a_{c0}\equiv a_c(z=0) \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ at $z=0$ that is higher at higher redshift. This suggests that the critical acceleration $a_c$ might explain the universal acceleration $a_0 \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ in the empirical Tully-Fisher relation and modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The predicted redshift evolution of $a_0 \propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ can be validated by Magneticum and EAGLE simulations. High-redshift Tully-Fisher relation will provide more insight. Finally, note that dark energy density $\rho_{DE}\approx {a_{c0}^{2}/G}=10^{-10}$J/m$^3$, we postulate an entropic origin of dark energy from the acceleration fluctuations in dark matter. A $\nu_0\nu_a$CDM model was proposed for the evolution of dynamical dark energy. When compared to the $w_0w_a$CDM model with constraints from DESI (2024), this model suggests a constant density at high redshift and a slower power-law weakening density at low redshift.

Abstract: Microscopic models based on multilevel atoms are central to optimizing non-linear optical responses and the coherent control of light. These models are traditionally based on single-atom effects that are parametrically extrapolated to include collective effects, such as an enhanced response or propagation within atomic media. In this work we present a systematic analysis of the cooperative effects arising in driven systems composed of multilevel atoms coupled via a common electromagnetic environment. The analysis is based on an interplay between dressed states induced by the driving field and photon exchanges, and collective decay channels. This theory is applied to the case of four-wave mixing induced by a pair of lasers acting on an atomic pair with internal levels in the diamond configuration. The effect of inter-atomic correlations and collective decay over the photons created in this nonlinear process is then explored.
  The dependence of single and two-photon correlations are studied in detail for each region by varying atomic orientations and laser parameters { consistent with current experiments involving atomic gases.}Photonic correlation functions are shown to exhibit a transition from a Lorentz-like dependence on the two-photon detuning -- with general features that can be obtained in an isolated atom scheme -- to a two-peaked distribution when the dipole-dipole interactions become relevant. For weak Rabi frequencies whose value is smaller than the highest collective decay rate, the atoms are trapped inside their ground state as they approach each other. It is found that the anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interaction and its wave nature are essential to understand the behavior of the photons correlations. Signatures of these processes are identified for existing experimental realizations.

Abstract: The regulation of electron heat transport in high-beta, weakly collisional, magnetized plasma is investigated. A temperature gradient oriented along a mean magnetic field can induce a kinetic heat-flux-driven whistler instability (HWI), which back-reacts on the transport by scattering electrons and impeding their flow. Previous analytical and numerical studies have shown that the heat flux for the saturated HWI scales as the inverse of electron beta. These numerical studies, however, had limited scale separation and consequently large fluctuation amplitudes, which calls into question their relevance at astrophysical scales. To this end, we perform a series of particle-in-cell simulations of the HWI across a range of electron beta and temperature-gradient length scales under two different physical setups. The saturated heat flux in all of our simulations follows the expected inverse-electron-beta scaling, supporting the robustness of the result. We also use our simulation results to develop and implement several methods to construct an effective collision operator for whistler turbulence. The results point to an issue with the standard quasi-linear explanation of HWI saturation, which is analogous to the well-known 90-degree scattering problem in the cosmic ray community. Despite this limitation, the methods developed here can serve as a blueprint for future work seeking to characterize the effective collisionality caused by kinetic instabilities.

The irregular movement of atoms or ions, known as self-diffusion, is a widespread phenom-enon in solids. In crystalline Li6.6P0.4Ge0.6S5I, the triplet arrangements within the Li-rich cag-es allow for ultrafast localized Li+ exchange processes. This feature leads us to consider whether, in addition to classical over-barrier hopping, quantum effects — commonly ob-served for electrons, protons, and deuterons — should also be taken into account for the heavier 7Li nuclei. To explore this hypothesis, we investigated 7Li spin fluctuations using nu-clear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) measurements at cryogenic temperatures, down to T = 9 K. Our findings reveal signatures in the SLR NMR data that we attribute to (coherent) quantum tunneling of the Li spins within the triplet arrangement. These insights not only enhance our understanding of atomic jump processes but also sug-gest potential future quantum applications involving 7(6)Li+ tunneling.

# Impact of Magnetic Ion Substitution on the Crystal Structure of Multiferroic Aurivillius Phases

## 磁性离子取代对多铁Aurivillius相晶体结构的影响

The five-layered (m = 5) Bi6Ti2.99Fe1.46Mn0.55O18 Aurivillius material is a rare example of a single-phase room temperature ferroelectric-ferrimagnetic multiferroic that shows promise for energy-efficient memory devices.  Its ferrimagnetism is thought to derive from the natural partitioning of magnetic ions to the central perovskite layer, engendered by chemically-driven lattice strains, together with ferromagnetic coupling via superexchange mechanisms. Motivated by the expectation of an enhancement in magnetization with increased magnetic ion content, this study examines systematic B-site substitutions with the aim of increasing (from the current level of 40%) the proportion of magnetic ions within the structure. The solubility limits of magnetic cations in this structure and their influence on the superlattice layering are investigated. Studies of Aurivillius phase films on c-sapphire with composition Bi6TixFeyMnzO18 (B6TFMO; x = 2.3 to 3.2, y = 1.2 to 2.0, z = 0.3 to 0.9) demonstrated that above ca. 46% of B-site magnetic cations, the m = 5 structure first rearranges into a mixed-phase material based on m = 5 and six-layered (m = 6) structures and eventually evolves into an m = 6 phase with 54% magnetic cations at the B-site. It is postulated that increasing the number of perovskite layers by forming the m = 6 structure facilitates the accommodation of additional magnetic cations at a lower average manganese oxidation state (+3.3) compared with an equivalent m = 5 stoichiometry (+4.0). While the minor out-of-plane ferroelectric response decreases as expected with increasing structural reorganization towards the m = 6 phase, the predominant in-plane piezoresponse remains unaffected by magnetic cation substitution. This work shows that higher-layered Aurivillius homologues can be synthesized using aliovalent substitution, without requiring epitaxial growth or kinetically constrained methods.

# Role of Cavity Strong Coupling on Single Electron Transfer Reaction at Electrode-Electrolyte Interface

## 空穴强耦合在电极-电解质界面单电子转移反应中的作用

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-51wmm-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Physicochemical properties of molecules can be modulated through the polariton formation under strong electromagnetic confinement. Here, we discuss the possibility of exploiting this phenomenon to increase the electron transfer rate at an electrode–electrolyte interface. Electron transfer theory under strong electromagnetic confinement can be extended to the electrode–electrolyte interface, and single–electron transfer reaction can be simulated using Gerischer’s theory. Although single electron transfer in free space is well described using Marcus theory, the vacuum electric field can facilitate an additional electron transfer pathway via virtual photon excitation under cavity strong coupling conditions. Therefore, this binary reaction pathway for single electron transfer can yield a quasi-two-particle electron transfer process. This quantum behavior can dominate when the mode volume is small and there is a large number of molecules in the vacuum electric field. Exploitation of polaritons in single electron transfer reactions can lead to enhanced electrochemical energy conversion systems.

# Precursor Reaction Pathway Leading to BiFeO3 Formation: Insights from Text-Mining and Chemical Reaction Network Analyses

## 导致BiFeO3形成的前体反应途径: 来自文本挖掘和化学反应网络分析的见解

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-xj01h?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

BiFeO3 (BFO) is a next-generation non-toxic multiferroic material with applications in sensors, memory devices, and spintronics, where its crystallinity and crystal structure directly influence its functional properties. Designing sol-gel syntheses that result in phase-pure BFO remains a challenge due to the complex interactions between metal complexes in the precursor solution. Here, we combine text-mined data and chemical reaction network (CRN) analysis to obtain novel insight into BFO sol-gel precursor chemistry. We perform text-mining analysis of 340 synthesis recipes with the emphasis on phase-pure BFO and identify trends in the use of precursor materials, including that nitrates are the preferred metal salts, 2-methoxyethanol (2ME) is the dominant solvent, and adding citric acid as a chelating agent frequently leads to phase-pure BFO. Our CRN analysis reveals that the thermodynamically favored reaction mechanism between bismuth nitrate and 2ME interaction involves partial solvation followed by dimerization, contradicting assumptions in previous literature. We suggest that further oligomerization, facilitated by nitrite ion bridging, is critical for achieving the pure BFO phase.

# Anisotropic activations controlling doublet-quartet spin conversion of linked chromophore-radical molecular qubits in fluid

## 各向异性激活控制流体中连接的发色团-自由基分子量子比特的双峰-四重自旋转换

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-jfv93?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Light-energy conversion processes causing alternations in spin multiplicity are attracting attention, but the development of quantum sensing technology applicable to fluid environment such as inside cells has been unexploited. How to achieve efficient energy conversion with controlling spin quantum coherence in a noisy condensed system is challenging. In this study, we investigate the effect of molecular motion on electron spin polarization to control quantum information of three-spin qubits in fluid environment by using steric effects of organic molecules at room temperature. Using time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) to observe the light-induced generation and transfer of quantum entanglement, we directly observed photoexcited quartet state generated in radical-chromophore coupled systems and clarified details of the electron spin polarization mechanism including decoherence effect by activation of anisotropic molecular motion by the steric effects.

# Comparative Statistics of Solar Flares and Flare Stars

## 太阳耀斑和耀斑恒星的比较统计

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5342946/latest

The distribution of interval times between recurrent discrete events, such as Solar and stellar flares, reflects their underlying dynamics. Log-normal functions provide good fits to the interval time distributions of many astronomical processes. The width of the fit is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes its underlying dynamics, in analogy to the critical exponents of renormalization group theory. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, as it often is, then the width of the log-normal is independent of the detector sensitivity, making it a robust metric. Analyzing two catalogues of Solar flares over periods ranging from 46 days to 37 years, we find that the widths of log-normal fits to the intervals between flares are wider than those of shot noise, indicating memory in the underlying dynamics even over a time much shorter than the Solar cycle. In contrast, the statistics of flare stars are consistent with shot noise (no memory). We suggest that this is a consequence of the production of Solar flares in localized transient active regions with varying mean flare rate, but that the very energetic flares of flare stars result from global magnetic rearrangement that reinitializes their magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.

# Development and Validation of Nomograms for Preoperative Differentiation of Benign and Malignant Breast Tumors Using Ultrasound and MRI

## 使用超声和MRI开发和验证用于术前鉴别良性和恶性乳腺肿瘤的列线图

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5302773/latest

Purpose: To develop nomograms based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) features for accurate preoperative classification of benign and malignant breast tumors.
Material and Methods: This retrospective study included 185 patients with breast tumors, divided into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression were employed to identify independent risk factors. Two models were developed based on these risk factors: Model 1 (US morphology + MRI border + lymph node metastasis) and Model 2 (US morphology + MRI border + lymph node metastasis + density). These models were evaluated using calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curves.
Results: Multivariate logistic analysis of the training set identified four independent risk factors: US morphology (OR: 0.075, P&amp;lt;0.05), density (OR: 1.581, P=0.608), MRI border (OR: 0.12, P&amp;lt;0.04), and lymph node metastasis (OR: 208.980, P=0.001). These factors were incorporated into the diagnostic nomogram for breast tumors. The nomograms demonstrated good predictive performance in distinguishing benign from malignant breast tumors. The area under the curve (AUC) for Model 1 was 0.960 (training set) and 0.922 (test set), while for Model 2, the AUC was 0.964 (training set) and 0.940 (test set).
Conclusion: This study highlights the effectiveness of MRI and US features in differentiating between benign and malignant breast tumors. Constructing nomogram models based on these features can enhance the accuracy of breast tumor diagnosis, facilitating personalized diagnosis and treatment for patients.

# Clinical evaluation of the arthroscopic decompression of spinoglenoid notch cyst through a single posterior portal

## 关节镜下经单孔后入路棘突窝囊肿减压术的临床评价

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5298764/latest

Introduction: To describe and evaluate the arthroscopic spinoglenoid notch cyst (SGNC) decompression technique through a single posterior working portal.Methods From January 2010 to March 2022, 20 patients of SGNC were included who were available for minimum of 2 years of follow-up. All surgical procedures were conducted with a suprascapular nerve decompression via posterior portal. For assessments, the visual analog scale (VAS), Constant-Murley shoulder score (CS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon (ASES) score, magnetic resonance image (MRI) and electromyogram (EMG) were used to compare preoperative and postoperative at follow-up. MRI and EMG were taken at 6 months postoperatively.Results All 20 patients were included in this study. Mean follow-up was 32.5&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;11.71 months. The VAS improved from 4.5&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;3.1 to 1.5&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.50 (P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;.001), the mean CS improved from 40.8&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;14.89 to 88.3&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;7.51 (P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;.001), and the mean ASES score improved from 50.5&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;10.62 to 87.8&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;6.95 (P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;.001) at last follow-up. The postoperative MRI and EGM performed at a mean of 6 months for all 20 cases revealed complete symptomatic remission. The satisfaction level with surgery was good to excellent in 19 patients.Conclusions For treatment of SGNC, arthroscopic decompression through single posterior portal was found to be a simple and effective method, maximizes visualization and reduces possible damage to the suprascapular nerve.

# The Brass Tacks of Gadolinium Toxicity: Precipitation of Gadolinium Oxalate from Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agents

## 钆毒性的黄铜钉: 磁共振成像造影剂中草酸钆的沉淀

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5054566/latest

The formation of gadolinium-rich nanoparticles in multiple tissues from intravenous magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents may be the initial step in rare earth metallosis. The mechanism of gadolinium-induced diseases is poorly understood, as is how these characteristic nanoparticles are formed. Gadolinium deposition has been observed with all magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent brands. Aside from endogenous metals and acidic conditions, little attention has been paid to the role of the biological milieu in the degradation of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents into nanoparticles. Herein, we describe the decomposition of the commercial magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents Omniscan and Dotarem in the presence of oxalic acid, a well-known endogenous compound. Omniscan dechelated rapidly and preluded measurement by the means available, while Dotarem underwent a two-step decomposition process. The decomposition of both magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents by oxalic acid formed gadolinium oxalate (Gd2[C2O4]3, Gd2Ox3). Furthermore, both observed steps of the Dotarem reaction involved the associative addition of oxalic acid. Adding protein (bovine serum albumin) increased the rate of dechelation. These reactions could occur at lysosomal pH. Through these studies, we have demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents can be dissociated by endogenous molecules, thus illustrating a metric by which gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) might be destabilized in vivo.

# The Role of Endoscopic Ultrasound in the Diagnosis and Characterization of Focal Liver Lesions

## 超声内镜在肝脏局灶性病变诊断和定性中的作用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5045406/latest

Background: Incidentally discovered focal liver lesions (FLLs) are a common reason for referral to hepatobiliary services. These lesions are frequently found in patients with colorectal cancer, cirrhosis, or incidentally during evaluations for abdominal pain or shock. Several established diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transabdominal ultrasound (US), and computed tomography (CT) are well-studied for assessing liver diseases. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), traditionally used for evaluating the mediastinum, biliary tract, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas, is increasingly complementing these traditional diagnostic methods in hepatology. The study aimed to delineate the endoscopic ultrasound elastography role in visualization and hepatic focal hepatic tissue differentiation of lesions in comparison to the routine radiological and laboratory methods.&amp;nbsp;
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, we enrolled 41 patients with hepatic focal lesions, abdominal ultrasonography, triphasic CT abdomen, and Endosonography examinations were performed on all participants.&amp;nbsp;
Results: There was a highly significant difference between the studied groups as regards the Strain Ratio and Echogenicity (P0.01).&amp;nbsp;
Conclusion: Ultrasound elastography and strain ratio are promising, non-invasive, nondependent on any contrast material techniques that could significantly enhance routine grey-scale sonographic examinations of the liver by better delineating the characteristics of hepatic focal lesions.

# Analyzing the Upper Mass Boundary of Main Sequence Stars

## 主序星质量上界分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5342146/latest

This study analyzes the upper mass boundary of stars on the main sequence, examining the various factors that influence their formation and evolution. The maximum mass of a star is not a fixed value; it fluctuates based on conditions such as stellar winds, metallicity, and the characteristics of the molecular cloud from which the star originates. For decades, the astrophysical community has debated the existence of a maximum mass limit, with estimates typically ranging from 120 to 300 solar masses, contingent upon environmental factors and initial conditions. The formation of massive stars initiates with the gravitational collapse of gas clumps in giant molecular clouds, leading to protostar formation. This phase is characterized by non-homologous collapse, significantly influenced by magnetic fields and accretion dynamics. As material accretes onto the protostar, radiation-driven winds sculpt the surrounding environment, culminating in supernova events. This research reviews several formation mechanisms, including monolithic collapse, competitive accretion, and stellar mergers, each dependent on the initial properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). By analyzing recent simulations and observational data, this work aims to enhance our understanding of the parameters governing massive star formation and their implications for the initial mass function (IMF). Ultimately, this study highlights the complexities of high-mass stars and their vital role in the evolution of the universe.

# Computational modelling of the semi-classical quantum vacuum in 3D

## 三维半经典量子真空的计算模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5305075/latest

The commissioning of multi-Petawatt laser systems is gathering pace around the world, promising unparalleled access to ultra-high electromagnetic fields for fundamental Physics studies. Here, we present the first three-dimensional simulation results of two quantum vacuum effects using a semi-classical numerical solver for the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian. The simulation model is benchmarked against vacuum birefringence analytical results using counter-propagating probe and pump pulses. Simulations of both plane-wave and Gaussian pulses show results consistent with theoretical predictions. The solver is then applied to four-wave mixing using three realistic Gaussian pulses for the first time. First results of the polarisation and power of the output pulse and the number of photons obtained from the interaction are obtained and compared with theory. The output power and polarisation dependence on input polarisation is also investigated, and found to be consistent with the theoretical predictions.

# A universal pathway for solar flare eruptions

## 太阳耀斑爆发的通用途径

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5314233/latest

Solar flares are driven by a rapid release of magnetic energy accumulated quasi-statically in the solar corona. This energy accumulation, driven by magnetohydrodynamics processes, occurs in macroscale systems, while its release is governed by kinetic effects at microscale. The vast separation in system scales hinders the understanding of cross-scale energy cascades, leaving the question of how flare eruptions are initiated unresolved. Here, we report laboratory experiments that replicate the complete evolution of coronal magnetic energy from quasi-static accumulation to abrupt release and subsequent eruption. The experiments adopt the most common bipolar field in solar active regions, and drive magnetic energy accumulation with the most prevalent quasi-static stress. We show that the accumulated energy is stored in a magnetohydrodynamics-governed current sheet located at the polarity inversion line of the bipolar field. The current density and thickness of the current sheet continuously vary with energy storage, ultimately falls into kinetic regimes. We found that the current sheet, governed by kinetic effects, rapidly undergoes unstable fragmentation. Concurrently, plasmoid-mediated magnetic reconnection is triggered, initiating magnetic eruptions. Our results demonstrate a universal pathway for flare eruptions and how the current sheet and plasmoid-mediated reconnection function in this process, placing critical constraints on solar eruptions.
