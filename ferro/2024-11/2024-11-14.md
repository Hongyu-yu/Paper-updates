# Spin-liquid-based topological qubits

## 基于自旋液体的拓扑量子比特

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08093

arXiv:2411.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation relies on control of non-Abelian anyons for inherently fault-tolerant storage and processing of quantum information. By now, blueprints for topological qubits are well developed for electrically active topological superconductor and fractional quantum Hall platforms. We leverage recent insights into the creation and detection of non-Abelian anyons in electrically insulating spin systems to propose topological qubit architectures based on quantum spin liquids. We present two types of prototype designs that enable the requisite control in a potentially scalable framework: one invokes spin liquids integrated into magnetic tunnel junction arrays, the other uses semiconductor-spin liquid hybrids. We further identify various protocols for interrogating spin-liquid-based topological qubits, both to validate the underlying principles of topological quantum computation and to establish gates required for universal quantum computation. These results provide long-term direction for experimental investigation of Kitaev materials and potentially other solid-state spin liquid hosts.

# Magnetic-field suppression of tomographic electron transport

## 层析电子传输的磁场抑制

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08102

arXiv:2411.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the "tomographic" transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wavenumbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.

# Anyon polarons as a window into the competing phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a Zeeman field

## 任何极化子作为进入Zeeman场下Kitaev蜂窝模型竞争阶段的窗口

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08105

arXiv:2411.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the spectra of anyon quasiparticles in all three super-selection sectors of the Kitaev model (i.e., visons, fermions and bosons), perturbed by a Zeeman field away from its exactly solvable limit, to gain insights on the competition of its non-abelian spin-liquid with other nearby phases, such as the mysterious intermediate state observed in the antiferromagnetic model. Both for the ferro- and antiferro-magnetic models we find that the fermions and visons become gapless at nearly identical critical Zeeman couplings. In the ferromagnetic model this is consistent with a direct transition into a polarized state. In the anti-ferromagnetic model this implies that previous theories of the intermediate phase viewed as a spin liquid with a different fermion Chern number are inadequate, as they presume that the vison gap does not close. In the antiferromagnetic model we also find that a bosonic quasiparticle becomes gapless at nearly the same critical field as the fermions and visons. This boson carries the quantum numbers of an anti-ferromagnetic order parameter, suggesting that the intermediate phase has spontaneously broken symmetry with this order.

# Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08121

arXiv:2411.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.

# Evidence for Atomic-Scale Inhomogeneity in Superconducting Cuprate NMR

## 超导铜酸盐NMR中原子尺度不均匀性的证据

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08142

arXiv:2411.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1990, the Millis, Monien, and Pines (MMP) model and its improvement, the Zha, Barzykin, and Pines (ZBP) model in 1996, emerged as a realistic explanation of the cuprate NMR. These two models assume a single electronic component, translational symmetry, and that the electrons simultaneously have aspects of localized antiferromagnetic (AF) spins and delocalized Cu $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band states. NMR experiments were routinely fit to these models in the 1990s and early 2000s until they finally failed as NMR experiments developed further. It appears that cuprate theorists have given up on explaining the NMR and the NMR data is forgotten. Here, we assume a two-component model of electrons where the electrons reside in two regions, one metallic with delocalized band states, and the other antiferromagnetic with localized spins. This model breaks translational symmetry. We show that the normal state spin relaxation for the planar Cu, O, and Y atoms in $\mathrm{YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}}$ and their Knight shifts are explained by this two-component model. The temperature dependence of the Cu spin relaxation rate anisotropy in the superconducting state is also explained qualitatively.

# Ultrafast electron dynamics in altermagnetic materials

## 磁材料中的超快电子动力学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08160

arXiv:2411.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a new class of magnetic materials that combine properties previously thought to be exclusive to either antiferromagnets or ferromagnets, and have unique properties of their own. In particular, a combination of symmetries connecting magnetic sublattices gives rise to a band spin splitting exhibiting unconventional d, g, or i-wave character. Their unique electronic properties have already led to new spin-dependent transport effects. Here, we consider their spin and charge dynamics on ultrafast timescales. We use a minimal tight binding model that captures the main features of the altermagnetic candidate material KRu$_4$O$_8$. In the framework of this model, we compute the spin-dependent electronic scattering dynamics after ultrashort-pulse excitation and show through these microscopic calculations how electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering processes redistribute optically excited carriers in a 2D slice of the Brillouin zone. We find that the optically excited spin polarization is long lived (~1ps) compared to the electron-electron momentum scattering lifetime of roughly 10fs. This contrasts remarkably with the much shorter spin lifetimes observed in typical ultrafast electronic spin dynamics in conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, making these pulse-driven spin excitation experiments a key probe of altermagnetism.

# Tuning the Quasi-bound States of Double-barrier Structures: Insights from Resonant Tunneling Spectra

## 调整双势垒结构的准束缚态: 来自共振隧穿光谱的见解

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08287

arXiv:2411.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the resonant tunneling (RT) of electrons and H atoms in double-barrier (DB) systems. Our numerical calculations directly verify the correspondence between the resonant tunneling energies and the energy levels of quasi-bound states (QBS) within the double barriers. Based on this, in-depth analyses are carried out on the modulation of QBS energy levels and numbers which show step variation with the inter-barrier spacing. The mathematical criterion for the existence of QBS is derived, and the impacts of the barrier width and barrier height on QBS levels are investigated. Taking the rectangular double-barrier as an example, we have studied the manipulation of electronic structures and optical properties of the inter-barrier region (quasi-potential well) by tuning the inter-barrier spacing (width of quasi-potential well). Atom-like optical absorption features are found in the range of infrared to visible spectrum, which can be continuously tuned by the variation of quasi-potential well width. The potential application of double-barrier nanostructures in ultrahigh-precision detection of electromagnetic radiations is demonstrated.

# Magnetic field control over the axialness of Higgs modes in charge-density wave compounds

## 电荷密度波化合物中Higgs模式的轴性的磁场控制

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08331

arXiv:2411.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how symmetry-breaking processes generate order out of disorder is among the most fundamental problems of nature. The scalar Higgs mode - a massive (quasi-) particle - is a key ingredient in these processes and emerges with the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Its related exotic and elusive axial counterpart, a Boson with vector character, can be stabilized through the simultaneous breaking of multiple continuous symmetries. Here, we employ a magnetic field to tune the recently discovered axial Higgs-type charge-density wave amplitude modes in rare-earth tritellurides. We demonstrate a proportionality between the axial Higgs component and the applied field, and a 90$^{\circ}$ phase shift upon changing the direction of the B-field. This indicates that the axial character is directly related to magnetic degrees of freedom. Our approach opens up an in-situ control over the axialness of emergent Higgs modes.

# Evidence of Orbital Hall current revealed in second harmonic response of longitudinal and transverse voltage in light metal-ferromagnet bilayers

## 在轻金属-铁磁体双层中纵向和横向电压的二次谐波响应中揭示了轨道霍尔电流的证据

arXiv:2411.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of orbital Hall torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR), arising from the orbital Hall effect generated by the transverse flow of orbital angular momentum in light metals under an applied electric current. Through second-harmonic measurements, we investigate orbital Hall torque and UMR in bilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic materials (FM), such as Ni and NiFe, paired with light metals (LM), such as Ti and Nb. Our results demonstrate that LM/Ni bilayers exhibit enhanced damping-like torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) compared to LM/NiFe bilayers. This enhancement suggests that angular momentum is generated via the orbital Hall effect within the light metal, where it undergoes orbital-to-spin conversion within the Ni ferromagnet, ultimately transferring to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. Torque and UMR are also absent in single-layer devices, highlighting the necessity of the bilayer structure for orbital current generation.

arXiv:2411.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superlattice formation dictates the physical properties of many materials, including the nature of the ground state in magnetic materials. Chemical composition is commonly considered to be the primary determinant of superlattice identity, especially in intercalation compounds. Here, we find that, contrary to this conventional wisdom, kinetic control of superlattice growth leads to the coexistence of disparate domains within a compositionally "perfect" single crystal. We demonstrate that Cr$_{1/4}$TaS$_2$ is a bulk noncollinear antiferromagnet in which scattering between bulk and minority superlattice domains engenders complex magnetotransport below the N\'{e}el temperature, including an anomalous Hall effect. We characterize the magnetic phases in different domains, image their nanoscale morphology, and propose a mechanism for nucleation and growth. These results provide a blueprint for the deliberate engineering of macroscopic transport responses via microscopic patterning of magnetic exchange interactions in superlattice domains.

# Hidden quantum correlations in the ground states of quasiclassical spin systems

## 准典型自旋系统基态中的隐藏量子相关性

arXiv:2411.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated spin models may lead to the formation of both classical non-collinear spin structures and unique quantum phases including highly entangled quantum spin liquids. Here, we study the entanglement and spatial quantum correlations in linear spin-wave theory around a classical spin-spiral ground state. We find that the entanglement between pairs of sites is short-ranged, and is completely absent in certain cases. In contrast, the entanglement hidden in multi-site clusters is peaked close to phase transitions and shows an asymptotic behavior modulated by the period of the magnetic structure. These findings motivate further exploring the connection in the entanglement properties of fully quantum and of quasiclassical spin models.

arXiv:2411.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of quantum ordering in strongly correlated systems remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, with implications for designing novel quantum materials. Here, we investigate kinetic antiferromagnetism on a triangular lattice under an applied magnetic field, where spin-polarons emerge as charge-magnon bound states with mutual attraction. Using large-scale diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this interaction drives high-temperature phase separation into charge- and magnon-rich regions, bordered by polarised Mott insulating voids. Spectral function analysis reveals a substantial energy correction from magnon interactions, indicating that these carrier-rich regions form a strongly bound charge-magnon liquid. These findings shed new light on recent experiments on MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers, underscoring kinetic magnetism as a unique pathway for strong inter-carrier attraction and high-temperature quantum ordering, with potential applications in quantum materials.

We find that the MW first increases and then remains almost constant with the increasing thickness of the top Al2O3. The phenomenon is attributed to the lower electric field of the ferroelectric Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ in the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al2O3 after a program operation. The lower electric field makes the charges trapped at the top Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O$_2$ interface, which are injected from the metal gate, cannot be retained. Furthermore, we study the effect of the top Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer thickness on the reliability (endurance characteristics and retention characteristics). We find that the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer has poorer retention and endurance characteristics. Our work is helpful in deeply understanding the effect of top interlayer thickness on the MW and reliability of Si-FeFETs with MIFIS gate stacks.

# Bulk Crystal Growth and Single-Crystal-to-Single-Crystal Phase Transitions in the Averievite CsClCu5V2O10

Abstract: Quasi-two-dimensional averievites with triangle-kagome-triangle trilayers are of interest due to their rich structural and magnetic transitions and strong spin frustration that are expected to host quantum spin liquid ground state with suitable substitution or doping. Herein, we report growth of bulk single crystals of averievite CsClCu5V2O10 with dimensions of several millimeters on edge in order to (1) address the open question whether the room temperature crystal structure is P-3m1, P-3, P21/c or else, (2) to elucidate the nature of phase transitions, and (3) to study direction-dependent physical properties. Single-crystal-to-single-crystal structural transitions at ~305 K and ~127 K were observed in the averievite CsClCu5V2O10 single crystals. The nature of the transition at ~305 K, which was reported as P-3m1-P21/c transition, was found to be a structural transition from high temperature P-3m1 to low temperature P-3 by combining variable temperature synchrotron X-ray single crystal and high-resolution powder diffraction. In-plane and out-of-plane magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements confirm a first-order transition at 305 K, a structural transition at 127 K and an antiferromagnetic transition at 24 K. These averievites are thus ideal model systems for a deeper understanding of structural transitions and magnetism.

# Electron-Magnon Coupling Mediated Magnetotransport in Antiferromagnetic van der Waals Heterostructure

arXiv:2411.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-magnon coupling reveals key insights into the interfacial properties between non-magnetic metals and magnetic insulators, influencing charge transport and spin dynamics. Here, we present temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy and magneto-transport measurements of few-layer graphene (FLG)/antiferromagnetic FePS\(_3\) heterostructures. The magnon mode in FePS\(_3\) softens below 40 K, and effective magnon stiffness decreases with cooling. Magnetotransport measurements show that FLG exhibits negative magnetoresistance (MR) in the heterostructure at low fields (\(\pm 0.2 \, \text{T}\)), persisting up to 100 K; beyond this, MR transitions to positive. Notably, as layer thickness decreases, the coupling strength at the interface reduces, leading to a suppression of negative MR. Additionally, magnetodielectric measurements in the FLG/FePS\(_3\)/FLG heterostructure show an upturn at temperatures significantly below ($T_\text{N}$), suggesting a role for the magnon mode in capacitance, as indicated by hybridization between magnon and phonon bands in pristine FePS\(_3\) \textit{via} magnetoelastic coupling.

# Maximum limit of connectivity in rectangular superconducting films with an oblique weak link

arXiv:2411.08649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for measuring the electrical connectivity between parts of a rectangular superconductor was developed for weak links making an arbitrary angle with the long side of the sample. The method is based on magneto-optical observation of characteristic lines where the critical current makes discontinuous deviations in the flow direction to adapt to the non-uniform condition created by the presence of the weak link. Assuming the Bean critical state model in the full penetration regime for a sample submitted to a perpendicular magnetic field, the complete flow pattern of screening currents is reconstructed, from which the transparency of the weak link, i.e., the ratio between its critical current and that of the pristine sample, $\tau = \frac{J_i}{J_c}$, is then related to the angle $\theta$ formed by two characteristic discontinuity lines which, in turn, are intimately associated to the presence of the weak link. The streamline distribution is compared with magneto-optical observations of the flux penetration in Nb superconducting films, where a weak link was created using focused ion beam milling. The present work generalizes previous analyses in which the weak link was perpendicular to the long sides of the rectangular sample. Equations and measurements demonstrate that the relationship between the transparency and the angle $\theta$ is not affected by the tilting of the weak link. Noticeably, in order to attain optimum connectivity, the weak link critical current can be less than that of the pristine sample, namely, $\tau _{max}=\sin \Phi$, where $\Phi$ is the tilt angle of the weak link. This expression generalizes the previous result of $\tau _{max}=1$ for $\Phi=$ 90$^\circ$.

arXiv:2411.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-\ce{MoS2} exhibits spin- and valley-dependent massive tilted Dirac cones with two velocity correction terms in low-energy effective Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate the longitudinal diffusive magnetoconductivity of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-\ce{MoS2} by using the linear response theory. It is shown that, when the Fermi level is close to the spin-orbit coupling gap, the Weiss oscillation splits into two branches and exhibits spin-valley polarization in the presence of both a spatial periodic electric potential modulation in the lateral direction and a nonzero perpendicular electric field. The spin-valley polarization stems from the interplay between the tilted Dirac cones, the spin-orbit coupling gap, and the external electric potential modulation, and can be treated as a signature of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-\ce{MoS2}. When the Fermi level is far from the spin-orbit coupling gap, the spin-polarization appears in the Weiss oscillation under a magnetic field modulation in the lateral direction. This polarization behavior arises from the interplay between the tilted Dirac cones, the spin-orbit coupling, and the external magnetic field modulation, indicating that a finite spin-orbit coupling gap is not indispensable for polarization in the Weiss oscillation.

arXiv:2411.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broken symmetry plays a pivotal role in determining the macroscopic electrical, optical, magnetic, and topological properties of materials. Circular dichroism (CD) has been widely employed to probe broken symmetry in various systems, from small molecules to bulk crystals, but designing CD responses on demand remains a challenge, especially for antiferromagnetic materials. Here, we develop a cavity-enhanced CD technique to sensitively probe the magnetic order and broken symmetry in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. By introducing interfacial inversion asymmetry in cavity-coupled FePS3 crystals, we demonstrate that the induced CD is strongly coupled with the zig-zag antiferromagnetic order of FePS3 and can be tuned both spectrally and in magnitude by varying the cavity length and FePS3 thickness. Our findings open new avenues for using cavity-modulated CD as a sensitive diagnostic probe to detect weak broken symmetries, particularly at hidden interfaces, and in systems exhibiting hidden spin polarization or strong correlations.

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) of nickelates has potential similarities with cuprate superconductors, which may provide unique perspectives on the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most of high-pressure experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase. Therefore, the discovery of new superconducting nickelate compounds is highly desired to explore the generality of pressure-induced superconductivity in RP nickelates. Here, we grow high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure and conduct high-pressure transport measurements with various pressure transmitting mediums. The density wave in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal was suppressed by pressure, accompanying the arising of superconducting state beyond 10 GPa. The maximum and unsaturated Tc of 39 K is obtained within our research pressure. Although zero resistivity was not achieved in our experiments, the pressure and temperature-dependent diamagnetism along with the systematic evolution of resistivity with applied magnetic field, corroborate the superconductivity in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals. Our findings provide a new platform for the investigation of the relationship among structural evolution, magnetism, correlation, and superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.

Abstract: Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ thin films, significant research has focused on Zr-doped HfO$_2$ and solid solution (Hf,Zr)O$_2$ thin films. Functional properties can be further tuned via multilayering, however, this approach has not yet been fully explored in HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ films. This work demonstrates ferroelectricity in a 50 nm thick, solution-processed HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayer film, marking it as the thickest such film to date exhibiting ferroelectric properties. The multilayer structure was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, with high-resolution TEM revealing grain continuity across multiple layers. This finding indicates that a polar phase in the originally paraelectric ZrO$_2$ layer, can be stabilized by the HfO$_2$ layer. The film attains a remanent polarization of 8 uC/cm$^2$ and exhibits accelerated wake-up behavior, attributed to its higher breakdown strength resulting from the incorporation of multiple interfaces. These results offer a faster wake-up mechanism for thick ferroelectric hafnia films.

Abstract: We show that the ground state of a weakly charged two-dimensional electron-hole fluid in a strong magnetic field is a broken translational symmetry state with interpenetrating lattices of localized vortices and antivortices in the electron-hole-pair field. The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density and weakening magnetic fields drive vortex delocalization transitions signaled experimentally by abrupt increases in counterflow transport resistance.

arXiv:2411.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the initial discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials, significant effort has been made to incorporate the three properties of magnetism, band structure topology, and strong electron correlations $-$ to leverage emergent quantum phenomena and expand their potential applications. However, the discovery of a single vdW material that intrinsically hosts all three ingredients has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we report the discovery of a Kondo-interacting topological antiferromagnet in the vdW 5$f$ electron system UOTe. It has a high antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature of 150 K, with a unique AFM configuration that breaks the combined parity and time reversal ($PT$) symmetry in an even number of layers while maintaining zero net magnetic moment. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal Dirac bands near the Fermi level, which combined with our theoretical calculations demonstrate UOTe as an AFM Dirac semimetal. Within the AFM order, we observed the presence of the Kondo interaction, as evidenced by the emergence of a 5$f$ flat band near the Fermi level below 100 K and hybridization between the Kondo band and the Dirac band. Our density functional theory calculations in its bilayer form predict UOTe as a rare example of a fully-compensated AFM Chern insulator.

Abstract: Response theories in condensed matter typically describe the response of an electron fluid to external electromagnetic fields, while perturbations on neutral particles are often designed to mimic such fields. Here, we study the response of fermions to a space-time-dependent velocity field, thereby sidestepping the issue of gauge charge. First, we use a semiclassical chiral kinematic theory to obtain the local density of current and extract the orbital magnetization. The theory immediately predicts a "converse vortical effect," defined as an orbital magnetization driven by linear velocity. It receives contributions from magnetic moments on the Fermi surface and the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Then, transcending semiclassics via a complementary Kubo formalism reveals that the uniform limit of a clean system receives only the Berry curvature contribution while other limits sense the Fermi surface magnetic moments too. We propose CoSi as a candidate material and suggest magnetometry of a sample under a thermal gradient to detect the effect. Overall, our study sheds light on the effects of a space-time-dependent velocity field on electron fluids and paves the way for exploring quantum materials using new probes and perturbations.

Abstract: Two legged skewed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ladders are frustrated and exhibit exotic quantum phases in ground state due to strong quantum fluctuations and competing spin exchanges. Here, we study ground state properties of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model on 3/4, 3/5 and 5/5 skewed ladders in the presence of a Zeeman magnetic field, $B$, using exact diagonalization and the density matrix renormalization group method. We note the existence of plateaus at $m =$ 1/3 and 2/3 for 3/4 skewed ladder, at $m =$ 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 for 3/5 skewed ladder, and at $m =$ 0, 1/3, and 2/3 for 5/5 skewed ladder, where $m$ is the ratio of the observed magnetization ($M$) to the saturated magnetization (${M_\mathrm{max}}$). The plateau state is always a gapped state and the plateau width depends on the gap in the system. Surprisingly, the 3/4 and 5/5 skewed ladders show interesting quadrupolar or n-type spin nematic phases below the 1/3$^{rd}$ plateau, i.e, at very low magnetic fields. These two systems are unique as they host both a plateau and a quadrupolar phase at low magnetic fields. The linear variation of pitch angle of the spin with magnetization and behavior of binding energy of magnon pairs as function of magnetic field are also calculated in both the systems. We also study the contribution of the binding energy to two magnon condensate.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in a paramagnetic effective spin-1/2 magnetic insulator CsYbSe$_2$, by introducing a minimal model requiring only Zeeman splitting and magnetoelastic coupling. We use it to argue that hybridized excitations -- formed from acoustic phonons and localized spin-flip-excitations across the Zeeman gap of the crystal electric field ground doublet -- are responsible for a non-monotonic field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivity. Beyond highlighting a starring role for phonons, our results raise the prospect of universal magneto-thermal transport phenomena in paramagnetic insulators that originate from simple features shared across many systems.

Abstract: We carry out a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic structure of the ambient-pressure bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing the hybrid exchange-correlation functional, we show that the exchange-correlation pushes the bonding $d_{z^2}$ bands below the Fermi level to be fully occupied. The calculated Fermi surfaces and the correlation normalized band structure match well with the experimental findings at ambient pressure. Moreover, the electronic susceptibility calculated for this new band structure features nesting-induced peaks near the wave vector $Q=(\pi/2, \pi/2)$, suggesting a possible density wave instability in agreement with recent experiments. Through a mean field study and DFT+U calculation introducing a Hubbard U interaction within conventional density functional theory, we confirm the spin-charge intertwined double stripe order is the magnetic ground state. Our results provide a faithful description for the low-pressure La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure.

Abstract: We found signatures of current-induced sliding motion in helimagnetic $\mathrm{Mn}\mathrm{Au}_2$ thin films. An abrupt change in differential resistivity occurred at a threshold bias current in the helimagnetic state, whereas it was absent in the induced ferromagnetic state. Broadband voltage noise also emerged above the threshold current in the helimagnetic state. Based on the similarity to canonical charge/spin density wave systems, we ascribed the origin of these phenomena to the sliding motion of the helimagnetic structure.

Abstract: We study the Kondo lattice model of multipolar magnetic moments interacting with conduction electrons on a triangular lattice. Bond-dependent electron hoppings induce a compass-like anisotropy in the effective Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between multipolar moments. This unique anisotropy stabilizes multipolar skyrmion crystals at zero magnetic field. In a unit cell, the skyrmion fractionalizes into meron composites subject to the conservation of total topological charge. Diverse multipolar phases in the phase diagram give rise to novel spontaneous Hall response of conduction electrons.

Abstract: The Griffiths phase in systems with quenched disorder occurs below the ordering transition of the pure system down to the ordering transition of the actual disordered system. While it does not exhibit long-range order, large fluctuations in the disorder degrees of freedom result in exponentially rare, long-range ordered states and hence the occurrence of broad distributions in response functions. Inside the Griffiths phase of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility is expected to have such a broad, exponential tail. A large-deviations Monte Carlo algorithm is used to sample this distribution and the exponential tail is extracted over a wide range of the support down to very small probabilities of the order of $10^{-300}$. We study the behavior of the susceptibility distribution across the full phase diagram, from the paramagnetic state through the Griffiths phase to the ferromagnetically ordered system and down to the zero-temperature point. We extract the rate function of large-deviation theory as well as its finite-size scaling behavior and we reveal interesting differences and similarities between the cases. A connection between the fraction of ferromagnetic bonds in a given disorder sample and the size of the magnetic susceptibility is demonstrated numerically.

Abstract: We present a computational study to explore the potential of different experimental approaches to tune the magnetic interactions in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets. We selected CrGeSe$_3$, CrGeTe$_3$, and Janus Cr$_2$Ge$_2$(Se,Te)$_3$ monolayers as case studies and calculated the full exchange tensors among all relevant atomic pairs and analyze their dependence on different external parameters, such as biaxial and uniaxial strain, as well as gate voltage. We pay special attention to interactions that emerge or vanish due to changes of the symmetry of the system. We find that biaxial and uniaxial strains significantly modify isotropic exchange couplings, which can lead to a transition from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic phase, while a gate voltage induces Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, forming a vortex pattern whose chirality is determined by the sign of the electric field. The electric dipole moment of the Janus material is large, raising the possibility of multiferroic behaviour. The polarizability is similar for the three compounds.

arXiv:2408.17447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the signatures of the topological properties of the bandstructures for nodal-point semimetals are embedded in the response coefficients, arising in two distinct experimental set-ups, by taking the Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal as an example. The first scenario involves the computation of third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the charge/thermal current densities to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field/temperature gradient. On the premises that internode scatterings can be ignored, the relaxation-time approximation leads to a quantized value for the nonvanishing components of each of these nonlinear response tensors, characterizing a single untilted RSW node. Furthermore, the final expressions turn out to be insensitive to the specific values of the chemical potential and the temperature. The second scenario involves computing the magnetoelectric conductivity under the action of collinear electric ($\mathbf E$) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields, representing a planar Hall set-up. In particular, our focus is in bringing out the dependence of the linear-in-$|\mathbf B|$ parts of the conductivity tensor on the intrinsic topological properties of the bandstructure, which are nonvanishing only in the presence of a nonzero tilt in the energy spectrum.

Abstract: We apply density functional theory to explore the magnetoelectric (ME) properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{(Cl,Br,I)}_8$. These compounds have recently been proposed to exhibit coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order leading to a switchable anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). Using both spin-spiral and self-consistent spin-orbit coupled calculations, we predict an in-plane $120^\circ$ cycloid of trimerized spins as the ground state for $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$. For $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Br}_8$ and $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{I}_8$ we find long period incommensurate helical order. We calculate a number of magnetic properties such as the exchange constants, orbital magnetization, and Weiss temperatures. It is then shown that, despite having both broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, the proposed AVHE and linear ME response are forbidden by the presence of helical order in the ground state. In addition, the computed switching trajectory demonstrates that it is unlikely that the polar state of the monolayers can be switched with a homogeneous electric field due to an unusual equation of state of the out-of-plane dipole moment. Nevertheless, we highlight that in the presence of a strong electric field, the trimerized spins in $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$ will exhibit a magnetic phase transition from the $120^\circ$ cycloid to out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, which restores the symmetry required for both AVHE and linear ME effects.

Abstract: Quantum dot-based spin qubit realization is one of the most promising quantum computing systems owing to its integrability with classical computation hardware and its versatility in realizing qubits and quantum gates. In this work, we investigate a quantum dot-based universal set of quantum gates (single qubit gates and the Toffoli gate) in the presence of hyperfine fluctuation noise and phononic charge noise. We model the spin dynamics and noise processes in the NOT gate, Hadamard gate and the Toffoli gate using the Lindblad master equation formalism to estimate the operating ranges of the external static and ac magnetic fields to achieve high fidelity operation of these gates in a noisy environment. In addition, the generality of the framework proposed in this paper enables modeling of larger quantum processors based on spin qubits in realistic conditions.

Abstract: Computing the partition function, $Z$, of an Ising model over a graph of $N$ \enquote{spins} is most likely exponential in $N$. Efficient variational methods, such as Belief Propagation (BP) and Tree Re-Weighted (TRW) algorithms, compute $Z$ approximately by minimizing the respective (BP- or TRW-) free energy. We generalize the variational scheme by building a $\lambda$-fractional interpolation, $Z^{(\lambda)}$, where $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$ correspond to TRW- and BP-approximations, respectively. This fractional scheme -- coined Fractional Belief Propagation (FBP) -- guarantees that in the attractive (ferromagnetic) case $Z^{(TRW)} \geq Z^{(\lambda)} \geq Z^{(BP)}$, and there exists a unique (\enquote{exact}) $\lambda_*$ such that $Z=Z^{(\lambda_*)}$. Generalizing the re-parametrization approach of \citep{wainwright_tree-based_2002} and the loop series approach of \citep{chertkov_loop_2006}, we show how to express $Z$ as a product, $\forall \lambda:\ Z=Z^{(\lambda)}{\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$, where the multiplicative correction, ${\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$, is an expectation over a node-independent probability distribution built from node-wise fractional marginals. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive experiments with models from Ising ensembles over planar and random graphs of medium and large sizes. Our empirical study yields a number of interesting observations, such as the ability to estimate ${\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$ with $O(N^{2::4})$ fractional samples and suppression of variation in $\lambda_*$ estimates with an increase in $N$ for instances from a particular random Ising ensemble, where $[2::4]$ indicates a range from $2$ to $4$. We also discuss the applicability of this approach to the problem of image de-noising.

# Out-of-equilibrium Chiral Magnetic Effect from simulations on Euclidean lattices

arXiv:2404.14263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The status of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) response in full Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has been controversial so far, with previous lattice QCD studies indicating either its strong suppression or vanishing in thermal equilibrium state. We introduce the Euclidean-time correlator of axial charge and electric current as an observable that can be used to study the finite out-of-equilibrium CME response in first-principle lattice QCD simulations with background magnetic field. This observable directly reflects the fact that in the background magnetic field, a state with nonzero axial charge features nonzero electric current. For free fermions, the axial-vector correlator only receives contributions from the Lowest Landau Level, and exhibits a linear dependence on both magnetic field and temperature with a universal coefficient. With an appropriate regularization, non-vanishing axial-vector correlator is compatible with the vanishing of the CME current in thermal equilibrium state with nonzero chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. We demonstrate that the real-time counterpart of the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator is intimately related to the real-time form of the axial anomaly equation, which strongly limits possible corrections in full QCD. We present numerical results for the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator in $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory with $N_f = 2$ light quark flavours, demonstrating reasonable agreement with free fermion result on both sides of the chiral crossover. The proposed methodology should help to answer the question whether the QCD corrections might be responsible for non-observation of CME in heavy-ion collision experiments such as the RHIC isobar run.

Abstract: Geomagnetically Induced Current (GIC) refers to the electromagnetic response of the Earth and its conductive modern infrastructures to space weather and would pose a significant threat to high-voltage power grids designed for the alternative current operation. To assess the impact of space weather on the power grid, one needs to calculate the GIC on a national or continental scale. In this study, we developed a smart and parallelized GIC modelling algorithm, Graph GIC. This algorithm deploys a graph representing a power grid in a single-line diagram, in which substations/transformers act as nodes and transmission lines as edges. With these denotations, a power grid and its electric parameters are mathematically represented with an adjacency matrix and an admittance matrix. We used sparse matrix and parallelisation techniques to expedite the intensive computation in cases of large-scale power grids. The Graph GIC was validated with a benchmark grid, applied to the GIC calculation of the 500 kV power grid of Guangdong, China, and conducted preliminary analysis on the grid's susceptibility to geomagnetic storms. The Graph GIC algorithm has the advantage of an intuitive and highly scalable graph representation of a power grid at any scale. It achieves high-accuracy calculation and a speedup of about 18 times after parallelisation. This algorithm could be applied to assess the impact of space weather on a power grid up to continental scales and could be incorporated into global space weather modelling frameworks.

# Tailoring Transverse Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Enhancement in Mie-resonant Nanowire-based Metasurfaces

## 在基于Mie谐振纳米线的超表面中定制横向磁光克尔效应增强

arXiv:2411.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancement and tailoring of the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) in hybrid metasurfaces comprising rectangular silicon nanowires coupled with a nickel substrate are demonstrated. The excitation of Mie modes of different orders in nanowires causes the enhancement. The in-plane magnetic dipole mode leads to the largest TMOKE enhancement compared to other Mie modes. Changing the width of silicon nanowires leads to a modification of that mode, thereby ensuring the tailoring of the TMOKE within the range of $2.2\% - 3.8\%$. This tunability is associated with the modification of the near-field localized at the Si/Ni interface and the far-field response of the excited magnetic dipole mode. Adjusting these two quantities allows one to achieve the highest values of the TMOKE caused by individual Mie modes in silicon nanowires.

# HTS Undulator Design Study and First Results

## HTS波荡器设计研究和初步结果

arXiv:2411.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undulators are X-ray sources that are widely utilised in advanced synchrotron radiation sources and freeelectron laser facilities. Due to sustainability and energy efficiency, the development focuses on small-scale, high-field, and especially compact undulators with short period lengths ($\leq$ 10 mm) and narrow magnetic gaps ($\leq$ 4 mm). Therefore, hightemperature superconducting (HTS) tapes, which can provide a high critical current density and high critical magnetic fields at higher temperatures, are extensively used and investigated at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. A new concept of superconducting undulators (SCUs) was introduced and further developed by laser-scribing a meander pattern into the superconducting layer to achieve a quasi-sinusoidal current path through the HTS tape. Here we present the complete and final design of such a compact SCU, in particular our latest results regarding the design of the liner with its tapering in the warm region, as well as the cryogenic cooling concept.

# Intelligent Adaptive Metasurface in Complex Wireless Environments

## 复杂无线环境中的智能自适应元表面

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08538

arXiv:2411.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The programmable metasurface is regarded as one of the most promising transformative technologies for next-generation wireless system applications. Due to the lack of effective perception ability of the external electromagnetic environment, there are numerous challenges in the intelligent regulation of wireless channels, and it still relies on external sensors to reshape electromagnetic environment as desired. To address that problem, we propose an adaptive metasurface (AMS) which integrates the capabilities of acquiring wireless environment information and manipulating reflected electromagnetic (EM) waves in a programmable manner. The proposed design endows the metasurfaces with excellent capabilities to sense the complex electromagnetic field distributions around them and then dynamically manipulate the waves and signals in real time under the guidance of the sensed information, eliminating the need for prior knowledge or external inputs about the wireless environment. For verification, a prototype of the proposed AMS is constructed, and its dual capabilities of sensing and manipulation are experimentally validated. Additionally, different integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios with and without the aid of the AMS are established. The effectiveness of the AMS in enhancing communication quality is well demonstrated in complex electromagnetic environments, highlighting its beneficial application potential in future wireless systems.

# Simulating the Arrival of Multiple Coronal Mass Ejections that Triggered the Gannon Superstorm on May 10, 2024

arXiv:2411.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The May 10, 2024 space weather event stands out as the most powerful storm recorded during the current solar cycle. This study employs a numerical framework utilizing a semi-empirical coronal model, along with HUXt (Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation with time-dependence) and cone-CME models for the inner heliosphere, to forecast solar wind velocity and the arrival of CMEs associated with this event. The simulations were also carried out using Space Weather Adaptive SimulaTion (SWASTi) and a drag-based model (DBM) for this complex event of multiple CMEs. Predicted arrival times and velocities from these models are compared with actual observations at the Sun-Earth L1 point. These simulations reveal that three coronal mass ejections (CMEs) reached Earth nearly simultaneously, resulting in the extreme space weather event, followed by the arrival of a few more eruptions. The simulations accurately predicted arrival times with a discrepancy of approximately 5 hours or less for these CMEs. Further, the ensemble study of DBM shows the sensitivity of the CME arrival time to the background solar wind speed and drag parameters. All three models have done fairly well in reproducing the arrival time closely to the actual observation of the CMEs responsible for the extreme geomagnetic storm of May 10, 2024. These rare solar storms offered a unique opportunity to thoroughly evaluate and validate our advanced models for predicting their arrival on the Earth.

# Quantitative imaging of the fresh/saltwater interface with airborne electromagnetics: examining different sources of uncertainty

## 用机载电磁对淡水/盐水界面进行定量成像: 检查不确定性的不同来源

arXiv:2411.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing the distribution between fresh and saline groundwater is imperative for sustainable and integrated management of water resources in coastal areas. The airborne electromagnetic (AEM) method is increasingly used for hydrogeological mapping over large areas via bulk electrical resistivity. However, accurately and reliably mapping the fresh/saltwater interface (FSI) requires accurate knowledge about the transition zone. The objective is to quantify the uncertainty in using AEM data to inform on the depth of the FSI. The study mimics a dual-moment time-domain SkyTEM sounding recorded in the Belgian coastal plain based on borehole data. It quantifies uncertainty using a differential evolution adaptive Metropolis algorithm to sample the posterior distribution. The results indicate the importance of reliable altitude, pitch and roll logging. Gathering prior knowledge about the transition zone, for example, through borehole logs, significantly improves the estimation of the FSI. The Resolve frequency-domain system, especially in context with very shallow to shallow FSIs, is more suitable for salinity mapping than the time-domain SkyTEM used in the field survey. The depth of the FSI may be defined via various threshold values. The uncertainty of three different thresholds is studied. The FSI based on the middle of the transition zone is the most reliable, while the FSI based on the 1500 mg/L total dissolved solids threshold is the least robust.

# Trapped-ion laser cooling in structured light fields

## 结构光场中的囚禁离子激光冷却

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08844

arXiv:2411.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.

# Spherically symmetric Earth models yield no net electron spin

## 球对称地球模型不产生净电子自旋

arXiv:2411.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial experiments that use electrons in Earth as a spin-polarized source have been demonstrated to provide strong bounds on exotic long-range spin-spin and spin-velocity interactions. These bounds constrain the coupling strength of many proposed ultralight bosonic dark-matter candidates. Recently, it was pointed out that a monopole-dipole coupling between the Sun and the spin-polarized electrons of Earth would result in a modification of the precession of the perihelion of Earth. Using an estimate for the net spin-polarization of Earth and experimental bounds on Earth's perihelion precession, interesting constraints were placed on the magnitude of this monopole-dipole coupling. Here we investigate the spin associated with Earth's electrons. We find that there are about $6 \times 10^{41}$ spin-polarized electrons in the mantle and crust of Earth oriented anti-parallel to their local magnetic field. However, when integrated over any spherically-symmetric Earth model, we find that the vector sum of these spins is zero. In order to establish a lower bound on the magnitude of the net spin along Earth's rotation axis we have investigated three of the largest breakdowns of Earth's spherical symmetry: the large low shear-velocity provinces of the mantle, the crustal composition, and the oblate spheroid of Earth. From these investigations we conclude that there are at least $5 \times 10^{38}$ spin-polarized electrons aligned anti-parallel to Earth's rotation axis. This analysis suggests that the bounds on the monopole-dipole coupling that were extracted from Earth's perihelion precession need to be relaxed by a factor of about 2000.

Abstract: Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.

# Viscous Heating and Instabilities in the Partially Ionized Solar Atmosphere

## 部分电离的太阳大气中的粘性加热和不稳定性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08242

arXiv:2411.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In weak magnetic fields ($\lesssim 50 \,\mbox{G}$), parallel and perpendicular viscosities, mainly from neutrals, may exceed magnetic diffusivities (Ohm, Hall, ambipolar) in the middle and upper chromosphere. Ion-driven gyroviscosity may dominate in the upper chromosphere and transition region. In strong fields ($\gtrsim 100\, \mbox{G}$), viscosities primarily exceed diffusivities in the upper chromosphere and transition region. Parallel and perpendicular viscosities, being similar in magnitude, dampen waves and potentially compete with ambipolar diffusion in plasma heating, potentially inhibiting Hall and ambipolar instabilities when equal. The perpendicular viscosity tensor has two components, $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$, which differ slightly and show weak dependence on ion magnetization. Their differences, combined with shear, may destabilize waves, though magnetic diffusion introduces a cutoff for this instability. In configurations with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ having vertical ($b_z=B_z/|\bf{B}|$) and azimuthal ($b_y=B_y/|\bf{B}|$) components, and a wavevector $\bf{k}$ with radial ($\kx=k_x/|\bf{k}|$) and vertical ($\kz=k_z/|\bf{k}|$) components, parallel viscosity and Hall diffusion can generate the viscous-Hall instability. Gyroviscosity further destabilizes waves in the upper regions. These findings indicate that the solar atmosphere may experience various viscous instabilities, revealing complex interactions between viscosity, magnetic fields, and plasma dynamics across different atmospheric regions.

# Zones of Tayler Instability in Stars

## 恒星中的泰勒不稳定性区域

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08492

arXiv:2411.08492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tayler instability (TI) of toroidal magnetic fields is a candidate mechanism for driving turbulence, angular momentum transport, and dynamo action in stellar radiative zones. Recently Skoutnev & Beloborodov (2024) revisited the linear stability analysis of a toroidal magnetic field in a rotating and stably stratified fluid. In this paper, we extend the analysis to include both thermal and compositional stratification, allowing for general application to stars. We formulate an analytical instability criterion for use as a ``toggle switch" in stellar evolution codes. It determines when and where in a star the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may be responsible for angular momentum transport. We implement such a ``toggle switch" in the MESA stellar evolution code and map out the stability of each mode of the TI on a grid of stellar evolution models. In evolved lower mass stars, the TI becomes suppressed in compositionally stratified regions, undermining the Tayler-Spruit dynamo as an explanation of the core-envelope coupling. In higher mass stars, the TI is active throughout the radiative zones, but at different wavenumbers than previously expected.

# Effect of Top Al$_2$O$_3$ Interlayer Thickness on Memory Window and Reliability of FeFETs With TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$/SiO$_x$/Si (MIFIS) Gate Structure

Abstract: We investigate the effect of top Al2O3 interlayer thickness on the memory window (MW) of Si channel ferroelectric field-effect transistors (Si-FeFETs) with TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$/SiO$_x$/Si (MIFIS) gate structure. We find that the MW first increases and then remains almost constant with the increasing thickness of the top Al2O3. The phenomenon is attributed to the lower electric field of the ferroelectric Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ in the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al2O3 after a program operation. The lower electric field makes the charges trapped at the top Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O$_2$ interface, which are injected from the metal gate, cannot be retained. Furthermore, we study the effect of the top Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer thickness on the reliability (endurance characteristics and retention characteristics). We find that the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer has poorer retention and endurance characteristics. Our work is helpful in deeply understanding the effect of top interlayer thickness on the MW and reliability of Si-FeFETs with MIFIS gate stacks.

# Nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production using polarized photons from inverse Compton scattering

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08559

arXiv:2411.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observing multiphoton electron-positron pair production (the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process) requires high-energy $\gamma$ rays to interact with strong electromagnetic fields. In order for these observations to be as precise as possible, the $\gamma$ rays would ideally be both mono-energetic and highly polarized. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of an experimental configuration that accomplishes this in two stages. First, a multi-GeV electron beam interacts with a moderately intense laser pulse to produce a bright, highly polarized beam of $\gamma$ rays by inverse Compton scattering. Second, after removing the primary electrons, these $\gamma$ rays collide with another, more intense, laser pulse in order to produce pairs. We show that it is possible to measure the $\gamma$-ray polarization dependence of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in near-term experiments, using a 100-TW class laser and currently available electron beams. Furthermore, it would also be possible to observe harmonic structure and the perturbative-to-nonperturbative transition if such a laser were colocated with a future linear collider.

arXiv:2411.08667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broken symmetry plays a pivotal role in determining the macroscopic electrical, optical, magnetic, and topological properties of materials. Circular dichroism (CD) has been widely employed to probe broken symmetry in various systems, from small molecules to bulk crystals, but designing CD responses on demand remains a challenge, especially for antiferromagnetic materials. Here, we develop a cavity-enhanced CD technique to sensitively probe the magnetic order and broken symmetry in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. By introducing interfacial inversion asymmetry in cavity-coupled FePS3 crystals, we demonstrate that the induced CD is strongly coupled with the zig-zag antiferromagnetic order of FePS3 and can be tuned both spectrally and in magnitude by varying the cavity length and FePS3 thickness. Our findings open new avenues for using cavity-modulated CD as a sensitive diagnostic probe to detect weak broken symmetries, particularly at hidden interfaces, and in systems exhibiting hidden spin polarization or strong correlations.

Abstract: Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ thin films, significant research has focused on Zr-doped HfO$_2$ and solid solution (Hf,Zr)O$_2$ thin films. Functional properties can be further tuned via multilayering, however, this approach has not yet been fully explored in HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ films. This work demonstrates ferroelectricity in a 50 nm thick, solution-processed HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayer film, marking it as the thickest such film to date exhibiting ferroelectric properties. The multilayer structure was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, with high-resolution TEM revealing grain continuity across multiple layers. This finding indicates that a polar phase in the originally paraelectric ZrO$_2$ layer, can be stabilized by the HfO$_2$ layer. The film attains a remanent polarization of 8 uC/cm$^2$ and exhibits accelerated wake-up behavior, attributed to its higher breakdown strength resulting from the incorporation of multiple interfaces. These results offer a faster wake-up mechanism for thick ferroelectric hafnia films.

Abstract: We present a vector atomic magnetometer based on applying a fast-rotating magnetic field to a pulsed $^{87}$Rb scalar atomic magnetometer. This method enables simultaneous measurements of the total magnetic field and two polar angles relative to the plane of magnetic field rotation. Using two channels in a gradiometer mode, it provides simultaneous measurements of the total field gradient with a sensitivity of 35 $\mathrm{fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ (0.7 part per billion), as well as two polar angles with resolutions of 6 $\mathrm{nrad/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 50 $\mu$T Earth field strength. The noise spectrums of these measurements are flat down to 1 Hz and 0.1 Hz, respectively. Crucially, this approach avoids several metrological difficulties associated with vector magnetometers and gradiometers. We detail the fundamental, systematic, and practical limits of such vector magnetometers. Notably, we provide a comprehensive study of the systematic effects of vector atomic magnetometers. We introduce a new concept of dynamic heading error and investigate several other systematic effects. A unique peak-altering fast rotating field modulation is proposed to cancel out these systematics. Additionally, we derive fundamental limits on the sensitivity of such sensors and demonstrate that the vector sensitivity of the sensor can approach its scalar sensitivity while retaining the accuracy and metrological advantages of scalar sensors. This high-dynamic-range vector magnetometer, with ultrahigh resolution and inherent calibration, is suitable for a wide array of applications.

Abstract: The Griffiths phase in systems with quenched disorder occurs below the ordering transition of the pure system down to the ordering transition of the actual disordered system. While it does not exhibit long-range order, large fluctuations in the disorder degrees of freedom result in exponentially rare, long-range ordered states and hence the occurrence of broad distributions in response functions. Inside the Griffiths phase of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility is expected to have such a broad, exponential tail. A large-deviations Monte Carlo algorithm is used to sample this distribution and the exponential tail is extracted over a wide range of the support down to very small probabilities of the order of $10^{-300}$. We study the behavior of the susceptibility distribution across the full phase diagram, from the paramagnetic state through the Griffiths phase to the ferromagnetically ordered system and down to the zero-temperature point. We extract the rate function of large-deviation theory as well as its finite-size scaling behavior and we reveal interesting differences and similarities between the cases. A connection between the fraction of ferromagnetic bonds in a given disorder sample and the size of the magnetic susceptibility is demonstrated numerically.

Low temperature coal tar (LTCT) is the preferred raw material for catalytic hydrogenation of coal tar. In order to study and popularize the technology of preparing fuel oil by hydrogenation of LTCT, it is necessary to research its composition and structural characteristics. Heavy hydrogenated coal tar (HHCT) from a company in Xinjiang, which is a mixture of hydrorefined tail oil distillate (&amp;gt;350 ℃) and hydrotreated circulating tail oil (&amp;gt;350 ℃). To make scientific and customized use of HHCT, the chemical composition and molecular structure characteristics of HHCT and its subcomponents were investigated using elemental analysis (EA), infrared analysis (FT-IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR and 13C-NMR) through fraction separation. Compared to other low-temperature coal tar (LTCT), the content of saturates (SA) in HHCT is 95.01wt%, considerably higher than other LTCT samples, and the content of aromatics (AR), resins (RE), and asphaltenes (AS) are all much lower than other LTCT samples. Compared with the basic properties, elemental content and refining performance of other crude oils, HHCT is good quality oil with relatively small density, high H/C ratio, fewer heteroatoms and low metal impurities, and is easy to refine and process. FT-IR and NMR results show that HHCT and SA are primarily constituted of long-chain n-alkanes possessing longer aliphatic chains and fewer branched chains. Aromatics are predominantly present in AR and mainly encompass bicyclic and tricyclic aromatics. HHCT and other fractions contain a small quantity of aromatic structures.

# Enhancing low-voltage ride-through capability of wind turbine based double-fed induction generator using ANFIS controller and crowbar circuit

## 使用ANFIS控制器和crowbar电路增强基于双馈感应发电机的风力发电机的低电压穿越能力

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5093339/latest

The ultimate target of this paper is to increase the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) of the Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) driven by wind turbine. This task is realized, initially, by inserting a crowbar circuit (CB) into rotor circuit, in case of voltage dip (VD), to guard it from high current and high voltage that could result from the transient flux produced by the VD. In case of no CB circuit, the system may be vulnerable to instability. Secondly, an ANFIS-controller is proposed to control both the rotor side converter (RSC) and the grid side converter (GSC). While the RSC controller regulates the electromagnetic torque, the GSC controller control both the real power and reactive power delivered to the system during normal operation conditions beside with it keeps the value of the dc link voltage fixed. To enhance the LVRT capabilities, the GSC is controlled such that it injects the necessary reactive power required during severe voltage dips to improve the LVRT capability of the DFIG. From the results, it is obvious that the hybrid ANFIS and CB circuit provide an improved LVRT responses in challenging operating conditions and within the acceptable criteria&rsquo;s.

A small size microstrip fed ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) antenna with quad band notch characteristics has been described in this paper. Band notch characteristics are achieved by loading dual number of two via double-slot type electromagnetic band gap (TVDS EBG) structures. The size of TVDS - EBG structure is less compared to other conventional EBG cells. Detailed parametric study, surface current distributions, input impedance and equivalent circuit model has been conducted to elucidate the operational mechanisms underlying notch band in the proposed antenna. The proposed antenna design has been put into practical use and measurement outcomes are portrayed to compare against simulation results that notable align well. Proposed design provides impedance matching from 2.91 to 11.62 GHz (for 2&amp;thinsp;&amp;le;&amp;thinsp;VSWR) with successful suppression of WiMAX (3.300&amp;ndash;3.700 GHz), WLAN (4.910&amp;ndash;5.350 GHz, and 5.630&amp;ndash;5.820 GHz) and X-band ITU (8.03&amp;ndash;8.50 GHz). The measured far-field radiation patterns are stable and group delay is almost constant in the whole operating frequency band. Thus the compact antenna might be an excellent candidate for UWB utilization..

# Study of Ionospheric Scintillations over Indian Region Using NavIC/IRNSS Signal

The IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) is an indigenously developed satellite system that provides round-the-clock, real-time navigational services over the Indian subcontinent. Ionospheric perturbations are the most severe threat to radio propagation. A parameter such as Total Electron Content (TEC) is a helpful indicator for understanding ionospheric dynamics. In this paper, the data obtained from the receiver stations at Panhala (Maharashtra) and Burdwan (West Bengal) are analyzed. The data is recorded at the frequency of 1 Hz. Derived parameters like STEC (Slant Total Electron Content), S4 Index of Scintillation were calculated. For a pointed study, the data was taken from only certain days characterized by heightened geomagnetic activity. In addition, particular emphasis was given to the variability of all the relevant parameters concerning the long-term solar cycle, i.e., solar maxima and minima. For the study of ionospheric composition during the maximum and minimum phase of the 24th solar cycle, data was collected from two different stations located at Bangalore and Hyderabad for the years corresponding to the solar maximum and solar minimum, and TEC was calculated for the concerned time. The diurnal variation of TEC as recorded by different receiver stations for a single day was also studied. The scintillation index S4 denotes how the signal is disturbed in its amplitude. Scintillation events are characterized based on their respective S4 index values as weak, moderate, and strong during solstice and equinox months in the solar maximum and minimum years.

# Characterizing Ionospheric TEC Gradients over Nigerian Longitudes During Increasing Phase of Solar Cycle #24

## 在太阳周期 #24的增加阶段表征尼日利亚经度上的电离层TEC梯度

Over the last decades, there has been growing interest in the characterization of ionospheric total electron content (TEC) for the effective planning, implementation and optimum performance of the satellite-based technology applications. This paper essentially examines the ionospheric TEC gradients using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data during the increasing phase of solar cycle 24, years 2011&amp;ndash;2013. The data used were mined from the African GNSS Network of stations (AFREF, www.afrefdata.org) and Nigeria GNSS ground-based Network Observation Stations (NIGNET) located within the belt of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) region. The ionospheric TEC gradients were analysed during distinct geomagnetic conditions. The monthly mean results have shown that ionospheric TEC gradients are dominant during the disturbed conditions when the ionospheric storm has positive phase leading to an increase in the ionization, while the ionospheric TEC gradients are lower during the quiet conditions when the ionospheric storm is in the negative phase and this is evidenced in the decreased ionization at the disturbed conditions. The study records that the magnitude of ionospheric gradients increases with solar activities and could be as high as 300 mm/km within the Nigeria longitudes at the high of solar activity and the conjugate distance may not solely be responsible for the magnitude ionospheric gradient observe spatially. The results of the bounding errors revealed that the ionospheric TEC gradients are not well bounded over the Nigerian longitudes during moderate to high solar activities, which could pose a serious challenge to the seamless GNSS critical applications in terms of navigation and positioning.

This method employs physically meaningful features to analyze the energy landscape, providing insights into the mechanisms behind function. We obtained features representing both the microstructure and energy of the domain wall. The causes of iron loss were traced to the original domain structure, through which we could successfully distinguish and visualize the role of pinning as a promoting and resisting factor. We found that the reversal process was governed not only by general grain boundary pinning but also by segmented magnetic domains within the grain. This method revealed the complex interplay between magnetism and metallography and introduced a new means for transformative material design, bridging structures and functions.
