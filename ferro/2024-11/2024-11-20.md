# On the Origin of $A$-type Antiferromagnetism and Chiral Split Magnons in Altermagnetic $\alpha$-MnTe

## 关于磁性 $ \ alpha $-MnTe中 $ A $ 型反铁磁性和手性分裂磁振子的起源

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11985

arXiv:2411.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the $A$-type antiferromagnetic ordering, where ferromagnetic layers couple antiferromagnetically, in the semiconductor altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe has been a subject of ongoing debate. Experimentally, $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits a nearest-neighbor in-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction, whereas previous ab initio calculations predicted an antiferromagnetic interaction. In this Letter, we resolve this discrepancy by considering an expanded set of magnetic configurations, which reveals an FM in-plane exchange interaction in agreement with experimental findings. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 10th nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is directionally dependent, inducing a chiral splitting in the magnon bands, as recently observed experimentally. We further show that applying a compressive strain reverses the sign of the in-plane exchange interaction and significantly enhances the spin and chiral splittings of the electronic and magnonic bands, respectively. Our results highlight the critical importance of convergence in the number of magnetic configurations for complex spin interactions in antiferromagnetic materials.

# Effect of Fe-doping on VS2 monolayer: A first-principles study

## Fe掺杂对VS2单层的影响: 第一性原理研究

arXiv:2411.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), like VS2, display unique electronic, magnetic, and optical properties, making them promising for spintronic and optoelectronic applications. Using first-principles calculations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT), we study the effect of Fe-doping on the electronic and magnetic properties of a VS2 monolayer. The pristine VS2 monolayer has ferromagnetic order and a small energy bandgap. This work aims to comprehensively study the substitution of selected Vanadium atoms in the VS2 monolayer by Iron (Fe) atoms, where the substitution concerns Vanadium atoms at various sites within the 2x2 and 3x3 supercells. This leads to significant modifications of the electronic band structure, magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE), and optical response (e.g., dielectric constant and absorption coefficient). The results provide valuable insights into engineering the VS2 monolayer properties for future applications, ranging from spintronics to cancer therapy in medical science.

# Easy-plane ferromagnetic ordering and crystal-field ground state in the Kondo lattice CeCuSi

## Kondo晶格CeCuSi中的易平面铁磁有序和晶场基态

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12054

arXiv:2411.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the successful growth of CeCuSi single crystals using a metallic flux method and the physical properties using structural, magnetic, electrical transport, optical, and heat capacity measurements. CeCuSi crystallizes in a hexagonal-bar shape, and single crystal x-ray diffraction confirms the ZrBeSi-type structure (space group $P6_{3}/mmc$). CeCuSi orders ferromagnetically below $T_\textrm{C}=15.5$ K with easy magnetization direction within the basal plane. The Ce$^{3+}$ ions are situated within a triangular lattice with a point group of $D_{3d}$. We perform a detailed crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility, the Schottky anomaly in heat capacity, and the Raman-active excitations. The results indicate a ground state doublet with magnetic moment primarily in the basal plane, and a ferromagnetic interaction along both directions. The exponential behavior in resistivity and in heat capacity below $T_\textrm{C}$ can also be well explained by the ferromagnetic magnon model. We found that CeCuSi does not exhibit the CEF hard axis ordering observed in many ferromagnetic Kondo lattice (FM-KL) compounds. Our CEF analysis suggests that the exchange interactions along both axes are ferromagnetic, potentially explaining the absence of hard-axis ordering.

# Magnetic ground state and excitations in mixed 3$d$-4$d$ quasi-1D spin-chain oxide Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$

Abstract: Entanglement of spin and orbital degrees of freedom, via relativistic spin-orbit coupling, in 4$d$ transition metal oxides can give rise to a variety of novel quantum phases. A previous study of mixed 3$d$-4$d$ quasi-1D spin-chain oxide Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$ using the magnetization measurements by Mohapatra et al. [Phys. Rev. B 75, 214422 (2007)] revealed a partially disordered antiferromagnetic (PDA) structure below 50 K [Mohapatra et al, Phys. Rev. B 75, 214422 (2007)]. We here report the magnetic ground state and spin-wave excitations in Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$, using muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR), and neutron (elastic and inelastic) scattering techniques. Our neutron diffraction study reveals that in the magnetic structure of Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$, Rh$^{4+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ spins are aligned ferromagnetically in a spin-chain, with moments along the crystallographic $c$-axis. However, spin-chains are coupled antiferromanetically in the $ab$-plane. $\mu$SR reveals the presence of oscillations in the asymmetry-time spectra below 50 K, supporting the long-range magnetically ordered ground state. Our inelastic neutron scattering study reveals gapped quasi-1D magnetic excitations with a large ratio of gap to exchange interaction. The observed spin-wave spectrum could be well fitted with a ferromagnetic isotropic exchange model (with $J = 3.7 $ meV) and single ion anisotropy ($D=10$ meV) on the Ni$^{2+}$ site. The magnetic excitations survive up to 85 K, well above the magnetic ordering temperature of $\sim 50$ K, also indicating a quasi-1D nature of the magnetic interactions in Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$.

Abstract: The unique connectivity of kagome lattices gives rise to topological properties, such as flat bands and Dirac cones. When combined with ferromagnetism and a chemical potential near the 2D Dirac points, this structure offers the potential to realize the highly sought-after topological Chern magnetotransport. Recently, there was considerable excitement surrounding this possibility in the ferrimagnetic kagome metal TbMn$_\mathbf{6}$Sn$_\mathbf{6}$. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the 2D Chern gap lies well above the Fermi energy, challenging its relevance in the observed anomalous Hall conductivity. Here, we investigate YMn$_\mathbf{6}$Sn$_\mathbf{5.45}$Ga$_\mathbf{0.55}$, a compound with similar crystallographic, magnetic, and electronic properties to TbMn$_\mathbf{6}$Sn$_\mathbf{6}$. Our findings show that the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in this material, while comparable in magnitude to that in TbMn$_\mathbf{6}$Sn$_\mathbf{6}$, is fully three-dimensional, thus providing experimental evidence that Hall conductivity in this class of materials does not originate from 2D Chern gaps. Additionally, we confirm that the newly proposed empirical scaling relation for extrinsic Hall conductivity is universally governed by spin fluctuations.

Abstract: We propose a generalization of the theory of magnetic Skyrmions in chiral magnets in two dimensions to a higher-dimensional theory with magnetic Skyrmions in three dimensions and an $S^3$ target space, requiring a 4-dimensional magnetization vector. A physical realization of our theory necessitates the use of a synthetic dimension, recently promoted and realized in condensed matter physics. In the simplest incarnation of the theory, we find a Skyrmion and a sphaleron - the latter being an unstable soliton. Including also the Skyrme term in theory enriches the spectrum to a small metastable Skyrmion, an unstable sphaleron and a large stable Skyrmion.

# Dynamic Control of Coupling Regimes in Oscillator Systems via Tunable Open Channels

## 通过可调开放通道动态控制振荡器系统中的耦合状态

arXiv:2411.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a system comprising two oscillators that are coupled to an open channel at distinct locations. The coupling nature can be adjusted to be coherent, dissipative, or a combination of both, controlled by a tunable phase resulting from wave propagation between the oscillators. This setup allows us to observe characteristic energy level behaviors: level repulsion occurs with coherent coupling, while level attraction is observed with dissipative coupling. In the regime of dissipative coupling, one of the eigenmodes becomes a dark mode, rendering it immune to external perturbations. By leveraging the tunable coupling through the open channel, we introduce a novel method for manipulating this dark mode, achieving both efficient excitation and an extended lifetime. Our results have broad applicability across various physical systems, including optical, acoustic, and magnetic configurations, underscoring the potential for innovative applications in mode storage and signal processing.

arXiv:2411.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of layered superconductors can vary drastically when thinned down from bulk to monolayer, owing to the reduced dimensionality and weakened interlayer coupling. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the inherent symmetry breaking effect in atomically thin crystals prompts novel states of matter, such as Ising superconductivity with an extraordinary in-plane upper critical field. Here, we demonstrate that two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity resembling those in atomic layers but with more fascinating behaviours can be realized in the bulk crystals of two new TMD-based superconductors Ba0.75ClTaS2 and Ba0.75ClTaSe2. They comprise an alternating stack of H-type TMD layers and Ba-Cl layers. In both materials, intrinsic 2D superconductivity develops below a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The upper critical field along ab plane exceeds the Pauli limit (Hp); in particular, Ba0.75ClTaSe2 exhibits an extremely high in plane Hc2 (14Hp) and a colossal superconducting anisotropy of 150. Moreover, the temperature-field phase diagram of Ba0.75ClTaSe2 under an in-plane magnetic field contains a large phase regime of vortex dissipation, which can be ascribed to the Josephson vortex motion, signifying an unprecedentedly strong fluctuation effect in TMD-based superconductors. Our results provide a new path towards the establishment of 2D superconductivity and novel exotic quantum phases in bulk crystals of TMD-based superconductors.

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit many unexpected properties including two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity as the interlayer coupling being weakened upon either layer-number reduction or chemical intercalation. Here we report the realization of 2D superconductivity in the newly-synthesized niobium dichalcogenides-based bulk superlattices Ba$_{0.75}$ClNbS$_{2}$ and Ba$_{0.75}$ClNbSe$_{2}$, which consists of the alternating stacking of monolayer $H$-NbS$_{2}$ (or $H$-NbSe$_{2}$) and monolayer inorganic insulator spacer Ba$_{0.75}$Cl. Magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements show that both superlattices belong to type-II superconductor with $T_{c}$ of 1 K and 1.25 K, respectively. Intrinsic 2D superconductivity is confirmed for both compounds below a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and a large anisotropy of the upper critical field. Furthermore, the upper critical field along $ab$ plane ($H_{c2}^{\parallel ab}$) exceeds the Pauli limit ($\mu_{0}H_{p}$) in Ba$_{0.75}$ClNbSe$_{2}$, highlighting the influence of spin-orbit interactions. Our results establish a generic method for realizing the 2D superconducting properties in bulk superlattice materials.

arXiv:2411.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear dipole textures greatly extend the scientific merits and application perspective of ferroic materials. In fact, noncollinear spin textures have been well recognized as one of the core issues of condensed matter, e.g. cycloidal/conical magnets with multiferroicity and magnetic skyrmions with topological properties. However, the counterparts in electrical polarized materials are less studied and thus urgently needed, since electric dipoles are usually aligned collinearly in most ferroelectrics/antiferroelectrics. Molecular crystals with electric dipoles provide a rich ore to explore the noncollinear polarity. Here we report an organic salt (H2Dabco)BrClO4 (H2Dabco = N,N'-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) that shows a transition between the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases. Based on experimental characterizations and ab initio calculations, it is found that its electric dipoles present nontrivial noncollinear textures with $60^\circ$-twisting angle between the neighbours. Then the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric transition can be understood as the coding of twisting angle sequence. Our study reveals the unique science of noncollinear electric polarity.

# Stripe Antiferromagnetic Ground State of FeSe Revealed by Density Functional Theory

arXiv:2411.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic ground state of iron selenide (FeSe) has been a topic of debate, with experimental evidence suggesting stripe spin fluctuations as predominant at low temperatures, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) have historically predicted the antiferromagnetic (AFM) dimer configuration. In this study, we utilize the $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ functional, a variant of the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed ($\text{SCAN}$) meta-GGA, to investigate the magnetic configurations of FeSe. Our findings indicate that $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ predicts a stripe-AFM ground state with an anti-parallel spin alignment between layers. The energy difference between the parallel and anti-parallel inter-planar spin alignments is approximately 1.7 meV/atom, predicting a significant but previously unreported interlayer spin coupling not yet observed by experiments. This study underscores the importance of accurate exchange-correlation functionals, such as $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$, in predicting the magnetic ground state in complex materials like FeSe, highlighting its potential to predict magnetic interactions more reliably than traditional GGA functionals by adhering to exact constraints.

# Double Splay Nematic Order in Confined Polar Fluids

## 受限极性流体中的双向列序

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12336

arXiv:2411.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate that when a ferroelectric nematic is confined between two glass plates coated with ionic polymers, a modulated phase emerges in a narrow temperature range between the nematic and ferroelectric nematic phases. This modulated phase emerges from the nematic phase in a continuous manner and then transforms into the ferroelectric nematic phase via a first-order transition upon cooling. Using optical microscopy, we provide compelling evidence that this modulated phase corresponds to the theoretically predicted double splay nematic phase. In this phase, splay deformations alternate in two orthogonal directions oriented at 45{\deg} to the substrate surfaces, creating a modulation wavelength that is twice the thickness of the cell. Our experiments with different ionic coatings reveal that only polymeric cationic coatings effectively promote the formation of this phase, highlighting the critical role of electrical screening. These findings not only confirm the existence of the double splay nematic phase but also provide insights into the distinctive topological defects of this phase in confined geometries.

# Fractality-induced Topology

arXiv:2411.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal geometries, characterized by self-similar patterns and non-integer dimensions, provide an intriguing platform for exploring topological phases of matter. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that leverages isospectral reduction to effectively simplify complex fractal structures, revealing the presence of topologically protected boundary and corner states. Our approach demonstrates that fractals can support topological phases, even in the absence of traditional driving mechanisms such as magnetic fields or spin-orbit coupling. The isospectral reduction not only elucidates the underlying topological features but also makes this framework broadly applicable to a variety of fractal systems. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these topological phases may naturally occur in materials with fractal structures found in nature. This work opens new avenues for designing fractal-based topological materials, advancing both theoretical understanding and experimental exploration of topology in complex, self-similar geometries.

# Spin-density wave and superconductivity in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under ambient pressure

## 大气压下La $_4 $ Ni $_3 $ O $_{10}$ 中的自旋密度波和超导电性

arXiv:2411.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-density wave (SDW) behavior and the potential for superconductivity (SC) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under ambient pressure using a multi-orbital random-phase approximation (RPA). Starting with a twelve-orbital tight-binding model derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the influence of Hubbard interactions on SDW formation. Our analysis reveals a stripe-like SDW characterized by an incommensurate wave vector, $Q\approx(\pm 0.7\pi,0)$, suggesting a possible density wave instability in agreement with recent experiments. This configuration is driven by nesting of outer-layer Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbitals and exhibits interlayer antiferromagnetic ordering between the top and bottom NiO layers, with the middle layer serving as a node. We demonstrate that the Hund's coupling $J_H$ is the primary driver of the observed SDW. While superconductivity is absent in the undoped system under ambient pressure, it becomes attainable with appropriate hole doping ($\delta=-0.4$), resulting in a SC gap structure similar to the high-pressure phase. Our study identifies the specific conditions for realizing the ambient pressure stripe density wave: $J_H>0.16U$. Additionally, when doping leads to sufficient nesting at (0,0), the system's magnetic fluctuations transition into a stable Neel-type antiferromagnetic state, analogous to the high-pressure case.

# Emergent surface multiferroicity

## 涌现表面多铁性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12434

arXiv:2411.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the surface of a centrosymmetric, collinear, compensated antiferromagnet, which hosts bulk ferroically ordered magnetic octupoles, exhibits a linear magnetoelectric effect, a net magnetization, and a net electric dipole moment. Thus, the surface satisfies all the conditions of a multiferroic, in striking contrast to the bulk, which is neither polar nor exhibits any net magnetization or linear magnetoelectric response. Of particular interest is the case of non-relativistic $d$-wave spin split antiferromagnets, in which the bulk magnetic octupoles and consequently the surface multiferroicity exist even without spin-orbit interaction. We illustrate our findings using first-principles calculations, taking FeF$_2$ as an example material. Our work underscores the bulk-boundary correspondence in these unconventional antiferromagnets.

Abstract: This study investigates the nucleation, dynamics, and stationary configurations of Abrikosov vortices in hybrid superconductor-ferromagnetic nanostructures exposed to inhomogeneous magnetic fields generated by a ferromagnetic nanodot. Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations and Maxwell's equations, we observe and provide an explanation for the evolution of curved vortex structures that undergo creep-like deformation while reaching a steady state. Spatial variations in the Lorentz force, along with the interaction between geometric constraints and vortex interactions, give rise to unusual stationary vortex configurations that gradually change with increasing field strength, a behavior not seen in homogeneous magnetic fields. These findings reveal complex pinning mechanisms, providing valuable insights for the optimization and further advancement of nanoscale superconducting systems.

# Vanishing conductivity-like Gilbert damping in mirror-symmetric van der Waals ferromagnets

arXiv:2411.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnetic materials has significantly expanded the realm of magnetic materials and enabled innovative control techniques such as gating and stacking. The dynamical behavior of magnetization is profoundly influenced by the Gilbert damping parameter, a crucial factor for enhancing the speed of magnetic switching and reducing the energy consumption of magnetic devices. Despite its importance, the understanding of Gilbert damping in van der Waals ferromagnets remains limited, impeding their technological applications. Here we present a theoretical calculation of Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals metals, focusing on Fe3GaTe2 and Fe3GeTe2 as model systems. We discover that mirror symmetry prohibits intraband contributions, resulting in disappearance of conductivity-like damping. Consequently, at low temperatures, the Gilbert damping in single-layer Fe3GaTe2 and Fe3GeTe2 is remarkably low when the magnetization is perpendicular to the atomic layer, but it increases substantially when the magnetization is reoriented into the atomic plane. Furthermore, topological nodal lines, also protected by mirror symmetry, contribute significantly to damping mediated by interband transitions and can be effectively modulated by adjusting the Fermi level. Our findings elucidate the distinctive characteristics of Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnets, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of low-dimensional spintronic devices.

arXiv:2411.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in aberration corrected electron microscopy necessitates development of robust methods for the identification of phases, ferroic variants, and other pertinent aspects of materials structure from imaging data. While unsupervised methods for clustering and classification are widely used for these tasks, their performance can be sensitive to hyperparameter selection in the analysis workflow. In this study, we explore the effects of descriptors and hyperparameters on the capability of unsupervised ML methods to distill local structural information, exemplified by discovery of polarization and lattice distortion in Sm doped BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films. We demonstrate that a reward-driven approach can be used to optimize these key hyperparameters across the full workflow, where rewards were designed to reflect domain wall continuity and straightness, ensuring that the analysis aligns with the material's physical behavior. This approach allows us to discover local descriptors that are best aligned with the specific physical behavior, providing insight into the fundamental physics of materials. We further extend the reward driven workflows to disentangle structural factors of variation via optimized variational autoencoder (VAE). Finally, the importance of well-defined rewards was explored as a quantifiable measure of success of the workflow.

Abstract: Ultrathin magnetic films on heavy metal substrates with strong spin-orbit coupling provide versatile platforms for exploring novel spin textures. So far, structurally open fcc(110) substrates remain largely terra incognita. Here, we stabilize a metastable, unreconstructed Ir(110)-$(1 \times 1)$ surface supporting two layers of Fe. Combining spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and ab initio calculations, we reveal a right-handed N\'eel-type spin spiral along the [$\overline{1}10$] crystallographic direction with a period of 1.27~nm as the magnetic ground state. Our analysis reveals this spiral is of the Yoshimori type, i.e., driven by frustrated Heisenberg interactions, with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction determining its cycloidal nature and handedness.

arXiv:2411.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Casimir effect originating from Dirac fields in finite-density matter under a magnetic field. In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.

# Quantum teleportation with dissimilar quantum dots over a hybrid quantum network

Abstract: Photonic quantum information processing in metropolitan quantum networks lays the foundation for cloud quantum computing [1, 2], secure communication [3, 4], and the realization of a global quantum internet [5, 6]. This paradigm shift requires on-demand and high-rate generation of flying qubits and their quantum state teleportation over long distances [7]. Despite the last decade has witnessed an impressive progress in the performances of deterministic photon sources [8-11], the exploitation of distinct quantum emitters to implement all-photonic quantum teleportation among distant parties has remained elusive. Here, we overcome this challenge by using dissimilar quantum dots whose electronic and optical properties are engineered by light-matter interaction [12], multi-axial strain [13] and magnetic fields [14] so as to make them suitable for the teleportation of polarization qubits. This is demonstrated in a hybrid quantum network harnessing both fiber connections and 270 m free-space optical link connecting two buildings of the University campus in the center of Rome. The protocol exploits GPS-assisted synchronization, ultra-fast single photon detectors as well as stabilization systems that compensate for atmospheric turbulence. The achieved teleportation state fidelity reaches up to 82+-1%, above the classical limit by more than 10 standard deviations. Our field demonstration of all-photonic quantum teleportation opens a new route to implement solid-state based quantum relays and builds the foundation for practical quantum networks.

# When Theory Meets Experiment: What Does it Take to Accurately Predict $^1$H NMR Dipolar Relaxation Rates in Neat Liquid Water from Theory?

Abstract: In this contribution, we compute the $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of liquid water at ambient conditions. We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while considering also nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate of spin $1/2$ nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions, and is including a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical informations from CCMD trajectories are considered including a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, according to the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H-H vector $D_0\times\tau_\mathrm{HH}$. The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contribution to the $^1$H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike to what was predicted earlier from classical MD simulations.

Abstract: In this letter, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that in the Gaussian approximation, the contribution of ionic fluctuations is separate from the contribution of electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", which was previously used on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to other researchers based on the Lifshitz theory.

arXiv:2106.11694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the ac response represent a valuable method for probing the properties of superconductors. In the surface superconducting state (SSS), a current exceeding the surface critical current $I_\mathrm{c}$ leads to breakdown of SSS and penetration of external magnetic field into the sample bulk. An interesting free-of-bulk system in SSS is offered by thin-walled cylinders. According to the full penetration of magnetic flux (FPMF) model, each time the instant value of an ac field is equal to a certain critical value, the ac susceptibility $\chi$ will exhibit \emph{jumps} as a function of the ac field amplitude $H_\mathrm{ac}$ because of the periodic destruction and restoration of SSS in the cylinder wall. Here we study the low-frequency (128-8192\,Hz) ac response of thin-walled niobium cylinders under superimposed dc and ac magnetic fields applied parallel to the cylinder axis. In contrast to the FPMF model predictions, experiments reveal a \emph{smooth} $\chi(H_\mathrm{ac})$ dependence. To explain the experimental observations, we propose a phenomenological \emph{partial} penetration magnetic flux (PPMF) model, which assumes that after restoration of the superconducting state, the magnetic fields inside and outside the cylinder are unequal and the magnitude of the penetrating flux is random for every penetration. This model fits very well the experimental data on the temperature dependence of the first harmonic $\chi_1$ for any dc field and ac amplitude.

# Fate of surface gaps in magnetic topological insulators

arXiv:2404.18917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, the surface states can exhibit a gap due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Various experiments, while suggesting the existence of the surface gap, have raised questions about its underlying mechanism in the presence of different magnetic orderings. Here, we demonstrate that magnon-mediated electron-electron interactions, whose effects are not limited to the surfaces perpendicular to the magnetic ordering, can significantly influence surface states and their effective gaps. On the surfaces perpendicular to the spin quantization axis, many-body interactions can enhance the band gap to a degree that surpasses the non-interacting scenario. Then, on surfaces parallel to the magnetic ordering, we find that strong magnon-induced fermionic interactions can lead to features resembling a massless-like gap. These remarkable results largely stem from the fact that magnon-mediated interactions exhibit considerable long-range behavior compared to direct Coulomb interactions among electrons, thereby dominating the many-body properties at the surface of magnetic topological insulators.

Abstract: Identifying the superconducting gap symmetry and topological signatures in the putative spin-triplet superconductor $\text{UTe}_2$ is an important issue. Especially, a smoking-gun detection scheme for Majorana surface states hallmarking topological superconductivity in $\text{UTe}_2$ is still lacking. In this study, we examine the surface spin susceptibility of $\text{UTe}_2$ with a particular focus on the contribution of the surface states. We find that Majorana surface states contribute significantly to the surface spin susceptibility, and give rise to an Ising-like anisotropy and anomalous enhancement in the surface spin susceptibility. We calculate the surface spin susceptibility as well as the local density of states using the recursive Green's function method and examine the anisotropy of the surface spin susceptibility in terms of the topological surface states and symmetry for all irreducible representations of odd-parity pairing states. Our results indicate that the Ising anisotropy and the anomalous enhancement are attributed to the Majorana surface state protected by the crystalline symmetry. These findings suggest the possibility of detecting the Majorana surface state via magnetic measurements.

Abstract: The magnetic Skyrmion is described by one control parameter and one length scale. We study the two extreme limits of the control parameter - infinitely large and vanishing - and find that the magnetic Skyrmion becomes a "restricted" magnetic Skyrmion and an O(3) sigma model lump, respectively. Depending on the potential under consideration, the restricted limit manifests differently. In the case of the Zeeman term, the restricted magnetic Skyrmion becomes a "supercompacton" that develops a discontinuity, whereas for the Zeeman term to the power 3/2 it becomes a normal compacton. In both the lump and the restricted limit the solution is given in exact explicit form. We observe that the case of the Zeeman term squared, which can also be understood as a special combination of the Zeeman term and the easy-plane potential - realizable in the laboratory, the analytically exact solution for all values of the coupling - including the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) case - is also of the lump type. Finally, we notice that certain materials (e.g. Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si or Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge) have a rather large control parameter $\epsilon$ of order 100, making the restricted limit a suitable rough approximation.

Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice Ba4Nb1-xRu3+xO12 is believed to feature a heavy spinon Fermi surface that underpins both a quantum spin liquid (QSL) and an adjacent heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM) phase, depending on Nb content. Itinerant spinons act as heat carriers that render the charge-insulating QSL a much better thermal conductor than the HFSM [1]. We find application of magnetic fields up to 14 T below 150 mK induces an abrupt rise in the heat capacity by as much as 5000% and breaks the signature linear temperature dependences of the heat capacity of both phases. In contrast, the AC magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity are insensitive to applied fields up to 14 T over the same milli-Kelvin temperature range, whereas field depresses the thermal conductivity by up to 40% at temperatures below 4 K. These complex phenomena imply applied magnetic field drastically alters the spinons at low temperatures and demand new physics: We propose the steep rise in the heat capacity (and thus entropy) at milli-Kelvin temperatures and strong magnetic fields announces a field-induced localization of spinons.

Abstract: The effect of correlations in disorder variables is a largely unexplored topic in spin glass theory. We study this problem through a specific example of correlated disorder introduced in the Ising spin glass model. We prove that the distribution function of the magnetization along the Nishimori line in the present model is identical to the distribution function of the spin glass order parameter in the standard Edwards-Anderson model with symmetrically-distributed independent disorder. This result means that if the Edwards-Anderson model exhibits replica symmetry breaking, the magnetization distribution in the correlated model has support on a finite interval, in sharp contrast to the conventional understanding that the magnetization distribution has at most two delta peaks. This unusual behavior challenges the traditional argument against replica symmetry breaking on the Nishimori line in the Edwards-Anderson model. In addition, we show that when temperature chaos is present in the Edwards-Anderson model, the ferromagnetic phase is strictly confined to the Nishimori line in the present model. These findings are valid not only for finite-dimensional systems but also for the infinite-range model, and highlight the need for a deeper understanding of disorder correlations in spin glass systems.

Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) oscillations serve as a hallmark of intrinsic quantum behavior, traditionally observed only in conducting systems. Here we report the discovery of MR oscillations in an insulating system, the vertical junctions of CrPS$_4$ which is a two dimensional (2D) A-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor. Systematic investigations of MR peaks under varying conditions, including electrode materials, magnetic field direction, temperature, voltage bias and layer number, elucidate a correlation between MR oscillations and spin-canted states in CrPS$_4$. Experimental data and analysis point out the important role of the in-gap electronic states in generating MR oscillations, and we proposed that spin selected interlayer hopping of localized defect states may be responsible for it. Our findings not only illuminate the unusual electronic transport in CrPS$_4$ but also underscore the potential of van der Waals magnets for exploring interesting phenomena.

Abstract: We discuss the Josephson vortices in planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, where the TI section is narrow and long. We are motivated by recent experiments, especially by those in junctions of Corbino ring geometry, where non-zero critical current was observed at low temperatures even if a non-zero phase winding number (fluxoid) was enforced in the ring by the perpendicular magnetic field. In this paper we focus on the "atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit we can associate the non-vanishing critical current with the irregularities (disorder) in the junction's width. We also discuss the microwave spectroscopy of the Josephson vortices in the atomic limit and observe particularly simple selection rules for the allowed transitions.

arXiv:2411.11586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field and the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We demonstrate that they are beyond the semi-classical picture, as the exponential prefactor indicates quantum tunneling between distinct quantum states. We draw a picture of these quantum oscillations, in which the linear dispersion of the semi-Dirac band in the cadmium plays a crucial role. The oscillations arise by the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement. Positive and negative corrections to semi-classical magneto-conductance can occur by alternation between destructive and constructive interference in phase-coherent helical states. The quantum limit of Sondheimer oscillations emerges as another manifestation of Aharanov-Bohm flux quantization.

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11865

arXiv:2411.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the Z-Pinch fusion process, electric current is injected into liquid metal from the plasma column, generating Lorentz forces that deform the liquid metal's free surface. Modeling this phenomenon is essential for assessing the feasibility of using liquid metal as an electrode wall in fusion devices. Traditionally, such problems, where liquid metal is exposed to electromagnetic forces, are modeled using magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) formulation, which is more suitable for cases without external electric current penetration into liquid metals. MHD formulation typically models situations where liquid metal flows in the presence of an external magnetic field, with the initial magnetic field known and evolving over time via the magnetic induction equation. However, in Z-Pinch fusion devices, the electric current penetrates and traverses through the liquid metal, necessitating numerical calculations for the initial magnetic field. Additionally, the deformation of the liquid metal surface alters the current path's geometry and the resulting magnetic field, rendering traditional MHD formulations unsuitable. This work addresses this issue by directly solving Maxwell's equations, instead of the magnetic induction equation, in combination with Navier-Stokes equations, making it possible to predict the magnetic field even when the fluid is in motion. The Maxwell equations are solved in potential formulation alongside Navier-Stokes equations using a finite volume numerical method on a collocated grid arrangement. This proposed numerical framework successfully captures the deformation of the liquid metal's free surface due to the applied electric current.

Abstract: This study uses fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation to investigate the effects of anomalous diffusion on electron transport and the propulsive performance of magnetic nozzles (MN) typical of low-power cathode-less RF plasma thrusters. The analysis provides insights into how this non-collisional transport mechanism, driven by turbulence and wave-particle interactions, influences the formation of azimuthal electron currents and, consequently, impacts thrust generation, momentum/power balance, and propulsive efficiency metrics. A Bohm-type anomalous collisionality is applied to the case of a the 150 W class REGULUS-150-Xe thruster at low (30 W) and high (150 W) operating conditions. It is found that the enhanced cross-field transport of electrons inhibits the formation of the typical MN potential barrier, reducing the radial confinement. The downstream potential drop is reduced by up to 15%. Diamagnetic electron current is diminished in the absence of steep pressure gradients and the $E\times B$ current becomes purely paramagnetic. The MN efficiency is cut from circa 0.5 to 0.2 due to loss of electron thermal energy conversion and increased plume divergence. At the Bohm limit of $\omega_{ce}/16$, agreement to experimental thrust profiles of <20% is achieved in contrast to 48% overestimation at high-power in the classical case.

Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study temporal interfaces between media with strong spatial dispersion and dielectrics. In particular, we consider a temporal discontinuity that transforms a wire medium sample, a metamaterial with resonant spatial dispersion, into a uniaxial dielectric. We show that this transition results in a transformation of the deeply subwavelength spatial spectrum of TEM waves propagating in the wire medium at a certain frequency into a spectrum of plane waves at new frequencies that are all higher than the initial one. The waves at different frequencies propagate in different directions. Their complex amplitudes and propagation directions are uniquely related to the amplitudes of the spatial harmonics of the fields which existed before the transition. We explain how to implement this transition. The revealed effect may result in a promising method of subwavelength imaging.

Abstract: Alkali-metal-noble-gas comagnetometers are precision probes well-suited for tests of fundamental physics and inertial rotation sensing, combining high sensitivity of the spin-exchange-relaxation free (SERF) magnetometers with inherent suppression of magnetic field noise. Past versions of the device utilizing continuous-wave optical pumping are sensitive to a single axis perpendicular to the plane spanned by the orthogonal pump and probe laser beams. These devices are susceptible to light shifts in the alkali atoms, and to power and beam pointing fluctuations of both the probe and pump lasers, the latter of which is a dominant source of $1/f$ noise. In this work, we model and implement a new approach to alkali-metal-noble-gas comagnetometers using pulsed optical pumping. After each pump laser pulse, an off-resonance probe beam measures the precession of noble-gas-spins-coupled alkali spins via optical rotation in the dark, thus eliminating effects from pump laser light shift and power fluctuations. Performing non-linear fitting on the sinusoidal transient signal with a proper phase enables separate and simultaneous measurement of signals along two orthogonal axes in the plane perpendicular to the pump beam. Effects from beam pointing fluctuations of the probe beam in the pump-probe plane is fundamentally eliminated, and signal response to pump beam pointing fluctuations is suppressed by compensation from noble-gas nuclear spins.

arXiv:2411.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have the potential to enhance technical expertise in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of operator skill or geographic location.
  Methods: We assessed the accuracy of several LLMs in answering 570 technical MRI questions derived from a standardized review book. The questions spanned nine MRI topics, including Basic Principles, Image Production, and Safety. Closed-source models (e.g., OpenAI's o1 Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and Claude 3.5 Haiku) and open-source models (e.g., Phi 3.5 Mini, Llama 3.1, smolLM2) were tested. Models were queried using standardized prompts via the LangChain framework, and responses were graded against correct answers using an automated scoring protocol. Accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct answers, was the primary outcome.
  Results: The closed-source o1 Preview model achieved the highest accuracy (94%), exceeding the random-guess baseline (26.5%). GPT-4o and o1 Mini scored 88%, and GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Haiku each scored 84%. Among open-source models, Phi 3.5 Mini performed well, achieving 78% accuracy, comparable to several closed-source models. Accuracy was highest in Basic Principles and Instrumentation categories but lower in Image Weighting and Contrast, History, and Artifacts and Corrections.
  Conclusions: LLMs exhibit high accuracy in addressing technical MRI questions, suggesting their potential to standardize and enhance MRI practice. These models may improve image quality and consistency across varied clinical environments. Further studies are needed to refine LLMs for clinical use and integrate them into MRI workflows.

arXiv:2411.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The opening or closing mechanism of a voltage-gated ion channel is triggered by the potential difference crossing the cell membrane in the nervous system. Based on this picture, we model the ion channel as a nanoscale two-terminal ionic tunneling junction. External time-varying voltage exerting on the two-terminal ionic tunneling junction mimics the stimulation of neurons from the outside. By deriving the quantum Langevin equation from quantum mechanics, the ion channel current is obtained by the quantum tunneling of ions controlled by the time-varying voltage. The time-varying voltage induces an effective magnetic flux which causes quantum coherence in ion tunnelings and leads to sideband effects in the ion channel current dynamics. The sideband effects in the ionic current dynamics manifest a multi-crossing hysteresis in the I-V curve, which is the memory dynamics responding to the variation of the external voltage. Such memory dynamics is defined as the active quantum memory with respect to the time-varying stimuli. We can quantitatively describe how active quantum memory is generated and changed. We find that the number of the non-zero cross points in the I-V curve hysteresis and the oscillation of the differential conductance are the characteristics for quantitatively describing the active quantum memory. We also explore the temperature dependence of the active quantum memory in such a system. The discovery of this active quantum memory characteristics provides a new understanding about the underlying mechanism of ion channel dynamics.

Abstract: Forecasting the geomagnetic effects of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is currently an unsolved problem. CMEs, responsible for the largest values of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field, are the key driver of intense and extreme geomagnetic activity. Observations of southward interplanetary magnetic fields are currently only accessible through in situ measurements by spacecraft in the solar wind. On 10-12 May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm since 2003 took place, caused by five interacting CMEs. We clarify the relationship between the CMEs, their solar source regions, and the resulting signatures at the Sun-Earth L1 point observed by the ACE spacecraft at 1.00 AU. The STEREO-A spacecraft was situated at 0.956 AU and 12.6{\deg} west of Earth during the event, serving as a fortuitous sub-L1 monitor providing interplanetary magnetic field measurements of the solar wind. We demonstrate an extension of the prediction lead time, as the shock was observed 2.57 hours earlier at STEREO-A than at L1, consistent with the measured shock speed at L1, 710 km/s, and the radial distance of 0.04 AU. By deriving the geomagnetic indices based on the STEREO-A beacon data, we show that the strength of the geomagnetic storm would have been decently forecasted, with the modeled minimum SYM-H=-478.5 nT, underestimating the observed minimum by only 8%. Our study sets an unprecedented benchmark for future mission design using upstream monitoring for space weather prediction.

# When Theory Meets Experiment: What Does it Take to Accurately Predict $^1$H NMR Dipolar Relaxation Rates in Neat Liquid Water from Theory?

Abstract: In this contribution, we compute the $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of liquid water at ambient conditions. We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while considering also nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate of spin $1/2$ nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions, and is including a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical informations from CCMD trajectories are considered including a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, according to the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H-H vector $D_0\times\tau_\mathrm{HH}$. The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contribution to the $^1$H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike to what was predicted earlier from classical MD simulations.

# Energy balance for 6D kinetic ions with adiabatic electrons

Abstract: This paper investigates the energy fluxes for the 6D kinetic Vlasov system. We introduce a novel method for calculating particle and energy flows within this framework which allows for the determination of energy and particle fluxes, as well as the Poynting flux, directly from the system's moments such as kinetic energy density, momentum transfer tensor. The fluxes computed using the new method exhibit fewer gyrooscillations. This approach also enables the identification of both the gyrokinetic $\vec{E} \times \vec{B}$ heat flux and additional non-gyrokinetic contributions, while simultaneously reducing inherent gyrooscillations in the energy and particle fluxes. Our semi-Lagrangian solver for the 6D kinetic Vlasov system, features a highly efficient scheme to address the $\vec v \times \vec B$ acceleration from the strong background magnetic field allows for the simulation of plasma waves and turbulence with frequencies extending beyond the cyclotron frequency, independent of gradient strength or fluctuation levels. The solver has been rigorously tested in the low-frequency regime for dispersion relations and energy fluxes in both linear and nonlinear scenarios.

Abstract: Photonic quantum information processing in metropolitan quantum networks lays the foundation for cloud quantum computing [1, 2], secure communication [3, 4], and the realization of a global quantum internet [5, 6]. This paradigm shift requires on-demand and high-rate generation of flying qubits and their quantum state teleportation over long distances [7]. Despite the last decade has witnessed an impressive progress in the performances of deterministic photon sources [8-11], the exploitation of distinct quantum emitters to implement all-photonic quantum teleportation among distant parties has remained elusive. Here, we overcome this challenge by using dissimilar quantum dots whose electronic and optical properties are engineered by light-matter interaction [12], multi-axial strain [13] and magnetic fields [14] so as to make them suitable for the teleportation of polarization qubits. This is demonstrated in a hybrid quantum network harnessing both fiber connections and 270 m free-space optical link connecting two buildings of the University campus in the center of Rome. The protocol exploits GPS-assisted synchronization, ultra-fast single photon detectors as well as stabilization systems that compensate for atmospheric turbulence. The achieved teleportation state fidelity reaches up to 82+-1%, above the classical limit by more than 10 standard deviations. Our field demonstration of all-photonic quantum teleportation opens a new route to implement solid-state based quantum relays and builds the foundation for practical quantum networks.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the structure and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the heliosphere remains one of the most sought-after goals in heliophysics and space weather research. A powerful tool for improving current knowledge and capabilities consists of multi-spacecraft observations of the same event, which take place when two or more spacecraft fortuitously find themselves in the path of a single CME. Multi-probe events can not only supply useful data to evaluate the large-scale of CMEs from 1D in-situ trajectories, but also provide additional constraints and validation opportunities for CME propagation models. In this work, we analyse and simulate the coronal and heliospheric evolution of a slow, streamer-blowout CME that erupted on 23 September 2021 and was encountered in situ by four spacecraft approximately equally distributed in heliocentric distance between 0.4 and 1 au. We employ the Open Solar Physics Rapid Ensemble Information (OSPREI) modelling suite in ensemble mode to predict the CME arrival and structure in a hindcast fashion and to compute the "best-fit" solutions at the different spacecraft individually and together. We find that the spread in the predicted quantities increases with heliocentric distance, suggesting that there may be a maximum (angular and radial) separation between an inner and an outer probe beyond which estimates of the in-situ magnetic field orientation (parameterised by flux rope model geometry) increasingly diverge. We discuss the importance of these exceptional observations and the results of our investigation in the context of advancing our understanding of CME structure and evolution as well as improving space weather forecasts.

# Transverse instability of electron-acoustic solitons in a relativistic degenerate astrophysical magnetoplasma

Abstract: We study the nonlinear theory of small-amplitude electron-acoustic solitons (EASs) in a relativistic astrophysical magnetoplasma consisting of two-temperature electrons: a sparse population of relativistic nondegenerate classical electrons and a group of fully degenerate dense relativistic electrons (main constituent) immersed in a static magnetic field with a neutralizing stationary ion background. By using the multiple-scale reductive perturbation technique with the Lorentz transformation, the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov (mZK) equations are derived to describe the evolution of EASs in two different regimes of relativistic degeneracy: $r_{d0}<50$ and $r_{d0}\gtrsim50$. The characteristics of the plane soliton solutions of ZK and mZK equations and the soliton energy are studied. We show that the solitons moving at an angle $\alpha$ to the external magnetic field can be unstable under transverse long-wavelength perturbations. The growth rates of instabilities are obtained and analyzed with the effects of the relativity parameter $\beta_{\rm{cl}}=k_BT_{\rm{cl}}/m_ec^2$ and the degeneracy parameter $r_{d0}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T_{\rm{cl}}$ is the temperature of classical electrons. Interestingly, the ZK solitons, even if it is stable for the first-order perturbations, can be unstable in the second-order correction. Furthermore, while the first-order growth rates of perturbations for ZK solitons tend to vanish as $\alpha\rightarrow 38^\circ$, that for the mZK soliton goes to zero as $\alpha\rightarrow 90^\circ$. However, depending on the angle $\alpha$, the growth rates are found to be reduced either by increasing the values of $\beta_{\rm{cl}}$ or by decreasing the values of $r_{d0}$. The applications of our results to astrophysical plasmas, such as those in the environments of white dwarfs are discussed.

# Coriolis Forces Modify Magnetostatic Ponderomotive Potentials

## 科里奥利力改变静磁动力势

arXiv:2408.08434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is possible to produce a ponderomotive effect in a plasma system without time-varying fields, if the plasma flows over spatial oscillations in the field. This can be achieved by superimposing a spatially oscillatory perturbation on a guide field, then setting up an electric field perpendicular to the guide field to drive flow over the perturbation. However, subtle distinctions in the structure of the resulting electric field can entirely change the behavior of the resulting ponderomotive force. Previous work has shown that, in slab models, these distinctions can be explained in terms of the polarization of the effective wave that appears in the co-moving frame. Here we consider what happens to this picture in a cylindrical system, where the transformation to the co-moving (rotating) frame is not inertial. It turns out that the non-inertial nature of this frame transformation can lead to counterintuitive behavior, partly due to the appearance of parallel (magnetic-field-aligned) electric fields in the rotating frame even in cases where none existed in the laboratory frame. Apart from the academic interest of this study, the practical impact lies in being better able to anticipate the antenna configuration on the plasma periphery of a cylindrical plasma that will lead to optimal ponderomotive barrier formation in the interior plasma.

# Reconfigurable Manipulation of Sound with a Multi-material 3D-Printed Origami Metasurface

Abstract: The challenge in reconfigurable manipulation of sound waves using metasurfaces lies in achieving precise control over acoustic behavior while developing efficient and practical tuning methods for structural configurations. However, most studies on reconfigurable acoustic metasurfaces rely on cumbersome and time-consuming control systems. These approaches often struggle with fabrication techniques, as conventional methods face limitations such as restricted material choices, challenges in achieving complex geometries, and difficulties in incorporating flexible components. This paper proposes a novel approach for developing a reconfigurable metasurface inspired by the Kresling origami pattern, designed for programmable manipulation of acoustic waves at an operating frequency of 2000 Hz. The origami unit cell is fabricated using multi-material 3D printing technology, allowing for the simultaneous printing of two materials with different mechanical properties, thus creating a bistable origami-based structure. Through optimization, two equilibrium states achieve a reflection phase difference of {\pi} through the application of small axial force, F, or torque, T. Various configurations of the metasurface, generated from different combinations of these two equilibria, enable distinct reflective behaviors with switchable and programmable functionalities. The principle of this work simplifies the shaping of acoustic waves through a straightforward mechanical mechanism, eliminating the need for complex control systems and time-consuming adjustments. This innovative approach paves a novel and effective perspective for developing on-demand switchable and tunable devices across diverse fields, including electromagnetics, mechanics, and elastics, leveraging multi-material printing technology.

# A pedagogical tour of the Fourier transform with applications to NMR and IR spectroscopy

Abstract: The Fourier Transform (FT) is a fundamental tool that permeates modern science and technology. While chemistry undergraduates encounter the FT as early as second year, their courses often only mention it in passing because computers frequently perform it automatically behind the scenes. Although this automation enables students to focus on `the chemistry', students miss out on an opportunity to understand and use one of the most powerful tools in the scientific arsenal capable of revealing how time-dependent signals encode chemical structure. Although many educational resources introduce chemists to the FT, they often require familiarity with sophisticated mathematical and computational concepts. Here, we present a series of three self-contained, Python-based laboratory activities for undergraduates to understand the FT and apply it to analyze audio signals, an infrared (IR) spectroscopy interferogram, and a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) free induction decay (FID). In these activities, students observe how the FT reveals and quantifies the contribution of each frequency present in a temporal signal and how decay timescales dictate signal broadening. Our activities empower students with the tools to transform their own temporal datasets (e.g., FID) to a frequency spectrum. To ensure accessibility of the activities and lower the barrier to implementation, we utilize Google Colab's open-source, cloud-based platform to run Jupyter notebooks. We also offer a pre-laboratory activity that introduces students to the basics of Python and the Colab platform, and reviews the math and programming skills needed to complete the lab activities. These lab activities help students build a qualitative, quantitative, and practical understanding of the FT.

# Photospheric Hot Spots at Solar Coronal Loop Footpoints Revealed by Hyperspectral Imaging Observations

## 高光谱成像观测揭示的太阳日冕环脚点的光球热点

arXiv:2410.04964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here we report high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.1\arcsec) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar H$\alpha$ line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as H$\alpha$ wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of $\sim$0.2\arcsec, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the H$\alpha$ wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the H$\alpha$ line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The H$\alpha$ wing integrated Stokes $V/I$ maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger than the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs. Therefore, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.

# Achieving controllable distribution of metal cations (Pd, Pt, Ni, Cr, Cu) in a zeolite either as [M(II)-OH]/1Al or M(II)/2Al provides novel mechanistic insights for adsorptive and catalytic reactions

## 实现金属阳离子 (Pd，Pt，Ni，Cr，Cu) 在沸石中作为 [M(II)-OH]/1Al或M(II)/2Al的可控分布为吸附和催化反应提供了新颖的机理见解

Directing divalent metals to form either M(II) or M(II)-OH cationic species on the same support could provide an opportunity to compare their reactivity, if successful. Utilizing H-BEA zeolites with similar Si/Al ratios but with differing framework Al siting, we anchored multiple divalent metal cations (Ni, Pd, Pt, Cr, Cu) in the zeolite micropores. State-of-the-art infrared (IR) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements, including 2-dimensional pulsed HYSCORE EPR, EXAFS, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide unambiguous evidence for the selective formation of divalent metal cations as M+2/2Al species (for conventional zeolite prepared in the hydroxide media), and [M(II)-OH]+1/1Al species for H-BEA prepared in HF. This allowed us to explore their reactivities in the most important catalytic and adsorptive applications, which was not previously possible both in organometallic homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis: we provide evidence for their divergent reactivity in ethylene dimerization, ethylene oxidation (Wacker process), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO, NO adsorption, and methane oxidation. M+2/2Al and [M(II)-OH]+1/1Al species are both active for ethylene dimerization (including the first example of Pt/Zeolite reactivity for ethylene oligomerization), with [M(II)-OH]+1/1Al being more active in all cases (Pd, Ni, Pt). [M(II)-OH]+1/1Al is active for acetaldehyde formation in Wacker ethylene oxidation.   We also propose the existence of a new active site with a terminal OH group (Cr-OH) in Phillips catalysts for ethylene oligomerization, as isolated Cr in BEA zeolite is virtually inactive, whereas Cr-OH shows activity in ethylene dimerization

# Three-dimensional evaluation of articular disc position and other temporomandibular joint morphology among Chinese patients with temporomandibular disorders: A retrospective MRI study

## 中国颞下颌关节紊乱病患者关节盘位置及其他颞下颌关节形态的三维评估: 一项回顾性MRI研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5327858/latest

Background The etiology and pathophysiology of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), particularly the internal derangement of the joint, remain unclear. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the discal space changes, condylar position, and distance of disc displacement that occur in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and to explore joint space dimensions correlation to other factors such as age, sex, and distance of disc displacement.Methods A total of 130 patients (260 joints) were included in this cross-sectional study. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of each patient was used to evaluate the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discal space dimensions in the coronal and sagittal sections, and the distance of disc displacement. One-way ANOVA and Independent sample t-test were used for the normally distributed variables, and Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney u test were used for non-normally distributed variables. Bivariate correlation was conducted using spearman correlation coefficients to investigate the relation between age, disc position, and joint space dimensions.Results Among the sagittal spaces, the central joint space (CJS) was significantly larger on both sides (p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001). When comparing joint spaces among sexes, the right side anterior joint space (AJS) was significantly greater in females (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.006), while the left side medial and lateral joint spaces (MJS and LJS) were greater in males (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.037 and 0.026, respectively). Discal space dimensions showed to be narrower in patients younger than 25 years, particularly for the central and medial discal spaces (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001). The results of the bivariate analysis revealed a significant moderate to weak positive correlation between the age, AJS, CJS, and MJS in anterior disc displacement with reduction ADDWR (&amp;#119903;-2. = 0.408, 0.537, 0,287, respectively). Likewise, correlation between age and MJS showed weak correlation in anterior disc displacement without reduction ADDWoR (&amp;#119903;-2. = -0.253).Conclusion The central joint space is the largest among the other spaces. There are significant differences in joint space dimensions between sexes and age groups. Females have larger anterior joint spaces, whereas males present larger medial and lateral joint spaces. Additionally, younger individuals present narrower discal spaces, with age correlating moderately to weakly with joint space dimensions in cases of anterior disc displacement.

# Preparation of drug carrier material with targeted and sustained-release from modified lignin

## 改性木质素制备靶向缓释药物载体材料

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5148496/latest

In this paper, modified lignin drug carrier materials with targeted and sustained-release effect were studied and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FIRS), hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR), UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Zeta potential. In vitro drug release, toxicity, drug distribution and anticancer effect were tested. The results showed that the solubility of lacerated lignin in alcohol solution was 1.14 times than alkali lignin. The modified acetyl group replaced the free phenol hydroxide group in the benzene ring of lignin, and the structure of lignin itself did not change. The lignin-coated material was hollow small-hole ionospheres, and the drug loading rate and encapsulation rate of facilitate reached 17.8% and 71.23% respectively. Facilitate release rate was only 21.94% when pH value of human gastric juice was 1.2. The release rate of facilitate could reach 74.81% at pH 5.5 of simulated tumor cells. The drug release behavior was obvious within 10 h. When the concentration of lignin carrier material was 10&amp;ndash;100 mg/ml, the survival rate of cells was greater than 95%, indicating that lignin coated material was non-toxic and had stable slow-release and targeting effect. In addition, the biological distribution of facilitate in mice showed that PTX was mainly concentrated in tumor sites of mice, but in liver, spleen, lung and kidney was low. In the anti-cancer effect test, the tumor cells were significantly reduced after 5 consecutive administration, which also proved that the lignin/PTX drug delivery system has high targeting and anti-cancer effect.
