# Frustrated Spin Systems: History of the Emergence of a Modern Physics

## 失意的自旋系统: 现代物理学出现的历史

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12826

arXiv:2411.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1977, G\'erard Toulouse has proposed a new concept termed as "frustration" in spin systems. Using this definition, several frustrated models have been created and studied, among them we can mention the Villain's model, the fully frustrated simple cubic lattice, the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice. The former models are systems with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, while in the latter containing only an antiferromagnetic interaction, the frustration is caused by the lattice geometry. These frustrated spin systems have novel properties that we will review in this paper. One of the striking aspects is the fact that well-established methods such as the renormalization group fail to deal with the nature of the phase transition in frustrated systems. Investigations of properties of frustrated spin systems have been intensive since the 80's. I myself got involved in several investigations of frustrated spin systems soon after my PhD. I have learned a lot from numerous discussions with G\'erard Toulouse. Until today, I am still working on frustrated systems such as skyrmions. In this review, I trace back a number of my works over the years on frustrated spin systems going from exactly solved 2D Ising frustrated models, to XY and Heisenberg 2D and 3D frustrated lattices. At the end I present my latest results on skyrmions resulting from the frustration caused by the competition between the exchange interaction and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction under an applied magnetic field. A quantum spin-wave theory using the Green's function method is shown and discussed.

arXiv:2411.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the spin contributions to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) in transition metals. The IFE is primarily driven by spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced asymmetry between excited electron and hole spin moments. Our results reveal that even elements with smaller electron magnetic moments, like Os, can exhibit higher IFE due to greater electron-hole asymmetry. Pt shows the highest IFE in the 1 - 2 eV frequency range, while Os dominates in the 2 - 4 eV range. In addition, we demonstrate that the IFE of neighboring elements with similar crystal structures (e.g., Ir, Pt, and Au) can be tuned by adjusting their Fermi levels, indicating the importance of d electron filling on IFE. Finally, we find that the trend in electron (or hole) contributions to the IFE closely follows that of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC), however, the total IFE involves more complex interactions.

# Magnetoelastic Interactions Reduce Hysteresis in Soft Magnets

## 磁弹性相互作用可减少软磁体的磁滞

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12875

arXiv:2411.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The width of the magnetic hysteresis loop is often correlated with the material's magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant $\kappa_1$. Traditionally, a common approach to reduce the hysteresis width has been to develop alloys with $\kappa_1$ as close to zero as possible. However, contrary to this widely accepted view, we present evidence that magnetoelastic interactions governed by magnetostriction constants, elastic stiffness, and applied stresses play an important role in reducing magnetic hysteresis width, despite large $\kappa_1$ values. We use a nonlinear micromagnetics framework to systematically investigate the interplay between material constants $\lambda_{100}$, $c_{11}$, $c_{12}$, $\kappa_1$, applied or residual stresses $\sigma_{\mathrm{R}}$, and needle domains to collectively lower the energy barrier for magnetization reversal. A distinguishing feature of our work is that we correlate the energy barrier governing the growth of needle domains with the width of the hysteresis loop. This energy barrier approach enables us to capture the nuanced interplay between anisotropy constant, magnetostriction, and applied stresses, and their combined influence on magnetic hysteresis. We propose a mathematical relationship on the coercivity map: $\kappa_1 = \alpha(c_{11}-c_{12})(\lambda_{100}+\beta\sigma_{11})^2$ for which magnetic hysteresis can be minimized for a uniaxial residual stress $\sigma_\mathrm{R} = \sigma_{11}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1\otimes\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1$ (and for some constants $\alpha$, $\beta$). These results serve as quantitative guidelines to design magnetic alloys with small hysteresis, and potentially guide the discovery of a new generation of soft magnets located beyond the $\kappa_1 \to 0$ region.

# Investigation of magnetic excitations and charge order in a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$

## 范德华铁磁体Fe $_5 $ GeTe $_2 $ 中的磁激发和电荷顺序的研究

arXiv:2411.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex ground state of van der Waals (vdW) magnets is essential for designing new materials and devices that leverage these platforms. Here, we investigate a two-dimensional vdW ferromagnet -- Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$-- with one of the highest reported Curie temperatures, to elucidate its magnetic excitations and charge order. Using Fe $L_3 - $edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we find the dual character of magnetic excitations, consisting of a coherent magnon and a continuum, similar to what is reported for its sister compound Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The magnon has an energy of $\approx$ 36 meV at the maximum in-plane momentum transfer ($-$0.35 r.l.u.) allowed at Fe $L_3 - $edge. A broad and non-dispersive continuum extends up to 150 meV, 50$\%$ higher energy than in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. Its intensity is sinusoidally modulated along the $L$ direction, with a period matching the inter-slab distance. Our findings suggest that while the unconventional dual character of magnetic excitations is generic to ternary Fe-Ge-Te vdW magnets, the correlation length of the out-of-plane magnetic interaction increases in Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ as compared to Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, supporting a stronger three-dimensional character for the former. Furthermore, by investigating the $\pm$(1/3, 1/3, $L$) peaks by resonant x-ray diffraction, we conclude these to have structural origin rather than charge order -- as previously reported -- and suggest doubling of the structural unit cell along the $c-$axis.

Abstract: We present photo-electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and first-principles calculations that indicate germanium (Ge) is a DX-center in AlGaN. Our photo-EPR measurements on Ge-doped AlGaN samples show no EPR spectra in the dark, while persistent EPR spectra is observed upon photoexcitation with photon energies greater than ~1.3 eV. Thermally annealing the samples decreased the EPR signal, with the critical temperature to quench the EPR signal being larger in the lower Al-content sample. Using detailed first-principles calculations of Ge in AlGaN, we show all of these observations can be explained by accounting for the DX configuration of Ge in AlGaN.

# Conic sections in ferroelectric nematics: experiments and mathematical modeling

## 铁电向列中的圆锥截面: 实验和数学建模

arXiv:2411.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain structure of a fluid ferroelectric nematic is dramatically different from the domain structure of solid ferroelectrics since it is not restricted by rectilinear crystallographic axes and planar surface facets. We demonstrate that thin films of a ferroelectric nematic seeded by colloidal inclusions produce domain walls in the shape of conics such as a parabola. These conics reduce the bound charge within the domains and at the domain walls. An adequate description of the domain structures requires one to analyze the electrostatic energy, which is a challenging task. Instead, we demonstrate that a good approximation to the experimentally observed polydomain textures is obtained when the divergence of spontaneous polarization - which causes the bound charge is heavily penalized by assuming that the elastic constant of splay in the Oseen-Frank energy is much larger than those for twist and bend. The model takes advantage of the fact that the polarization vector is essentially parallel to the nematic director throughout the sample.

# Magnetic-thermodynamic phase transition in strained phosphorous-doped graphene

## 应变磷掺杂石墨烯的磁-热力学相变

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12959

arXiv:2411.12959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore quantum-thermodynamic effects in a phosphorous (P)-doped graphene monolayer subjected to biaxial tensile strain. Introducing substitutional P atoms in the graphene lattice generates a tunable spin magnetic moment controlled by the strain control parameter $\varepsilon$. This leads to a magnetic quantum phase transition (MQPT) at zero temperature modulated by $\varepsilon$. The system transitions from a magnetic phase, characterized by an out-of-plane $sp^3$ type hybridization of the P-carbon (P-C) bonds, to a non-magnetic phase when these bonds switch to in-plane $sp^2$ hybridization. Employing a Fermi-Dirac statistical model, we calculate key thermodynamic quantities as the electronic entropy $S_e$ and electronic specific heat $C_e$. At finite temperatures, we find the MQPT is reflected in both $S_e$ and $C_e$, which display a distinctive $\Lambda$-shaped profile as a function of $\varepsilon$. These thermodynamic quantities sharply increase up to $\varepsilon = 5\% $ in the magnetic regime, followed by a sudden drop at $\varepsilon = 5.5\% $, transitioning to a linear dependence on $\varepsilon$ in the nonmagnetic regime. Notably, $S_e$ and $C_e$ capture the MQPT behavior for low and moderate temperature ranges, providing insights into the accessible electronic states in P-doped graphene. This controllable magnetic-to-nonmagnetic switch offers potential applications in electronic nanodevices operating at finite temperatures.

# RC circuit based on magnetic skyrmions

## 基于磁skyrmim的RC电路

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13061

arXiv:2411.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions are nano-sized magnetic whirls attractive for spintronic applications due to their innate stability. They can emulate the characteristic behavior of various spintronic and electronic devices such as spin-torque nano-oscillators, artificial neurons and synapses, logic devices, diodes, and ratchets. Here, we show that skyrmions can emulate the physics of an RC circuit, the fundamental electric circuit composed of a resistor and a capacitor, on the nanosecond time scale. The equation of motion of a current-driven skyrmion in a quadratic energy landscape is mathematically equivalent to the differential equation characterizing an RC circuit: the applied current resembles the applied input voltage, and the skyrmion position resembles the output voltage at the capacitor. These predictions are confirmed via micromagnetic simulations. We show that such a skyrmion system reproduces the characteristic exponential voltage decay upon charging and discharging the capacitor under constant input. Furthermore, it mimics the low-pass filter behavior of RC circuits by filtering high-frequencies in periodic input signals. Since RC circuits are mathematically equivalent to the Leaky-Integrate-Fire (LIF) model widely used to describe biological neurons, our device concept can also be regarded as a perfect artificial LIF neuron.

The magnetic and specific heat measurements reveal the effective-1/2 spins are Ising-like. The persistent spin dynamics is determined down to 37~mK. Our study present a remarkable example of Ising spins on the triangular lattice, which remains magnetically disordered at low temperatures and potentially hosts a quantum spin liquid ground state.

arXiv:2411.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied daisy-chained extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) devices based on high quality monolayer graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) at room temperature. The largest magnetoresistance (MR) achieved in our devices is 4.6 x 10^7 %, the record for EMR devices to date. The magnetic field sensitivity, dR/dB, reaches 104 kohm/T, exceeding the previous record set by encapsulated graphene by more than 300 %, and is comparable with state-of-the-art graphene Hall sensors at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K). We demonstrate that daisy chaining multiple EMR devices is a new way to reach arbitrarily high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, and extremely small noise equivalent field for weak magnetic field detection. Finally, we show the evidence of metal contact-induced Fermi-level pinning in the sample and its influence on graphene properties, current distribution and EMR performance. We highlight the EMR geometry as an interesting alternative to the Hall geometry for fundamental physics studies.

Abstract: Using radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy, we measure the $p$-wave contacts in a Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance. The RF spectrum exhibits clear asymptotic behavior, characterized by $\tilde{\omega}^{-1/2}$ and $\tilde{\omega}^{-3/2}$ dependencies. The magnetic-field dependence of the $p$-wave contacts agrees reasonably well with the virial expansion theory in a detuned magnetic field range, validating the theory near the Fermi temperature. The $p$-wave contacts measured in this study constitute a second dataset, complementing the data obtained from the $^{40}$K system and contributing valuable insights into $p$-wave interactions in ultracold Fermi gases.

arXiv:2411.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.

arXiv:2411.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed Monte Carlo simulations for the investigation of dynamic phase transitions on a honeycomb lattice which has garnered a significant amount of interest from the viewpoint of tailoring the intrinsic magnetism in two-dimensional materials. For the system under the influence of time-dependent magnetic field sequences exhibiting the half-wave anti-symmetry, we have located a second order dynamic phase transition between dynamic ferromagnetic and dynamic paramagnetic states. Particular emphasis was devoted for the examination of the generalized conjugate field formalism previously introduced in the kinetic Ising model [\color{blue}Quintana and Berger, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{104}, 044125 (202); Phys. Rev. E \textbf{109}, 054112] \color{black}. Based on the simulation data, in the presence of a second magnetic field component with amplitude $H_{2}$ and period $P/2$, the half-wave anti-symmetry is broken and the generalized conjugate field formalism is found to be valid for the present system. However, dynamic scaling exponent significantly deviates from its equilibrium value along with the manifestation of a dynamically field polarized state for non-vanishing $H_{2}$ values.

Abstract: We model a spin-phase transition in a two-dimensional square array, or a lateral superlattice, of quantum rings in an external perpendicular homogeneous magnetic field. The electron system is placed in a circular cylindrical far-infrared photon cavity with a single circularly symmetric photon mode. Our numerical results reveal that the spin ordering of the two-dimensional electron gas in each quantum ring can be influenced or controlled by the electron-photon coupling strength and the energy of the photons. The Coulomb interaction between the electrons is described by a spin-density functional approach, but the para- and the diamagnetic electron-photon interactions are modeled via a configuration interaction formalism in a truncated many-body Fock-space, which is updated in each iteration step of the density functional approach. In the absence of external electromagnetic pulses this spin-phase transition is replicated in the orbital magnetization of the rings. The spin-phase transition can be suppressed by a strong electron-photon interaction. In addition, fluctuations in the spin configuration are found in dynamical calculations, where the system is excited by a time-dependent scheme specially fit for emphasizing the diamagnetic electron-photon interaction.

Abstract: Altermagnetism, as a new branch of magnetism independent of traditional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, has attracted extensive attention recently. At present, researchers have proved several kinds of three-dimensional altermagnets, but research on two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets remains elusive. Here, we propose a method for designing altermagnetism in 2D lattices: bilayer reversed stacking. This method could enable altermagnetism-type spin splitting to occur intrinsically and the spin-splitting can be controlled by crystal chirality. We also demonstrate it through a real material of bilayer PtBr$_3$ with AB' stacking order. Additionally, the combination of stacking order and slidetronics offers new opportunities for electrical writing and magnetic reading of electronic devices. In the case of AC' stacking, interlayer sliding results in reversible spontaneous polarization. This unique combination of antiferromagnetism and sliding ferroelectricity leads to polarization-controlled spin-splitting, thus enabling magnetoelectric coupling, which can be detected by magneto-optical Kerr effect even without net magnetization. Our research highlights that reversed stacking provides a platform to explore rich physical properties of magnetism, ferroelectricity, and spin-splitting.

# Quantum Micromagnetic Theory of Magnons in Finite Nanostructures

## 有限纳米结构中磁振子的量子微磁学理论

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13236

arXiv:2411.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum field theoretical formalism for studying magnons in finite nanostructures with arbitrary shapes and spatially nonuniform ground states. It extends the classical micromagnetic formalism by introducing a micromagnetic Hamiltonian quantum operator, which incorporates exchange, Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya, anisotropy, magnetostatic, and Zeeman energies. The nonuniformity of the ground state is handled by pointwise aligning the quantization axis of the magnetization field operator with the classical ground state. The Hamiltonian is expanded in the large spin-number limit and truncated to retain only terms quadratic in the components of the magnetization operator transverse to the quantization axis. This quadratic Hamiltonian is used to derive the linear quantum Landau-Lifshitz equation. By diagonalizing this equation under appropriate boundary and normalization conditions, a discrete set of magnon creation and annihilation operators is obtained, enabling a complete description of the magnon spectrum. Finally, the theory is applied to study the effects of temperature and shape on low-temperature thermal equilibrium fluctuations of magnons in thin ferromagnetic nanodisks.

Abstract: While the conducting CuO$_2$ planes in cuprate superconductors have been widely recognized as a crucial component in producing high superconducting $T_\text{c}$, recent experimental and theoretical studies on Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{3+}$$_\delta$ have also drawn much attention to the importance of Cu-O chains in one-dimensional (1D) cuprates. To better understand the cuprates containing Cu-O chains, here we have studied the electronic, magnetic, and phonon properties of Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ bulk and films based on the spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. We first reproduced the typical Mott insulator feature of the cuprate parent compound for bulk Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, and then built a Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ thin film with Cu-O chains exposed on the surface to directly investigate their characteristics. Different from the insulating bulk phase, the Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ surface shows interesting metallic properties. Further electronic structure calculations reveal the existence of spin-polarized electron gas between surface Sr atoms that strongly depends on the interchain coupling of Cu spins. Moreover, the phonon modes that involve the vibrations of in-chain and out-of-chain O atoms can induce strong charge and spin fluctuations in the surface layer of Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ film, which suggests significant multiple degree-of-freedom couplings that may be important for the superconductivity in 1D cuprates. Our work provides a comprehensive viewpoint of the properties of Cu-O chains in Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, facilitating a complete understanding of 1D cuprate superconductors.

# Adiabatic Spin and Orbital Pumping in Metallic Heterostructures

arXiv:2411.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the spin and orbital densities induced by magnetization dynamics in a planar bilayer heterostructure. To do this, we employed a theory of adiabatic pumping using the Keldysh formalism and Wigner expansion. We first conduct simulations on a model system to determine the parameters that control the spin and orbital pumping into an adjacent non-magnetic metal. We conclude that, in principle, the orbital pumping can be as significant as spin pumping when the spin-orbit coupling is present in the ferromagnet. We extend the study to realistic heterostructures involving heavy metals (W, Pt, Au) and light metals (Ti, Cu) by using first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that orbital pumping is favored in metals with $d$ states close to the Fermi level, such as Ti, Pt, and W, but is quenched in materials lacking such states, such as Cu and Au. Orbital injection is also favored in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, leading to large orbital pumping in Ni/(Pt, W) bilayers.

Abstract: The recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ with $T_c \approx 80K$ provides another intriguing platform to explore the microscopic mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we study a previously proposed bi-layer two-orbital model Hamiltonian for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ [Y. Shen, et al, Chinese Physics Letters 40, 127401 (2023)] on a plaquette ladder, which is a minimum setup with two-dimensional characteristic. We employ large-scale Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations to accurately determine the ground state of the model. We determine the density, magnetic structure, and the pairing property of the model. We find that with large effective inter-layer anti-ferromagnetic exchange for the 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, both spin, charge, and pairing correlation display quasi-long-range behavior, which could be viewed as a precursor of possible true long-range order in the two dimensional limit. Interestingly, sign oscillation for the pairing correlation are observed for both the 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and 3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, indicating the presence of possible pair density wave in the system. Even though we only study the model on a quasi one-dimensional plaquette ladder geometry due to the computational difficulty, the results on the spin, charge, and pairing correlation provide valuable insight in the clarification of the properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ in the future.

# Wavenumber-dependent magnetic losses in YIG-GGG heterostructures at millikelvin temperatures

Abstract: Magnons have inspired potential applications in modern quantum technologies and hybrid quantum systems due to their intrinsic nonlinearity, nanoscale scalability, and a unique set of experimentally accessible parameters for manipulating their dispersion. Such magnon-based quantum technologies demand long decoherence times, millikelvin temperatures, and minimal dissipation. Due to its low magnetic damping, the ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet (YIG), grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), is the most promising material for this objective. To comprehend the magnetic losses of propagating magnons in such YIG-GGG heterostructures at cryogenic temperatures, we investigate magnon transport in a micrometer-thick YIG sample via propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (PSWS) measurements for temperatures between 4K to 26mK. We demonstrate an increase in the dissipation rate with wavenumber at cryogenic temperatures, caused by dipolar coupling to the partially magnetized GGG substrate. Additionally, we observe a temperature-dependent decrease in spin-wave transmission, attributed to rare earth ion relaxations. The critical role of the additional dissipation channels at cryogenic temperatures is underpinned by the comparison of the experimental results with theoretical calculations and micromagnetic simulations. Our findings strengthen the understanding of magnon losses at millikelvin temperatures, which is essential for the future detection of individual propagating magnons.

## 相关反铁磁体物理学中的非扰动壮举

arXiv:2411.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decades multifaceted manifestations of the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation theory have been identified for the many-electron problem. Yet, the investigations have been so far mostly limited to paramagnetic states, where symmetry breaking is not allowed. Here, we extend the analysis to the spontaneously symmetry-broken antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of the repulsive Hubbard model. To this aim, we calculated two-particle quantities using dynamical mean-field theory for the AF-ordered Hubbard model and studied the possible occurrence of divergences of the irreducible vertex functions in the charge and spin sectors. Our calculations pinpoint the divergences in the AF phase diagram, showing that while the onset of AF order mitigates the breakdown of the perturbation expansion, it does not fully prevent it. Moreover, we have been able to link the changes in the dynamical structure of the corresponding generalized susceptibilities to the physical crossover from a weak-coupling (Slater) to a strong-coupling (Heisenberg) antiferromagnet, which takes place as the interaction strength is gradually increased. Finally, we discuss possible physical consequences of the irreducible vertex divergences in triggering phase-separation instabilities within the AF phase and elaborate on the implications of our findings for two-dimensional systems, where the onset of a long-range AF order is prevented by the Mermin-Wagner theorem.

# Thermal Entropy, Density Disorder and Antiferromagnetism of Repulsive Fermions in 3D Optical Lattice

Abstract: The celebrated antiferromagnetic phase transition was realized in a most recent optical lattice experiment for 3D fermionic Hubbard model [Shao {\it et al}., Nature {\bf 632}, 267 (2024)]. Despite the great achievement, it was observed that the AFM structure factor (and also the critical entropy) reaches the maximum around the interaction strength $U/t\simeq 11.75$, which is significantly larger than the theoretical prediction as $U/t\simeq 8$. Here we resolve this discrepancy by studying the interplay between the thermal entropy, density disorder and antiferromagnetism of half-filled 3D Hubbard model with numerically exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We have achieved accurate entropy phase diagram, which allows us to simulate arbitrary entropy path on the temperature-interaction plane and to track the experimental parameters. We then find that above discrepancy can be quantitatively explained by the {\it entropy increase} as enhancing the interaction in experiment, and together by the lattice {\it density disorder} existing in the experimental setup. We furthermore investigate the entropy dependence of double occupancy, and predict its universal behaviors which can be used as useful probes in future optical lattice experiments.

arXiv:2411.12362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opening or closing mechanism of a voltage-gated ion channel is triggered by the potential difference crossing the cell membrane in the nervous system. Based on this picture, we model the ion channel as a nanoscale two-terminal ionic tunneling junction. External time-varying voltage exerting on the two-terminal ionic tunneling junction mimics the stimulation of neurons from the outside. By deriving the quantum Langevin equation from quantum mechanics, the ion channel current is obtained by the quantum tunneling of ions controlled by the time-varying voltage. The time-varying voltage induces an effective magnetic flux which causes quantum coherence in ion tunnelings and leads to sideband effects in the ion channel current dynamics. The sideband effects in the ionic current dynamics manifest a multi-crossing hysteresis in the I-V curve, which is the memory dynamics responding to the variation of the external voltage. Such memory dynamics is defined as the active quantum memory with respect to the time-varying stimuli. We can quantitatively describe how active quantum memory is generated and changed. We find that the number of the non-zero cross points in the I-V curve hysteresis and the oscillation of the differential conductance are the characteristics for quantitatively describing the active quantum memory. We also explore the temperature dependence of the active quantum memory in such a system. The discovery of this active quantum memory characteristics provides a new understanding about the underlying mechanism of ion channel dynamics.

Abstract: We theoretically and numerically elucidate the electrical control over spin waves in antiferromagnetic materials (AFM) with biaxial anisotropies and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The spin wave dispersion in an AFM manifests as a bifurcated spectrum with distinct high-frequency and low-frequency bands. Utilizing a heterostructure comprised of platinum and the AFM, we demonstrate anisotropic control of spin-wave bands via spin currents with three-dimensional spin polarizations, encompassing both resonant and propagating wave modes. Moreover, leveraging the confined geometry, we explore the possibility of controlling spin waves within a spectral domain ranging from tens of gigahertz to sub-terahertz frequencies. The implications of our findings suggest the potential for developing a terahertz wave source with electrical tunability, thereby facilitating its incorporation into ultrafast, broadband, and wireless communication technologies.

Abstract: Heterostructures composed of the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and its non-magnetic counterpart Bi$_2$Te$_3$ host distinct surface electronic band structures depending on the stacking order and exposed termination. Here, we probe the ultrafast dynamical response of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ following near-infrared optical excitation using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and disentangle surface from bulk dynamics based on density functional theory slab calculations of the surface-projected electronic structure. We gain access to the out-of-equilibrium charge carrier populations of both MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface terminations of MnBi$_4$Te$_7$, revealing an instantaneous occupation of states associated with the Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface layer followed by carrier extraction into the adjacent MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ layers with a laser fluence-tunable delay of up to 350 fs. The ensuing thermal relaxation processes are driven by phonon scattering with significantly slower relaxation times in the magnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ septuple layers. The observed competition between interlayer charge transfer and intralayer phonon scattering demonstrates a method to control ultrafast charge transfer processes in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-based van der Waals compounds.

Abstract: Using Raman scattering spectroscopy, we uncover a complex magnetic behavior of Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ , which stands out among magnetic pyrochlores by the lowest temperature of the all-in-all-out (AIAO) Ir moments ordering ($T^\mathrm{N}_{\small\rm{Ir}}=33$~K) and the highest temperature at which AIAO order of rare-earth Nd ions is detected ($T^\mathrm{*}_{\small\rm{Nd}}$=15~K). Our findings suggest that in the temperature range between 15~K and 33~K, Nd magnetic moments exhibit strong fluctuations, possibly originating from spin ice behavior. This complex behavior emerges from the interplay of strong spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations, and geometric frustration on two magnetic pyrochlore sublattices of Nd and Ir ions. The ordering of Ir magnetic moments is accompanied by an appearance of one-magnon Raman modes at 26.3 and 29.6 meV compatible with the AIAO order and of a broad mode at 14 meV, which could be associated with spinon continuum arising from Nd spin ice fluctuations. While two one-magnon excitations show minimal temperature evolution with decreasing temperature, the 14 meV mode shifts to higher frequencies as the temperature approaches a crossover to Nd AIAO order, broadens, and disappears below 15~K. An additional two-magnon excitation of the AIAO Nd order at around 33 meV appears in the spectra at low temperatures. These rather high energies of magnetic excitations of Nd moments make Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ a particularly attractive playground to study the rare-earth magnetism on the pyrochlore lattice.

Abstract: Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) has a crucial feature for developing highly sensitive sensors and innovative memory devices. While extensively studied in bulk materials, AMR effects in these materials are typically weak. Recent advancements indicate that two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnetic materials possess unique magnetic properties, potentially including significant AMR characteristics. In this study, we utilize density functional theory and the Boltzmann transport equation to investigate AMR in magnetic monolayers CrPX3 (X = S, Se, Te). Our findings reveal a substantially large AMR in these 2D magnetic compounds. This enhancement is attributed to magnetization (M)-dependent spin-orbit coupling (SOC), arising from the broken symmetry between in-plane and out-of-plane orientations. This results in significant M-dependent band splitting and subsequent variations in electron velocity. Additionally, we find that the M-dependent SOC is significantly enhanced by increasing the atomic number of the chalcogen X in CrPX3, achieving an exceptional 150% AMR in CrPTe3. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that AMR can be effectively modulated by applying biaxial strain, resulting in a twofold increase with a 4% strain. These findings propose a novel approach to enhancing 2D-based AMR spintronic devices, making a substantial contribution to the field.

Abstract: In this article, we propose a new concept of bilayer stacking A-type altermagnet (BSAA), in which two identical ferromagnetic monolayers are stacked with antiferromagnetic coupling to form a two-dimensional A-type altermagnet. By solving the stacking model, we derive all BSAAs for all layer groups and draw three key conclusions: (1) Only 17 layer groups can realize intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. All 2D A-type altermagnets must belong to these 17 layer groups, which will be helpful to search for 2D A-type altermagnet. (2) It is impossible to connect the two sublattices of BSAA using $S_{3z}$ or $S_{6z}$, a constraint that is also applicable to all 2D altermagnets. (3) $C_{2\alpha}$ is a general stacking operation to generate BSAA for an arbitrary monolayer. Our theory not only can explain the previously reported twisted-bilayer altermagnets, but also can provide more possibilities to generate A-type altermagnets. Our research has significantly broadened the range of candidate materials for 2D altermagnets. Based on conclusion (1), the bilayer NiZrCl$_6$ is predicted to exhibit intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. Additionally, we use twisted-bilayer NiCl$_2$, previously reported in the literature, as the second example of BSAA. Furthermore, utilizing symmetry analysis and first-principles calculation, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristic to substantiate their altermagnetic properties.

arXiv:2408.00841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments on altermagnetism, we investigate the Hubbard model on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice, where the onsite repulsion between electrons induces the onset of a staggered magnetic order in which opposite magnetic sublattices are related to each other only by rotations and glide reflections, and not by inversion nor translations. As a consequence, the magnetic phase displays an altermagnetic character, i.e. a finite (non-relativistic) Zeeman splitting of the electronic excitations, despite the absence of a net magnetization. By means of a variational Monte Carlo approach based on Jastrow-Slater wave functions, which accounts for electronic correlations beyond the single-particle approximation, we study how $d$-wave altermagnetism shows up in the ground state properties and in the spectral function of the system. We characterize the metal-insulator transition between altermagnetic phases at half-filling and the stability of altermagnetism as a function of doping. The calculation of the single-particle spectral function displays the spin-split nature of the electronic excitations, also within the Mott insulating regime. We discuss possible realizations of the model in the context of organic $\alpha$- or $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X charge transfer salts.

Abstract: Magnetoelectric materials displaying strong magnetically induced polarization have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and various fast electrically controlled magnetic devices. CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ (CMO) stands out for its giant spin-induced ferroelectric polarization. However, the origin of the induced electric polarization in CMO remains highly controversial and continues to be a subject of ongoing debate. In this paper, through room temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and thermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) measurements, we provide experimental evidence for a route to tune the magnetically induced polarization by modifying the exchange-striction in CMO via Sr-doping. Our findings demonstrate that the large and broad current peaks observed near the first magnetic phase transition ($T_N1 \sim 90$ K) indicate polarization contributions from both thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) and intrinsic magnetically induced electric polarization. We suggest that this reduction in induced electric polarization in CMO originates from the increase in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- O -- Mn$^{4+}$ bond angle due to Sr$^{2+}$ doping, weakening the exchange-striction interaction. Meanwhile, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) effect determines the direction of the induced electric polarization. Our result sheds light on understanding the intriguing giant-induced polarization in CMO and similar compounds with complex magnetic structures.

Abstract: We report the successful growth of CeCuSi single crystals using a metallic flux method and the physical properties using structural, magnetic, electrical transport, optical, and heat capacity measurements. CeCuSi crystallizes in a hexagonal-bar shape, and single crystal x-ray diffraction confirms the ZrBeSi-type structure (space group $P6_{3}/mmc$). CeCuSi orders ferromagnetically below $T_\textrm{C}=15.5$ K with easy magnetization direction within the basal plane. The Ce$^{3+}$ ions are situated within a triangular lattice with a point group of $D_{3d}$. We perform a detailed crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility, the Schottky anomaly in heat capacity, and the Raman-active excitations. The results indicate a ground state doublet with magnetic moment primarily in the basal plane, and a ferromagnetic interaction along both directions. The exponential behavior in resistivity and in heat capacity below $T_\textrm{C}$ can also be well explained by the ferromagnetic magnon model. We found that CeCuSi does not exhibit the CEF hard axis ordering observed in many ferromagnetic Kondo lattice (FM-KL) compounds. Our CEF analysis suggests that the exchange interactions along both axes are ferromagnetic, potentially explaining the absence of hard-axis ordering.

Abstract: We investigate electromagnetic and gravitational radiation generated during a process of the tidal stripping of a white dwarf star circulating a black hole. We model a white dwarf star by a Bose-Fermi droplet and use the quantum hydrodynamic equations to simulate evolution of a black hole-white dwarf binary system. While going through the periastron, the white dwarf loses a small fraction of its mass. The mass falling onto a black hole is a source of powerful electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. Bursts of ultraluminous radiation are flared at each periastron passage. This resembles the recurrent flaring of X-ray sources discovered recently by Irwin {\it et al.}. Gravitational energy bursts occur mainly through emission at very low frequencies. The accretion disc, formed due to stripping of a white dwarf, starts at some point to contribute continuously to radiation of both electromagnetic and gravitational types.

arXiv:2407.09411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling multipulse sequences can be applied to solid state spins for sensing weak oscillating fields from nearby single nuclear spins. By periodically reversing the probing system's evolution, other noises are counteracted and filtered out over the total evolution. However, the technique is subject to intricate interactions resulting in additional resonant responses, which can be misinterpreted with the actual signal intended to be measured. We experimentally characterized three of these effects present in single nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, where we also developed a numerical simulations model without rotating wave approximation, showing robust correlation to the experimental data. Regarding centers with the $^{15}$N nitrogen isotope, we observed that a small misalignment in the bias magnetic field causes the precession of the nitrogen nuclear spin to be sensed by the electronic spin of the center. Another studied case of ambiguous resonances comes from the coupling with lattice $^{13}$C nuclei, where we used the echo modulation frequencies to obtain the interaction Hamiltonian and then utilized the latter to simulate multipulse sequences. Finally, we also measured and simulated the effects from the free evolution of the quantum system during finite pulse durations. Due to the large data volume and the strong dependency of these ambiguous resonances with specific experimental parameters, we provide a simulations dataset with a user-friendly graphical interface, where users can compare simulations with their own experimental data for spectral disambiguation. Although focused with nitrogen vacancy centers and dynamical decoupling sequences, these results and the developed model can potentially be applied to other solid state spins and quantum sensing techniques.

Abstract: In this contribution, we compute the $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of liquid water at ambient conditions. We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while considering also nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate of spin $1/2$ nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions, and is including a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical informations from CCMD trajectories are considered including a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, according to the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H-H vector $D_0\times\tau_\mathrm{HH}$. The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contribution to the $^1$H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike to what was predicted earlier from classical MD simulations.

# Demonstration of OpenMC as a framework for atomic transport and plasma interaction

## OpenMC作为原子传输和等离子体相互作用框架的演示

arXiv:2411.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern tooling is demanded for predicting the transport and reaction characteristics of atoms and molecules, especially in the context of magnetic confinement fusion. DEGAS2, among the most common and capable tools currently in use, shares many fundamental similarities with the OpenMC framework, which was primarily developed for neutron and photon transport. In this work, we demonstrate that OpenMC is suitable for atomic transport calculations. The relative error between the models is small, and the performance of OpenMC is at least comparable to DEGAS2. This is the case even without taking advantage of heterogeneous computing architecture, which is only one of the several remarkable new capabilities that this demonstration heralds.

# Twisted fibre: a photonic topological insulator

## 扭曲光纤: 一种光子拓扑绝缘体

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13064

arXiv:2411.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breaking and enforcing of symmetries is a crucial ingredient in designing topologically robust materials. While magnetic fields can break time-reversal symmetry to create Chern insulators in electronic and microwave systems, at optical frequencies natural materials cannot respond to magnetic fields, which presents a challenge for the scalable exploitation of topologically enhanced devices. Here, we leverage the natural geometry of fibre to build a scalable photonic Chern insulator by twisting the fibre during fabrication. The twist inside optical fibre breaks an effective time-reversal symmetry and induces a pseudo-magnetic field, which we observe via photonic Landau levels. Unavoidably, this twist introduces a competing topology-destroying effect through a parabolic profile in the effective refractive index. Using simulations to guide experimental materials design, we discover the Goldilocks regime where the real-space Chern invariant survives, guaranteeing topological protection against fabrication-induced disorder of any symmetry class.

# Production and Loss Processes of Hydrogen Energetic Neutral Atoms in the Heliosphere from 5 eV to 500 keV

## 从5 eV到500 keV的日光层中氢能中性原子的产生和损失过程

arXiv:2411.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) observations provide valuable insights into the plasma conditions in the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium. Unlike plasma detectors, which measure charged particles tied to the magnetic fields at their location, ENA detectors capture former ions that were neutralized in distant regions and traverse the heliosphere in straight trajectories. ENA fluxes near the Sun represent line-of-sight integrals of parent ion fluxes multiplied by neutralization (production) rates and reduced by the probability of ENA reionization (loss) processes. So far, most ENA analyses have focused on charge exchange between hydrogen atoms and protons as the primary source of ENAs. Here, we examine various ENA production and loss processes throughout the heliosphere in the broad energy range (5 eV to 500 keV) encompassing the next-generation ENA instruments aboard the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission. Our study considers binary collisions involving the most abundant species: protons, electrons, {\alpha}-particles, He+ ions, photons, as well as hydrogen and helium atoms. Our findings indicate that, in addition to ENAs produced by charge exchange of energetic protons with hydrogen atoms, a significant portion of high-energy ENAs originate from the charge exchange with helium atoms. Below 10 keV, the dominant ENA loss processes are charge exchange collisions with protons and photoionization. However, stripping ionization processes, e.g., from collisions with ambient interstellar neutral hydrogen, become the main loss mechanism for higher energies because the charge exchange rate rapidly decreases.

Abstract: We theoretically and numerically elucidate the electrical control over spin waves in antiferromagnetic materials (AFM) with biaxial anisotropies and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The spin wave dispersion in an AFM manifests as a bifurcated spectrum with distinct high-frequency and low-frequency bands. Utilizing a heterostructure comprised of platinum and the AFM, we demonstrate anisotropic control of spin-wave bands via spin currents with three-dimensional spin polarizations, encompassing both resonant and propagating wave modes. Moreover, leveraging the confined geometry, we explore the possibility of controlling spin waves within a spectral domain ranging from tens of gigahertz to sub-terahertz frequencies. The implications of our findings suggest the potential for developing a terahertz wave source with electrical tunability, thereby facilitating its incorporation into ultrafast, broadband, and wireless communication technologies.

# Versatile photonic frequency synthetic dimensions using a single Mach-Zehnder-interferometer-assisted device on thin-film lithium niobate

arXiv:2411.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating physical models with photonic synthetic dimensions has been generating great interest in vast fields of science. The rapid developing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, for its numerous advantages including high electro-optic coefficient and scalability, is well compatible with the realization of synthetic dimensions in the frequency together with spatial domain. While coupling resonators with fixed beam splitters is a common experimental approach, it often lacks tunability and limits coupling between adjacent lattices to sites occupying the same frequency domain positions. Here, on the contrary, we conceive the resonator arrays connected by electro-optic tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers in our configuration instead of fixed beam splitters. By applying bias voltage and RF modulation on the interferometers, our design extends such coupling to long-range scenario and allows for continuous tuning on each coupling strength and synthetic effective magnetic flux. Therefore, our design enriches controllable coupling types that are essential for building programmable lattice networks and significantly increases versatility. As the example, we experimentally fabricate a two-resonator prototype on the TFLN platform, and on this single chip we realize well-known models including tight-binding lattices, topological Hall ladder and Creutz ladder. We directly observe the band structures in the quasi-momentum space and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking and the Aharonov-Bohm cage effect. These results demonstrate the potential for convenient simulations of more complex models in our configuration.

# Upgrade of the Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injector for the RFX-mod2 experiment

## 用于RFX-mod2实验的诊断中性束注入器的升级

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13373

arXiv:2411.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma Physics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.

# Oscillations of subcritical fast magnetosonic shock boundaries caused by shock reformation

## 由冲击重整引起的亚临界快速磁声冲击边界的振荡

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13434

arXiv:2411.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of a deformed subcritical fast magnetosonic shock front is compared between two two-dimensional PIC simulations with different orientations of the magnetic field relative to the simulation box. All other initial and simulation conditions are kept identical. Shock boundary oscillations are observed in the simulation where the magnetic field direction is resolved. This oscillation is caused by the reformation of the shock front. One part of the front acts as a shock, while the other functions as a magnetic piston, with both halves changing their states in antiphase. The oscillation period corresponds to the time required for one shock wave to grow as the other collapses. In contrast, the corrugated fast magnetosonic shock does not oscillate in the second simulation, where the magnetic field is oriented out of the simulation plane. This dependence on magnetic field orientation suggests that the shock oscillation is induced by magnetic tension, which is only effective in the first simulation. In both simulations, the shock perturbation does not grow over time, indicating that the shocks are stable. The potential relevance of these findings for the Alfv\'enic oscillations of the supercritical Earth's bow shock, detected by the MMS multi-spacecraft mission, is also discussed.

arXiv:2411.12864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the spin contributions to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) in transition metals. The IFE is primarily driven by spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced asymmetry between excited electron and hole spin moments. Our results reveal that even elements with smaller electron magnetic moments, like Os, can exhibit higher IFE due to greater electron-hole asymmetry. Pt shows the highest IFE in the 1 - 2 eV frequency range, while Os dominates in the 2 - 4 eV range. In addition, we demonstrate that the IFE of neighboring elements with similar crystal structures (e.g., Ir, Pt, and Au) can be tuned by adjusting their Fermi levels, indicating the importance of d electron filling on IFE. Finally, we find that the trend in electron (or hole) contributions to the IFE closely follows that of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC), however, the total IFE involves more complex interactions.

# Omnidirectional Wireless Power Transfer for Millimetric Magnetoelectric Biomedical Implants

## 用于毫米级磁电生物医学植入物的全向无线功率传输

arXiv:2411.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniature bioelectronic implants promise revolutionary therapies for cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a significant method for miniaturization, eliminating the need for bulky batteries in devices. Despite successful demonstrations of millimetric battery free implants in animal models, the robustness and efficiency of WPT are known to degrade significantly under misalignment incurred by body movements, respiration, heart beating, and limited control of implant orientation during surgery. This article presents an omnidirectional WPT platform for millimetric bioelectronic implants, employing the emerging magnetoelectric (ME) WPT modality, and magnetic field steering technique based on multiple transmitter (TX) coils. To accurately sense the weak coupling in a miniature implant and adaptively control the multicoil TX array in a closed loop, we develop an active echo (AE) scheme using a tiny coil on the implant. Our prototype comprises a fully integrated 14.2 mm3 implantable stimulator embedding a custom low power system on chip (SoC) powered by an ME film, a TX with a custom three channel AE RX chip, and a multicoil TX array with mutual inductance cancellation. The AE RX achieves negative 161 dBm per Hz input referred noise with 64 dB gain tuning range to reliably sense the AE signal, and offers fast polarity detection for driver control. AE simultaneously enhances the robustness, efficiency, and charging range of ME WPT. Under 90 degree rotation from the ideal position, our omnidirectional WPT system achieves 6.8x higher power transfer efficiency (PTE) than a single coil baseline. The tracking error of AE negligibly degrades the PTE by less than 2 percent from using ideal control.

# Magnetoelastic Interactions Reduce Hysteresis in Soft Magnets

## 磁弹性相互作用可减少软磁体的磁滞

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12875

arXiv:2411.12875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The width of the magnetic hysteresis loop is often correlated with the material's magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant $\kappa_1$. Traditionally, a common approach to reduce the hysteresis width has been to develop alloys with $\kappa_1$ as close to zero as possible. However, contrary to this widely accepted view, we present evidence that magnetoelastic interactions governed by magnetostriction constants, elastic stiffness, and applied stresses play an important role in reducing magnetic hysteresis width, despite large $\kappa_1$ values. We use a nonlinear micromagnetics framework to systematically investigate the interplay between material constants $\lambda_{100}$, $c_{11}$, $c_{12}$, $\kappa_1$, applied or residual stresses $\sigma_{\mathrm{R}}$, and needle domains to collectively lower the energy barrier for magnetization reversal. A distinguishing feature of our work is that we correlate the energy barrier governing the growth of needle domains with the width of the hysteresis loop. This energy barrier approach enables us to capture the nuanced interplay between anisotropy constant, magnetostriction, and applied stresses, and their combined influence on magnetic hysteresis. We propose a mathematical relationship on the coercivity map: $\kappa_1 = \alpha(c_{11}-c_{12})(\lambda_{100}+\beta\sigma_{11})^2$ for which magnetic hysteresis can be minimized for a uniaxial residual stress $\sigma_\mathrm{R} = \sigma_{11}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1\otimes\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1$ (and for some constants $\alpha$, $\beta$). These results serve as quantitative guidelines to design magnetic alloys with small hysteresis, and potentially guide the discovery of a new generation of soft magnets located beyond the $\kappa_1 \to 0$ region.

# Time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles

arXiv:2411.13087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.

Abstract: Skyrmions are topological defects belonging to nontrivial homotopy classes in particle theory, and are recognized as a suitable unit in the high-density, low-dissipation microelectronic devices in condensed matter physics. Their remarkably stable topology has recently been observed in electromagnetic waves. For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we introduce the concept of moir\'e optical skyrmion clusters, where multi-skyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster that is either crystallized or quasi-crystallized as a consequence of the twisted nanostructures. The rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved in the imperfectly aligned composite nanostructures. This moir\'e optical skyrmion interaction mechanism is described by a lattice model. Further, the nucleation and collapse of optical skyrmion are studied, where their nanoscale dynamics are revealed with a tiny change of the twist angle. The sudden reversal of the on-chip skyrmion can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between twisted composite nanostructures.

Abstract: In this contribution, we compute the $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of liquid water at ambient conditions. We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while considering also nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate of spin $1/2$ nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions, and is including a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical informations from CCMD trajectories are considered including a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, according to the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H-H vector $D_0\times\tau_\mathrm{HH}$. The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contribution to the $^1$H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike to what was predicted earlier from classical MD simulations.

Abstract: Probing electrical and magnetic properties in aqueous environments remains a frontier challenge in nanoscale sensing. Our inability to do so with quantitative accuracy imposes severe limitations, for example, on our understanding of the ionic environments in a diverse array of systems, ranging from novel materials to the living cell. The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has emerged as a good candidate to sense temperature, pH, and the concentration of paramagnetic species at the nanoscale, but comes with several hurdles such as particle-to-particle variation which render calibrated measurements difficult, and the challenge to tightly confine and precisely position sensors in aqueous environment. To address this, we demonstrate relaxometry with NV centers within optically-trapped FNDs. In a proof of principle experiment, we show that optically-trapped FNDs enable highly reproducible nanomolar sensitivity to the paramagnetic ion, (\mathrm{Gd}^{3+}). We capture the three distinct phases of our experimental data by devising a model analogous to nanoscale Langmuir adsorption combined with spin coherence dynamics. Our work provides a basis for routes to sense free paramagnetic ions and molecules in biologically relevant conditions.

# Extreme heating of minor ions in imbalanced solar-wind turbulence

arXiv:2408.04703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minor ions in the solar corona are heated to extreme temperatures, far in excess of those of the electrons and protons that comprise the bulk of the plasma. These highly non-thermal distributions make minor ions sensitive probes of the underlying collisionless heating processes, which are crucial to coronal heating and the creation of the solar wind. The recent discovery of the "helicity barrier" offers a mechanism where imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in low-beta plasmas preferentially heats protons over electrons, generating high-frequency, proton-cyclotron-resonant fluctuations. We use the hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell code, Pegasus++, to drive imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in a 3D low-beta plasma with additional passive ion species, He$^{2+}$ and O$^{5+}$. A helicity barrier naturally develops, followed by clear phase-space signatures of oblique ion-cyclotron-wave heating and Landau-resonant heating from the imbalanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations. The former results in characteristically arced ion velocity distribution functions, whose non-bi-Maxwellian features are shown by linear ALPS calculations to be critical to the heating process. Additional features include a steep transition-range electromagnetic spectrum, the presence of ion-cyclotron waves propagating in the direction of imbalance, significantly enhanced proton-to-electron heating ratios, anisotropic ion temperatures that are significantly more perpendicular with respect to magnetic field, and extreme heating of heavier species in a manner consistent with empirically derived mass scalings informed by measurements. None of these features are realized in an otherwise equivalent simulation of balanced turbulence. If seen simultaneously in the fast solar wind, these signatures of the helicity barrier would testify to the necessity of incorporating turbulence imbalance in a complete theory for the evolution of the solar wind.

Abstract: The study of the scattering of electromagnetic waves by a linear isotropic medium with planar symmetry can be reduced to that of their TE and TM modes. For situations where the medium consists of parallel homogeneous slabs, one may use the standard transfer matrix technique to address the scattering problem for these modes. We extend the utility of this technique to inhomogeneous permittivity and permeability profiles by proposing a dynamical formulation of the scattering of TE and TM waves in which the transfer matrix for the medium is given in terms of the evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. This leads to a system of dynamical equations for the reflection and transmission amplitudes. Decoupling these equations we reduce the solution of the scattering problem for TE and TM modes to that of an initial-value problem for a Riccati equation. We discuss the application of this observation in identifying media that do not reflect TE or TM waves with given wavenumber and incidence angle.

Reusable catalysts based on non-noble metals with broad applicability used in nitrile catalytic hydrogenation synthesis are a key to a more sustainable production of primary amine. Herein, a simple and efficient carbon-coated non-noble metal nickel-based catalyst (Ni/NiO@C-600-200-1-H2O) was prepared for the hydrogenation of aromatic substituted nitrile to aromatic substituted amine under mild conditions (120 °C, 10 bar H2, 4 h). The carbon-coated catalyst has excellent anti-agglomeration ability due to its special carbon-coated metal structure, which can enhance the cyclic stability of the catalyst. Several aromatic substituted nitriles containing diffident functional groups such as halogen, methyl, methoxy, etc. are well tolerated in the Ni-based catalytic hydrogenation and can be converted to the corresponding amine with high activities (conversion rate over 99%, product selectivity reached 98.25%). Moreover, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused due to its magnetic nature. In addition, we also applied the catalyst to the continuous flow reactor to catalyze benzylamine hydrogenation of benzonitrile under optimized conditions, the conversion rate and selectivity of the reaction were > 99%, and the continuous operation time was up to 31 h.

Heterogeneous catalysis plays a critical role in many industrial processes, including the production of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, and research to improve current catalytic processes is important to make chemical industry more sustainable. Despite its importance, the challenge of identifying optimal catalysts with the required activity and selectivity persists, demanding a detailed understanding of the complex interactions between catalysts and reactants at various length and time scales. Density functional theory (DFT) has been the workhorse in modelling heterogeneous catalysis for more than three decades. While DFT has been instrumental, this review explores the application of quantum computing algorithms in modelling heterogeneous catalysis, which could bring a paradigm shift in our approach to understanding catalytic interfaces. Bridging academic and industrial perspectives, focusing on emerging materials such as multi-component alloys, single-atom catalysts, and magnetic catalysts, we delve into the limitations of DFT in capturing strong correlation effects and spin-related phenomena. The review also presents important algorithms and their applications relevant to heterogeneous catalysis modelling, showcasing advancements in the field. Additionally, the review explores embedding strategies where quantum computing algorithms handle strongly correlated regions, while traditional quantum chemistry algorithms address the remainder, offering a promising approach for large-scale heterogeneous catalysis modelling. Looking forward, ongoing investments by academia and industry reflect a growing enthusiasm for quantum computing's potential in heterogeneous catalysis research. The review concludes by envisioning a future where quantum computing algorithms seamlessly integrate into research workflows, propelling us into a new era of computational chemistry and thereby reshaping the landscape of modelling heterogeneous catalysis.

The complex [{Ni(cyclen)}2Cr12NiF18(O2CtBu)24] (where cyclen = 1,4,7,10-tetrazacyclododecane) crystallises as a fifteen-metal chain that is shaped like a seahorse. Given this is one of the longest finite, paramagnetic chains found, we were intrigued whether this unusual structure is induced during crystal growth or also maintained in other phases. We report electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrating that the S-structure from crystal is stable in powder and solution. Using ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), we revealed the coexistence of S-shaped structures and a closed isomeric assembly in the gas phase. Collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry studies monitored by IM-MS show the rearrangement of the cyclic seahorse to the S-shaped conformation, as well as the dissociation to a cyclic, seven-metal complex.

# A Novel Approach to Detect CD4 T-Lymphocytes Using a Microfluidic Chip and Compact Signal Processing Circuit

## 使用微流控芯片和紧凑的信号处理电路检测CD4 T淋巴细胞的新方法

CD4 T-lymphocytes (CD4 cells) are a type of T lymphocyte that plays an important role in the immune system, helping to fight germs and protect the body from disease. Accurate enumeration of CD4 T cells is crucial for assessing immune health and diagnosing various diseases. This study presents the development and validation of a novel microfluidic biochip system designed for the detection and counting of CD4 T cells using impedance measurements. The proposed system integrated a cell detection chip with a cost-effective signal processing circuit, which included an instrumental amplifier and a highly sensitive lock-in amplifier. The sensing structure, created using advanced microfabrication technology, consists of three microelectrodes and a 50 &amp;micro;m &amp;times; 50 &amp;micro;m measurement aperture. The detection principle relied on the impedance imbalance caused by the presence of CD4 T cells in the fluidic flow between adjacent sensing electrodes. The system's performance was validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating high accuracy in detecting and counting CD4 T cells separated from whole blood based on their magnetic properties. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system was simpler, faster, and more cost-effective compared to traditional laser flow cytometry. Furthermore, the system&amp;rsquo;s portability and ease of use made it highly suitable for point-of-care diagnostics and on-site cell analysis. The utilization of microfabrication technology and impedance measurement not only enhanced efficiency and accuracy but also offered a reliable solution for rapid biological cell detection. Future work will focus on enhancing the throughput and miniaturizing the sensing structure to align with the high standards of conventional flow cytometry while maintaining cost-effectiveness and simplicity. This research lays a solid foundation for the development of advanced lab-on-a-chip technologies for biological cell detection and analysis, promising significant improvements in healthcare diagnostics and monitoring.

# Overlap Syndrome Involving Multiple Sclerosis and Kikuchi&ndash;Fujimoto Disease Following COVID-19 Vaccination: A Case Report

## COVID-19疫苗接种后涉及多发性硬化症和菊池-藤本病的重叠综合征: 一例病例报告

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5338211/latest

Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system, while Kikuchi&ndash;Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare type of lymphadenitis. The overlap of MS with KFD following COVID-19 vaccination has not been previously reported.
Case presentation: A 23-year-old Asian woman presented with lymphadenopathy and diplopia following COVID-19 vaccination. A biopsy of the cervical lymph node confirmed KFD, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed demyelinating lesions consistent with MS. The presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-specific oligoclonal bands met the criteria for dissemination in time. The final diagnosis was MS overlapping with KFD. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin followed by dimethyl fumarate capsules to prevent recurrence. Three years later, she experienced dizziness and diplopia again. Follow-up MRI of the brain revealed multiple abnormal signals in both the cortical and subcortical regions, with some areas showing partial enhancement, suggesting a relapse of MS. After administering another steroid pulse therapy, the disease-modifying therapy was switched to ofatumumab. Follow-up assessment demonstrated significant improvement in the patient&rsquo;s dizziness and diplopia.
Conclusion: This case is the first to describe the occurrence of MS overlapping with KFD following COVID-19 vaccination. This case demonstrates that shared pathogenic mechanisms and common genetic susceptibilities may contribute to the simultaneous development of both conditions. Close monitoring is essential to exclude the potential presence of lymphoproliferative disorders and autoimmune diseases.

Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) are large eruptions of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun, causing significant disturbances through the heliosphere. Their internal structure and complexity are yet unresolved due lack of suitable observations and simulations. We present the results of a high- resolution simulation capable for the first time of capturing the formation and evolution of small- to mesoscale structures in a CME demonstrating significant increases in complexity. These structures dynamically form in our simulation initialized using the solar maximum conditions of September 2014 in which the heliospheric current sheet is vertically inclined running over the poles and where the CME interacts with a preceding slow-fast stream interaction region. The simulation of this interaction is performed with the Alfv ́en Wave Solar Atmosphere Model (AWSoM). With AWSoM, we first produce the background solar wind condition using a synoptic magnetic field map for Carrington Rotation 2154. The CME is initiated from active region (AR) 12158 applying a Gibson-Low magnetic flux rope with parameters to produce a fast CME. With the use of high-resolution grids, we capture magnetic reconnection within the leading extremity of CME, resulting in the formation of mesoscale flux ropes, containing sufficiently strong magnetic fields (&sim; 30 nT) to affect planetary magnetospheres. Finally, we use a tetrahedral configuration of four virtual probes, corresponding to the Space Weather Investigation Frontier (SWIFT) mission concept, to show that the mission can uniquely resolve the spatial characteristics and temporal evolution of reconnecting current sheets within the CME, as well as the resulting small- to mesoscale structures.

In a collisionless plasma environment, wave-particle interaction is an important process that enables efficient energy exchange between particles and phase-coherent waves. We first discovered two layers bridge-like arcs structure in the energy spectrum formed by the simultaneous anomalous resonance interaction of Electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves with protons and He+ by Magnetospheric Multiscale mission observations. Meanwhile, our analysis results illustrate that the existence of distinct energy conversion between particles and Electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves by using the Wave-Particle Interaction Analyzer. Although accounting for corrections to the traditional resonance condition, the resonance energy between protons（H+）and EMIC waves remains significantly higher than the observed values, indicating that the interaction between protons and EMIC waves is an anomalous resonance process. In contrast, the resonance energy between He+ and EMIC waves is closer to the observed values, the observed parallel velocity of the particles is lower than the resonance velocity, meaning it still qualifies as anomalous resonance.
