# Variational approach to the dynamics of dissipative quantum impurity models

## 耗散量子杂质模型动力学的变分方法

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13638

arXiv:2411.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments with quantum simulators using ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits have demonstrated the potential of controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for realizing correlated many-body states. However, determining the dynamics of dissipative quantum many-body systems remains a significant analytical and numerical challenge. In this work, we focus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological developments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that combines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the quantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative impurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses and embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full crossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature of the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing comprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation regime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can induce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin relaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an exotic "reverse conductance" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a counter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation and finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic domains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using localized dissipation.

# CeCo$_2$P$_2$: a unique Co-antiferromagnetic topological heavy-fermion system with $P\cdot\mathcal{T}$-protected Kondo effect and nodal-line excitations

arXiv:2411.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on high-throughput screening and experimental data, we find that CeCo$_2$P$_2$ is unique in heavy-fermion materials: it has a Kondo effect at a high temperature which is nonetheless below a Co-antiferromagnetic ordering temperature. This begs the question: how is the Kondo singlet formed? All other magnetic Kondo materials do not first form magnetism on the atoms whose electrons are supposed to screen the local moments. We theoretically explain these observations and show the multifaceted uniqueness of CeCo$_2$P$_2$: a playground for Kondo, magnetism, flat band, and topological physics. At high temperatures, the itinerant Co $c$ electrons of the system form non-atomic bands with a narrow bandwidth, leading to a high antiferromagnetic transition temperature. We show that the quantum geometry of the bands promotes in-plane ferromagnetism, while the weak dispersion along the $z$ direction facilitates out-of-plane antiferromagnetism. At low temperatures, we uncover a novel phase that manifests the coexistence of Co-antiferromagnetism and the Kondo effect, linked to the $P\cdot \mathcal{T}$-protected Kramers' doublets and the filling-enforced metallic nature of $c$ electrons in the antiferromagnetic phase. Subsequently, the emergence of the Kondo effect, in cooperation with glide-mirror-$z$ symmetry, creates nodal-line excitation near the Fermi energy. Our results emphasize the importance of lattice symmetry and quantum geometry, Kondo physics, and magnetism in the understanding of the correlation physics of this unique compound. We also test our theory on the structurally similar compound LaCo$_2$P$_2$ and show how we are able to understand its vastly different phase diagram.

Abstract: Magnetic transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been of particular interest due to their unique magnetic properties and layered structure that can be promising for a wide range of spintronic applications. One of the most exciting compounds in this family of magnets is chromium telluride, Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$, which has shown rich magnetic phases with varied Cr concentrations. An emergent antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering has been found in Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ (equivalently, Cr$_{5}$Te$_8$), which is induced by intercalating 0.25 Cr atom per unit cell within the van der Waals (vdW) gaps of CrTe$_2$. In this work, we report an increased N\'eel Temperature ($T_\mathrm{N}$) of the AFM phase in Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ by slightly reducing the concentration of Cr intercalants. Moreover, the intercalated Cr atoms form a metastable 2$\times$2 supercell structure that can be manipulated by electron beam irradiation. This work offers a promising approach to tuning magnetic and structural properties by adjusting the concentration of self-intercalated magnetic atoms.

# The Gr\"uneisen parameter applied to critical phenomena and experimental investigations of correlated phenomena in molecular conductors

arXiv:2411.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Ph.D. Thesis, a systematic review is performed on the derivation and generalization of the Gr\"uneisen parameter followed by its unprecedented applications to several distinct scenarios, such as magnetic model systems, zero-field quantum phase transitions, the maximization of caloric effects close to any critical-end point based on entropy arguments, the here-proposed adiabatic magnetization of a paramagnetic salt, as well as for Cosmology in the frame of the universe expansion. Since this Ph.D. Thesis is a symbiosis between theoretical and experimental results, an experimental investigation of correlated phenomena was carried out for molecular conductors of the (TMTTF)$_2$X family, where TMTTF is the base molecule tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene and X a monovalent counter-anion such as PF$_6$, SbF$_6$, or AsF$_6$. Such strongly correlated electron systems are considered suitable ones for the exploration of Mott insulating phase, charge-ordering, spin-Peierls, and superconductivity. In particular, the investigation of a possible multiferroic character in these salts was performed via quasi-static (low-frequency) dielectric constant $\varepsilon'$ measurements as a function of temperature where a maximum in $\varepsilon'$ as a function of temperature was observed at the corresponding charge-ordering temperature for both hydrogenated and 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$SbF$_6$ salts. Furthermore, Raman measurements were performed on the 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, showing a possible magneto-optical effect on the $\nu_4(a_g)$ vibrational mode of the TMTTF molecule. Yet, fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the fully-hydrogenated (TMTTF)$_2$AsF$_6$ presents an expressive fluorescence background, which is roughly five orders of magnitude lower than that for the 97.5% deuterated variant of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$.

# Xenon-metal pair formation in UO2 investigated using DFT+U

arXiv:2411.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experimental study on a spent uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel sample from Belgium Reactor3 (BR3) identified a unique pair structure formed by the noble metal phase (NMP) and fission gas (xenon [Xe]) precipitate. However, the fundamental mechanism behind this structure remains unclear. The present study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between five different metal precipitates (molybdenum [Mo], ruthenium [Ru], palladium [Pd], technetium [Tc], and rhodium [Rh]) and the Xe fission gas atoms in UO2, by using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with the Hubbard U correction to compute the formation energies involved. All DFT+U calculations were performed with occupation matrix control to ensure antiferromagnetic ordering of UO2. The calculated formation energies of the Xe and solid fission products in the NMP reveal that these metal precipitates form stable structures with Xe in the following order: Mo > Tc > Ru > Pd > Rh. Notably, the formation energy of Xe-metal pairs is lower than that of the isolated single defects in all instances, with Mo showing the most negative formation energy, likely accounting for the observed pair structure formation.

# Hidden altermagnetism

## 隐藏的地磁

arXiv:2411.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden spin polarization (HSP) with zero net spin polarization in total but non-zero local spin polarization has been proposed in certain nonmagnetic centrosymmetric compounds, where the individual sectors forming the inversion partners are all inversion asymmetry. Here, we extend this idea to antiferromagnetic materials with $PT$ symmetry (the joint symmetry of space inversion symmetry ($P$) and time-reversal symmetry ($T$)), producing zero net spin polarization in total, but either of the two inversion-partner sectors possesses altermagnetism, giving rise to non-zero local spin polarization in the real space, dubbed "hidden altermagnetism". By first-principle calculations, we predict that $PT$-symmetric bilayer $\mathrm{Cr_2SO}$ can serve as a possible candidate showing altermagnetic HSP. By applying an external electric field to break the global $P$ symmetry, the hidden altermagnetism can be separated and observed experimentally. Our works extend the hidden physics, and will also advance the theoretical and experimental search for new type of spin-polarized materials.

# Discovery of an Antiferromagnetic Topological Nodal-line Kondo Semimetal

## 反铁磁拓扑节线Kondo半金属的发现

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13898

arXiv:2411.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symbiosis of strong interactions, flat bands, topology and symmetry has led to the discovery of exotic phases of matter, including fractional Chern insulators, correlated moir\'e topological superconductors, and Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Correlated metals, such as those present in Kondo lattices, rely on the screening of local moments by a sea of non-magnetic conduction electrons. Here, we report on a unique topological Kondo lattice compound, CeCo2P2, where the Kondo effect - whose existence under the magnetic Co phase is protected by PT symmetry - coexists with antiferromagnetic order emerging from the flat bands associated with the Co atoms. Remarkably, this is the only known Kondo lattice compound where magnetic order occurs in non-heavy electrons, and puzzlingly, at a temperature significantly higher than that of the Kondo effect. Furthermore, at low temperatures, the emergence of the Kondo effect, in conjunction with a glide-mirror-z symmetry, results in a nodal line protected by bulk topology near the Fermi energy. These unusual properties, arising from the interplay between itinerant and correlated electrons from different constituent elements, lead to novel quantum phases beyond the celebrated topological Kondo insulators and Weyl Kondo semimetals. CeCo2P2 thus provides an ideal platform for investigating narrow bands, topology, magnetism, and the Kondo effect in strongly correlated electron systems.

arXiv:2411.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions of the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and gradient magnetic field. Introducing appropariate raising and lowering operators, we exactly solve the linear system. Analyzing the obtained energy spectrum, we conclude that simultaneous variation of the magnetic-field gradient and SOC strength leads to the transition of excited states into the GS. As a result, any excited state can transition to the GS, at appropriate values of the system's parameters. The nonlinear system is solved numerically, showing that the GS phase transition, similar to the one in the linear system, still exists under the action of the repulsive nonlinearity. In the case of weak attraction, a mixed state appears near the GS transition point, while the GS transitions into an edge state under the action of strong attractive interaction.

arXiv:2411.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty of the nature of the normal state and superconducting condensate of unconventional superconductors continues to stimulate considerable speculation about the mechanism of superconductivity in these materials. Of particular interest are the type of symmetry of the order parameter and the basic electronic characteristics of the superconducting and normal states. We report the derivation of temperature dependences of the superconducting condensate plasma frequency, superfluid density, and London penetration depth by measuring terahertz spectra of conductivity and dielectric permittivity of the Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ thin films with different Ni concentrations. A comprehensive analysis of the experimental data was performed in the framework of the simple three-band Eliashberg model under the assumption that the superconducting coupling mechanism is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. The results of independent experiments support the choice of model parameters. Based on calculations of the temperature dependences of superconducting gaps, we may conclude that the obtained results are compatible with the scenario, in which Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ is a multiband superconductor with s$_\pm $-wave pairing symmetry.

# Suppression of Intrinsic Hall Effect through Competing Berry Curvature in Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$

arXiv:2411.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic and electronic transport properties of the layered chalcogenide Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$ in its single crystalline form. This material exhibits a ferromagnetic transition at a critical temperature of $T_C = 191$ K, characterized by significant thermal hysteresis in the magnetization data below this temperature. Measurements of isothermal magnetization, magnetocaloric effect, and magnetoresistance indicate that the system exhibits strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy, with the $c$-axis serving as the easy axis of magnetization. The Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$ compound shows pronounced anomalous Hall effect (AHE); however, existing experimental and theoretical data do not provide a clear understanding of the nature and origin of this phenomenon. Our experimental findings suggest that the skew scattering mechanism primarily accounts for the observed AHE. In contrast, our theoretical study reveals the presence of gapped nodal points accompanied by non-zero Berry Curvature, which are expected to contribute towards intrinsic AHE. A detailed analysis of the electronic band structure, obtained through density functional theory calculations, reveals that the Berry Curvature at different nodal points exhibit both positive and negative signs. These opposing contributions largely cancel each other out, thereby significantly diminishing the intrinsic contribution to the AHE.

# Photon drag at the junction between metal and 2d semiconductor

## 金属与2d半导体交界处的光子阻力

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14075

arXiv:2411.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon drag represents a mechanism of photocurrent generation wherein the electromagnetic (EM) field momentum is transferred directly to the charge carriers. It is believed to be small by the virtue of low photon momentum compared to the typical momenta of the charge carriers. Here, we show that photon drag becomes particularly strong at the junctions between metals and 2d materials, wherein highly non-uniform local EM fields are generated upon diffraction. To this end, we combine an exact theory of diffraction at 'metal-2d material' junctions with microscopic transport theory of photon drag, and derive the functional dependences of the respective photovoltage on the parameters of EM field and 2d system. The voltage responsivity appears inversely proportional to the electromagnetic frequency $\omega$, the sheet density of charge, and a dimensionless momentum transfer coefficient $\alpha$ which depends only on 2d conductivity in units of light speed $\eta = 2\pi \sigma/c$ and light polarization. For $p$-polarized incident light, the momentum transfer coefficient appears finite even for vanishingly small 2d conductivity $\eta$, which is a consequence of dynamic lightning rod effect. For $s$-polarized incident light, the momentum transfer coefficient scales as $\eta \ln \eta^{-1}$, which stems from long-range dipole radiation of a linear junction. A simple estimate shows that the ratio of thermoelectric and photon drag photovoltages at the junction for $p$-polarization is roughly $\omega\tau_\varepsilon$, where $\tau_\varepsilon$ is the energy relaxation time, while for $s$-polarization the photon drag always dominates over the thermoelectric effect.

Abstract: We revisit the challenging problem of identifying the quantum spin liquid candidate in the spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. By integrating the Gutzwiller-guided density matrix renormalization group method with analytical analyses, we present clear evidence that the ground state is a Z$_2$ Dirac spin liquid. This state can be efficiently described by a Gutzwiller-projected parton theory characterized by its projective symmetry group. To distinguish the difference between the projected Z$_2$ and U(1) parton state, we investigate the chiral spin liquid ground states as topological orders by incorporating a $J_\chi$ term into the $J_1$-$J_2$ model and observe a transition from a Z$_2$ chiral spin liquid to a U(1)$_2$ chiral spin liquid as $J_\chi$ increases.

Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals combine liquid-like fluidity and orientational order of conventional nematics with macroscopic electric polarization comparable in magnitude to solid state ferroelectric materials. Here, we present a systematic study of twenty-seven homologous materials with various fluorination patterns, giving new insight into the molecular origins of spontaneous polar ordering in fluid ferroelectric nematics. Beyond our initial expectations, we find the highest stability of the NF phase to be in materials with specific fluorination patterns rather than the maximal fluorination which might be expected based on simple models. We find a delicate balance between polar and apolar nematics which is entirely dictated by the substitution of the fluorine atoms. Aided by electronic structure calculations, we show this to have its origins in the radial distribution of charge across the molecular surface, with molecules possessing a more oscillatory distribution of electrons across their surfaces possessing a higher propensity to form polar nematic phases. This work provides a new set of ground rules and designing principles which can inform the synthesis of future ferroelectric nematogens.

arXiv:2411.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal the visible influence of the ultra-small concentrations (1 wt.% or less) of the BaTiO3 nanoparticles (average size 24 nm) on the current-voltage characteristics and capacitance of the dielectric liquid crystal (LC) 5CB. The pure LC cell demonstrates higher current (and thus smaller resistance) than the LC cells filled with a very small concentration (0.5-1) wt.% of BTO nanoparticles. The same trend is observed for the charge-voltage characteristics: the capacitance loop is the widest for the pure LC cell and becomes noticeably thinner in the presence of (0.5-1) wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles. This seems counterintuitive, because 1 wt.% of ferroelectric nanoparticles very slightly modify the effective dielectric response and should not influence on the director distribution and elastic properties of the LC. We conclude that a possible physical reason of this observation is the influence of the ionic-electronic screening charges, which cover the ferroelectric nanoparticles and become polarized in the external field, on the ionic transport in the LC.

# Angular dependence of large negative magnetoresistance in a field-induced Weyl semimetal candidate HoAuSn

## 场诱导的Weyl半金属候选HoAuSn中大负磁阻的角度依赖性

arXiv:2411.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular dependence of magnetoresistance (MR) in antiferromagnetic half-Heusler HoAuSn single crystals have been systematically studied. Negative MR, as large as 99%, is observed at 9 T, is not restricted to the specific configuration of applied magnetics fields and current, and can persist up to 20 K, much higher than the Neel temperature (TN 1.9 K). Experiments and first-principles calculations suggest that the observed large negative MR is derived from a magnetic field that reconstructs the band structure and induces a Weyl point, which changes the carrier concentration. Taking into consideration that large negative MR has so far been rarely reported, especially in antiferromagnetic materials, it is anticipated that the present work not only offers a guideline for searching materials with large negative MR but also helps to further realize other exotic topological electronic states in a large class of antiferromagnetic half-Heusler compounds.

arXiv:2411.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spintronic terahertz emitters, THz radiation is generated by exciting an ultrafast spin current through femtosecond laser excitation of a ferromagnetic-nonmagnetic metallic heterostructure. Although an extensive phenomenological knowledge has been built up during the last decade, a solid theoretical modeling that connects the generated THz signal to the laser induced-spin current is still incomplete. Here, starting from general solutions to Maxwell's equations, we model the electric field generated by a superdiffusive spin current in spintronic emitters, taking Co/Pt as a typical example. We explicitly include the detector shape which is shown to significantly influence the detected THz radiation. Additionally, the electron energy dependence of the spin Hall effect is taken into account, as well as the duration of the exciting laser pulse and thickness of the detector crystal. Our modeling leads to realistic emission profiles and highlights the role of the detection method for distinguishing key features of the spintronic THz emission.

# Ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism

arXiv:2411.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism effect, the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is coupled to the switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. We demonstrate the design principles for the ferroelectric altermagnets and the additional symmetry constraints necessary for switching the altermagnetic spin splitting through flipping the electric polarization based on the state-of-the-art spin-group symmetry techniques. 22 ferroelectric altermagnets are found by screening through the 2001 experimental reported magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database and 2 of them are identified as ferroelectric switchable altermagnets. Using the hybrid improper ferroelectric material [C(NH2)3]Cr(HCOO)3 as an example, we show how the altermagnetic spin splitting is tightly coupled to the ferroelectric polarization, providing an ideal platform for designing electric-field-controllable multiferroic devices. Finally, we find that such manipulation of altermagnetism can be detected by monitoring the physical quantities that are related to the non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole, such as the linearly polarized photogalvanic spin current.

# Ground-state magnetic structures of topological kagome metals RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er)

arXiv:2411.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic kagome metals have attracted tremendous research interests recently, because they represent an ideal playground for exploring the fascinating interplay between their intrinsically inherited topologically non-trivial electron band structures, magnetism and electronic correlation effects, and the resultant novel electronic/magnetic states and emergent excitations. In this work, we report a comprehensive single-crystal neutron diffraction investigation of the ground-state magnetic structures of the recently discovered V-based topological kagome metals RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er). Furthermore, the sample synthesis details and our systematic studies of crystal structure, low-temperature magnetic and thermodynamic properties of these compounds via various in-house characterization techniques are also reported. It can be revealed that RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho) have a collinear ferromagnetic order in the ground state, with the ordered magnetic moment aligned along the c axis for R = Tb, Ho, while approximately 20${^\circ}$ tilted off from the c axis for R = Dy. In contrast, ErV$_6$Sn$_6$ shows an A-type antiferromagnetic structure with a magnetic propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.5), and with the ordered magnetic moment aligned in the ab plane. A comparison of the low-temperature magnetic structures for both the extensively investigated topological kagome metal series of RV$_6$Sn$_6$ and RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ is given in details. This allows to gain new insights into the complex magnetic interactions, diverse single-ion magnetic anisotropies and spin dynamics in these compounds. The reported ground-state magnetic structures in RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) can pave the way for further explorations of the possible interplay between magnetism and topologically non-trivial electron band structures in the magnetically ordered phase regime.

# Low-Field Regime of Magnon Transport in Yttrium Iron Garnet

## 钇铁石榴石中磁振子输运的低场状态

arXiv:2411.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive propagation of spin waves and their quanta - magnons - in the archetypal magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is under a surge of research for low-power and low-loss data communication. However, operation under external magnetic fields reduces magnon diffusion length, attenuates the voltage amplitude at measurement terminals, and complicates the architecture of magnonic devices. Here, we explore the low-field and field-free regime of diffusive magnon transport in YIG films. We demonstrate that the field-induced suppression of magnon diffusion length can be fully inhibited only at the zero-field limit. Even a modest field of 10mT attenuates the non-local spin voltage by $\sim$ 20$\%$ in a transport channel of $\sim$ 1$\mu$m long. Using Stoner-Wohlfarth macrospin simulations, we reveal that an often overlooked, in-plane uniaxial anisotropy becomes the critical parameter governing the field-free operation of magnonic devices. We further demonstrate a tenfold enhancement in the effective field associated with the in-plane uniaxial anisotropy of YIG films at low temperatures - a key finding for field-free operation of magnonic devices under cryogenic conditions.

# One Loop Thermal Effective Action

arXiv:2411.14146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the one loop effective action for a Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature, in the presence of background gauge fields, employing the Heat-Kernel method. This method enables us to compute the thermal corrections to the Wilson coefficients associated with effective operators up to arbitrary mass dimension, which emerge after integrating out heavy scalars and fermions from a generic UV theory. The Heat-Kernel coefficients are functions of non-zero background `electric', `magnetic' fields, and Polyakov loops. A major application of our formalism is the calculation of the finite temperature Coleman-Weinberg potentials in effective theories, necessary for the study of phase transitions. A novel feature of this work is the systematic calculation of the dependence of Polyakov loops on the thermal factors of Heat-Kernel coefficients and the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We study the effect of Polyakov loop factors on phase transitions and comment on future directions in applications of the results derived in this work.

Abstract: This study presents an investigation of the isotropic superconductor Ti4Ir2O, focusing on its magnetic field vs. temperature phase diagram near and above the Pauli limit for superconductivity. The data exhibits characteristic features that align with the formation of a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, including a deviation of the upper critical field line from the standard WHH model upon approaching the Pauli limiting field and a phase transition line separating the ordinary low-field superconducting phase from an unusual high field superconducting state above the Pauli limit. We discuss why the upper critical field line in this isotropic superconductor can approach the Pauli limit, necessitating a particularly high orbital limit for superconductivity. The research also identifies peculiar features in the specific heat data set taken at 0.6 K, which may be an example of the segmentation of the FFLO phase with multiple q phases. The findings provide an explanation for the violation of the Pauli limit in this superconductor, adding a fully isotropic superconductor to the list of potential FFLO superconductors and providing new insights for contemporary theories of the FFLO state.

# Evidence for the novel type of orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in the bulk limit of 2H-NbSe2

Abstract: The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, an unusual superconducting state, defies high magnetic fields beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. It exhibits a spatial modulation of the superconducting order parameter in real space and is exceptionally rare. Recently, an even more exotic variant - the orbital FFLO state - was predicted and identified in the transition metal dichalcogenide superconductor 2H-NbSe2. This state emerges in thin samples with thicknesses below ~40 nm, at the boundary between two and three dimensions. The complex interplay between Ising spin orbit coupling and the Pauli paramagnetic effect can lead to a stabilization of the FFLO state in a relatively large range of the magnetic phase diagram, even well below the Pauli limit. In this study, we present experimental evidence of the formation of this orbital FFLO state in bulk 2H-NbSe2 samples. This evidence was obtained using high-resolution DC magnetization and magnetic torque experiments in magnetic fields applied strictly parallel to the NbSe2 basal plane. Both quantities display a crossover to a discontinuous first-order superconducting transition at the normal state boundary in magnetic fields of 4 T and above. This is usually seen as a sign that Pauli paramagnetic pair breaking effects affect the superconducting state. The magnetic torque reveals a small step-like reversible anomaly, indicating a magnetic field-induced thermodynamic phase transition within the superconducting state. This anomaly bears many similarities to the FFLO transitions in other FFLO superconductors, suggesting the potential existence of an orbital FFLO state in bulk 2H-NbSe2 samples. Additionally, we observe a pronounced in-plane 6-fold symmetry of the upper critical field in the field range above this phase transition, which has previously been interpreted as a hallmark of the orbital FFLO state in thin 2H-NbSe2.

Abstract: Motivated by recent advancements in theoretical and experimental studies of the high-energy excitations on an antiferromagnetic trimer chain, we numerically investigate the quantum phase transition and composite dynamics in this system by applying a magnetic field. The numerical methods we used include the exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, time-dependent variational principle, and cluster perturbation theory. From calculating the entanglement entropy, we have revealed the phase diagram which includes the XY-I, $1/3$ magnetization plateau, XY-II, and ferromagnetic phases. Both the critical XY-I and XY-II phases are characterized by the conformal field theory with a central charge $c \simeq 1$. By analyzing the dynamic spin structure factor, we elucidate the distinct features of spin dynamics across different phases. In the regime with weak intertrimer interaction, we identify the intermediate-energy and high-energy modes in the XY-I and $1/3$ magnetization plateau phases as internal trimer excitations, corresponding to the propagating of doublons and quartons, respectively. Notably, applying a magnetic field splits the high-energy spectrum into two branches, labeled as the upper quarton and lower quarton. Furthermore, we explore the spin dynamics of a frustrated trimerized model closely related to the quantum magnet \ce{Na_2Cu_3Ge_4O_12}. In the end, we extend our discuss on the possibility of the quarton Bose-Einstein condensation in the trimer systems. Our results are expected to be further verified through the inelastic neutron scattering and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and also provide valuable insights for exploring high-energy exotic excitations.

Abstract: We study classical spin ice under uniaxial strain along the $[111]$ crystallographic axis. Remarkably, such strain preserves the extensive ice degeneracy and the corresponding classical Coulomb phase. The emergent monopole excitations remain thermodynamically deconfined exactly as in the isotropic case. However, their motion under local heat bath dynamics depends qualitatively on the sign of the strain. In the low-temperature limit for negative strain, the monopoles diffuse, while for positive strain, they localize. Introducing additional ring exchange dynamics into the ice background transforms the localized monopoles into sub-dimensional excitations whose motion is restricted to diffusion in the $(111)$-plane. The phenomena we identify are experimentally accessible in rare-earth pyrochlores under uniaxial pressure as well as in tripod kagome materials. The diffusive versus localized nature of the monopoles manifests in characteristic magnetic noise spectra, which we compute.

Abstract: A spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with a chirality-chirality interaction (CCI) on a two-leg ladder provides a minimal setup to explore an interplay between spin and chirality degrees of freedom. This model is potentially relevant for understanding the effects of a four-spin ring exchange and a phonon-mediated interaction on a ladder. By applying the Abelian bosonization and two types of spin-chirality duality, we derive a comprehensive ground-state phase diagram that includes previously unexplored cases of a ferromagnetic rung exchange $J_\perp<0$ or a negative CCI $K_{\rm ch}<0$. The phase diagram consists of the rung singlet (RS) phase, the Haldane phase, and three non-magnetic ordered phases. Moreover, the RS and Haldane phases consist of several regions with different dominant correlations in terms of spin, dimer, or chirality. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase structure and critical properties.

Abstract: Magnetoelectric (ME) materials displaying strong magnetically induced polarization have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and various fast electrically controlled magnetic devices. CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ (CMO) stands out for its giant spin-induced ferroelectric polarization. However, the origin of the induced electric polarization in CMO remains highly controversial and continues to be a subject of ongoing debate. In this paper, through room temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and thermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) measurements, we provide experimental evidence for a route to tune the magnetically induced polarization by modifying the exchange-striction in CMO via Sr-doping. Our findings demonstrate that the large and broad current peaks observed near the first magnetic phase transition ($T_N1 \sim 90$ K) indicate contributions to the TSDC density from both extrinsic thermally stimulated depolarization processes and intrinsic pyroelectric current arising from magnetically induced polarization changes. We suggest that this reduction in induced electric polarization in CMO originates from the increase in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- O -- Mn$^{4+}$ bond angle due to Sr$^{2+}$ doping, weakening the exchange-striction interaction. Meanwhile, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) effect determines the direction of the induced electric polarization. Our result sheds light on understanding the intriguing giant-induced polarization in CMO and similar compounds with complex magnetic structures.

Abstract: We investigate the ground state of a spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet at the 1/9 magnetization plateau, focusing primarily on six types of valence bond crystal (VBC) distortions. Among six types of VBC distortions, type 1 consistently exhibits the lowest ground-state energy. Analysis of the second derivative of the energy with respect to the distortion strength $J_{\rm d}$ using exact diagonalization reveals that, as the system size approaches the thermodynamic limit, the type 1 VBC state remains stable down to $J_{\rm d} = 1$, corresponding to the undistorted kagome lattice. Perturbation theory further supports the stability of the type 1 VBC state, providing energy values that agree with exact diagonalization results within 3%. We also explore the possibility that other types of VBC distortions could become the ground state, but type 1 VBC still exhibited the lowest energy. These findings suggest that the ground state of the 1/9 plateau in the kagome lattice is the type 1 VBC state.

Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.

Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.

Abstract: Understanding the complex ground state of van der Waals (vdW) magnets is essential for designing new materials and devices that leverage these platforms. Here, we investigate a two-dimensional vdW ferromagnet -- Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$-- with one of the highest reported Curie temperatures, to elucidate its magnetic excitations and charge order. Using Fe $L_3 - $edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we find the dual character of magnetic excitations, consisting of a coherent magnon and a continuum, similar to what is reported for its sister compound Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The magnon has an energy of $\approx$ 36 meV at the maximum in-plane momentum transfer ($-$0.35 r.l.u.) allowed at Fe $L_3 - $edge. A broad and non-dispersive continuum extends up to 150 meV, 50$\%$ higher energy than in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. Its intensity is sinusoidally modulated along the $L$ direction, with a period matching the inter-slab distance. Our findings suggest that while the unconventional dual character of magnetic excitations is generic to ternary Fe-Ge-Te vdW magnets, the correlation length of the out-of-plane magnetic interaction increases in Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ as compared to Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, supporting a stronger three-dimensional character for the former. Furthermore, by investigating the $\pm$(1/3, 1/3, $L$) peaks by resonant x-ray diffraction, we conclude these to have structural origin rather than charge order -- as previously reported -- and suggest doubling of the structural unit cell along the $c-$axis.

arXiv:2409.19249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum information science and sensing, electron spins are often purified into a specific polarisation through an optical-spin interface, a process known as optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Diamond-NV centres and transition metals are both excellent platforms for these so-called colour centres, while metal-free molecular analogues are also gaining popularity for their extended polarisation lifetimes, milder environmental impacts, and reduced costs. In our earlier attempt at designing such organic high-spin $\pi$-diradicals, we proposed to spin-polarise by shelving triplet $M_{S}=\pm1$ populations as singlets. This was recently verified by experiments albeit with low ODMR contrasts of $<1\%$ at temperatures above 5 K. In this work, we propose to improve the ODMR signal by moving singlet populations back into the triplet $M_{S}=0$ sublevel, designing a true carbon-based molecular analogue to the NV centre. Our proposal is based upon transition-orbital and group-theoretical analyses of beyond-nearest-neighbour spin-orbit couplings, which are further confirmed by ab initio calculations of a realistic trityl-based radical dimer. Microkinetic analyses point towards high ODMR contrasts of around $30\%$ under experimentally-feasible conditions, a stark improvement from previous works. Finally, in our quest towards ground-state optically-addressable molecular spin qubits, we exemplify how our symmetry-based design avoids Zeeman-induced singlet-triplet mixings, setting the scene for realising electron spin qubit gates.

Abstract: The real world obeys quantum physics and quantum computing presents an alternative way to map physical problems to systems that follow the same laws. Such computation fundamentally constitutes a better way to understand the most challenging quantum problems. One such problem is the accurate simulation of highly correlated quantum systems. Due to the high dimensionality of the problem classical computers require considerable computer power to accurately predict material properties, especially when strong electron interactions are present. Still, modern day quantum hardware has many limitations and only allows for modeling of very simple systems. Here we present for the first time a quantum computer model simulation of a complex hemocyanin molecule, which is an important respiratory protein involved in various physiological processes such as oxygen transport and immune defence, and is also used as a key component in therapeutic vaccines for cancer. To better characterise the mechanism by which hemocyanin transports oxygen, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on fermionic excitations and quantum embedding methods is used in the context of dynamic mean field theory to solve Anderson impurity model (AIM). Finally, it is concluded that the magnetic structure of hemocyanin is largely influenced by the many-body correction and that the computational effort for solving correlated electron systems could be substantially reduced with the introduction of quantum computing algorithms. We encourage the use of the Hamiltonian systems presented in this paper as a benchmark for testing quantum computing algorithms efficiency for chemistry applications.

Abstract: Floquet systems are periodically driven systems. In this framework, the system Hamiltonian and associated spectra of interest are modified, giving rise to new quantum phases of matter and nonequilibrium dynamics without static counterparts. Here we experimentally demonstrate a self-induced Floquet system in the interacting Rydberg gas. This originates from the photoionization of thermal Rydberg gases in a static magnetic field. Importantly, by leveraging the Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency spectrum, we probe the nonequilibrium dynamics in the bistable regime and identify the emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase. Our work fills the experimental gap in the understanding the relation of multistability and dissipative discrete time crystalline phase. In this regard, it constitutes a highly controlled platform for exploring exotic nonequilibrium physics in dissipative interacting systems.

Abstract: The evolution of the lunar magnetic field can reveal the Moon's interior structure, thermal history, and surface environment. The mid-to-late stage evolution of the lunar magnetic field is poorly constrained, and thus the existence of a long-lived lunar dynamo remains controversial. The Chang'e-5 mission returned the heretofore youngest mare basalts from Oceanus Procellarum uniquely positioned at mid-latitude. We recovered weak paleointensities of 2-4 uT from the Chang'e-5 basalt clasts at 2 billion years ago, attestting to the longevity of a lunar dynamo until at least the Moon's midlife. This paleomagnetic result implies the existence of thermal convection in the lunar deep interior at the lunar mid-stage which may have supplied mantle heat flux for the young volcanism.

arXiv:2411.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a phase-space electronic structure theory of molecules in magnetic fields. For a system of electrons in a magnetic field with vector potential $\bf{A}(\hat{\bf{r}})$, the usual Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian is the sum of the nuclear kinetic energy and the electronic Hamiltonian, $\frac{(\bf{P} - q\bf{A}(\bf{X}) )^2}{2M} + \hat{H}_{e}(\bf{X})$ (where $q$ is a nuclear charge). To include the effects of coupled nuclear-electron motion in the presence of magnetic field, we propose that the proper phase-space electronic structure Hamiltonian will be of the form $\frac{(\bf{P} - q^{\textit{eff}}\bf{A}(\bf{X}) - e\hat{\bf{\Gamma}})^2}{2M} + \hat{H}_{e}(\bf{X})$. Here, $q^{\textit{eff}}$ represents the {\em screened} nuclear charges and the $\hat{\bf{\Gamma}}$ term captures the local pseudomomentum of the electrons. This form reproduces exactly the energy levels for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field; moreover, single-surface dynamics along the eigenstates is guaranteed to conserve both the total pseudomomentum as well as the total angular momentum in the direction of the magnetic field. This Hamiltonian form can be immediately implemented within modern electronic structure packages (where the electronic orbitals will now depend on nuclear position ($\bf{X}$) and nuclear momentum ($\bf{P}$)). One can expect to find novel beyond Born-Oppenheimer magnetic field effects for strong enough fields and/or nonadiabatic systems.

Abstract: In a companion paper, we have developed a phase-space electronic structure theory of molecules in magnetic fields, whereby the electronic energy levels arise from diagonalizing a phase-space Hamiltonian $\hat H_{PS}(\bf{X},\bf{\Pi})$ that depends parametrically on nuclear position and momentum. The resulting eigenvalues are translationally invariant; moreover, if the magnetic field is in the $z-$direction, then the eigenvalues are also invariant to rotations around the $z-$direction. However, like all Hamiltonians in a magnetic field, the theory has a gauge degree of freedom (corresponding to the position of the magnetic origin in the vector potential), and requires either $(i)$ formally, a complete set of electronic states or $(ii)$ in practice, gauge invariant atomic orbitals (GIAOs) in order to realize such translational and rotational invariance. Here we describe how to implement a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian using GIAOs within a practical electronic structure package (in our case, Q-Chem). We further show that novel phenomena can be observed with finite $\bf{B}-$fields, including minimum energy structures with $\bf{\Pi}_{min} \ne 0$, indicating non-zero electronic motion in the ground-state.

Abstract: Spin masers with optical detection and artificial feedback are widely used in fundamental and practical applications. However, a full picture of the maser dynamics is still absent. By solving the feedback driven Bloch equations, we simulated the dynamics of an ideal spin maser in a broad parameter space. Rich nonlinear dynamics including high order harmonics generation, nonperiodic spin oscillations and frequency comb were revealed when the artificial feedback interaction exceeds the normal spin-field interaction. We also propose a pulse feedback spin maser protocol, which constructs an ultralow field magnetic frequency comb and could be useful in precision atomic magnetometers in searching for spin-dependent exotic interactions.

# Generating optical angular momentum through wavefront curvature

## 通过波前曲率产生光学角动量

arXiv:2411.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the understanding of optical angular momentum have resulted in many demonstrations of unusual optical phenomena, such as optical beams with orbital angular momentum and transverse spinning light. Here we detail novel contributions to spin and orbital angular momentum generated by the gradient of wavefront curvature that becomes relevant in strongly focused beams of light. While circularly polarized beams are shown to develop helicity-dependent transverse spin, a linearly polarized Gaussian beam produces longitudinal spin and orbital angular momenta in the focal region, even if lacking both of these before focusing. Analytical treatment of a nonparaxial electromagnetic field, validated with vectorial diffraction modelling, shows that the terms related to higher orders of a paraxial parameter are responsible for the appearance of non-trivial angular momenta. The obtained dependences relate these quantities to the gradient of the wavefront curvature, showing how it can be used as a novel degree of freedom for applications in optical manipulation and light-matter interactions at subwavelength scales, enabling angular momentum transfer even from a simple Gaussian beam with linear polarization.

# Evidence of potential thermospheric overcooling during the May 2024 geomagnetic superstorm

## 2024年5月地磁超级风暴期间潜在热层过冷的证据

Abstract: During intense geomagnetic storms, the rapid and significant production of NO followed by its associated infrared radiative emission in lower thermosphere contributes crucially to the energetics of the upper atmosphere. This makes NO infrared radiative cooling a very important phenomenon which needs to be considered for accurate density forecasting in thermosphere. This study reports the investigation of variations in thermospheric density, and NO radiative cooling during the recent geomagnetic superstorm of May 2024. A very rare post-storm thermospheric density depletion of about -23% on May 12 was observed by Swarm-C in northern hemisphere in comparison to the prestorm condition on May 9. This overcooling was observed despite the continuous enhancement in solar EUV (24-36 nm) flux throughout the event. The thermospheric NO infrared radiative emission in the recovery phase of the storm seems to be the plausible cause for this observed post-storm density depletion. The TIMED/SABER observed thermospheric density between 105 and 110 km altitude shows an enhancement during this thermospheric overcooling. Our analysis also suggests an all time high thermospheric NO radiative cooling flux up to 11.84 ergs/cm2/sec during May 2024 geomagnetic superstorm, which has also been compared with famous Halloween storms of October 2003.

# Enhanced Collisional Losses from a Magnetic Mirror Using the Lenard-Bernstein Collision Operator

## 使用lenard-bernstein碰撞算子增强磁镜的碰撞损耗

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14294

arXiv:2411.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions play a crucial role in governing particle and energy transport in plasmas confined in a magnetic mirror trap. Modern gyrokinetic codes are used to model transport in magnetic mirrors, but some of these codes utilize approximate model collision operators. This study focuses on a Pastukhov-style method of images calculation of particle and energy confinement times using a Lenard-Bernstein model collision operator. Prior work on parallel particle and energy balances used a different Fokker-Planck plasma collision operator and the method needs to be extended in non-trivial ways to study the Lenard-Bernstein operator. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we compare our results with a modern finite element solver. Our findings reveal that the particle confinement time scales like $a \exp(a^2)$ using the Lenard-Bernstein operator, in contrast to the more accurate scaling that the Coulomb collision operator would yield $a^2 \exp(a^2)$, where $a^2$ is approximately proportional to the ambipolar potential. We propose that codes modeling collisional losses in a magnetic mirrors utilizing the Lenard-Bernstein or Dougherty collision operator scale their collision frequency of any electrostatically confined species. This study illuminates the intricate role the collision operator plays in the Pastukhov-style method of images calculation of collisional confinement.

Abstract: An inter-combination transition in Yb enables a novel approach for rapidly imaging magnetic field variations with excellent spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy. This quantum imaging magnetometer reveals "dark stripes" that are contours of constant magnetic field visible by eye or capturable by standard cameras. These dark lines result from a combination of Autler-Townes splitting and the spatial Hanle effect in the $^{1}S_{0} - ^{3}P_{1}$ transition of Yb when driven by multiple strong coherent laser fields (carrier and AM/FM modulation sidebands of a single-mode 556 nm laser). We show good agreement between experimental data and our theoretical model for the closed, 4-level Zeeman shifted V-system and demonstrate scalar and vector magnetic fields measurements at video frame rates over spatial dimensions of 5 cm (expandable to $>$ 1 m) with 0.1 mm resolution. Additionally, the $^{1}S_{0} - ^{3}P_{1}$ transition allows for $\sim\mu$s response time and a large dynamic range ($\mu$T to many Ts).

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive comparison of linear amplifiers and microwave photon-counters in axion dark matter experiments. The study is done assuming a range of realistic operating conditions and detector parameters, over the frequency range between 1--30 GHz. As expected, photon counters are found to be advantageous under low background, at high frequencies ($\nu>$ 5 GHz), {\em if} they can be implemented with robust wide-frequency tuning or a very low dark count rate. Additional noteworthy observations emerging from this study include: (1) an expanded applicability of off-resonance photon background reduction, including the single-quadrature state squeezing, for scan rate enhancements; (2) a much broader appeal for operating the haloscope resonators in the over-coupling regime, up to $\beta\sim 10$; (3) the need for a detailed investigation into the cryogenic and electromagnetic conditions inside haloscope cavities to lower the photon temperature for future experiments; (4) the necessity to develop a distributed network of coupling ports in high-volume axion haloscopes to utilize these potential gains in the scan rate.

# Nonlinear internal waves breaking in stellar radiation zones. Parametrisation for the transport of angular momentum: bridging geophysical to stellar fluid dynamics

## 恒星辐射区的非线性内波破裂。角动量传输的参数化: 将地球物理与恒星流体动力学联系起来

arXiv:2411.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internal gravity waves (hereafter IGWs) are one of the mechanisms that can play a key role to redistribute efficiently angular momentum in stars along their evolution. The study of IGWs is thus of major importance since space-based asteroseismology reveals a transport of angular momentum in stars, which is stronger by two orders of magnitude than the one predicted by stellar models ignoring their action or those of magnetic fields. IGWs trigger angular momentum transport when they are damped by heat or viscous diffusion, when they meet a critical layer or when they break. Theoretical prescriptions have been derived for the transport of angular momentum induced by IGWs because of their radiative and viscous dampings and of the critical layers they encounter along their propagation. However, none has been proposed for the transport triggered by their nonlinear breaking. In this work, we aim to derive such a physical and robust prescription, which can be implemented in stellar structure and evolution codes. We adapt an analytical saturation model, which has been developed for IGWs nonlinear convective breaking in the Earth atmosphere and has been successfully compared to in-situ measurements in the stratosphere, to the case of deep spherical stellar interiors. In a first step, we neglect the modification of IGWs by the Coriolis acceleration and the Lorentz force, which are discussed and taken into account in a second step. We derive a complete semi-analytical prescription for the transport of angular momentum by IGWs, which takes into account both their radiative damping and their potential nonlinear breaking because of their convective and vertical shear instabilities. This allows us to bring the physical prescription for the interactions between IGWs and the differential rotation to the same level of realism that the one used in global circulation models for the atmosphere.

# Photon drag at the junction between metal and 2d semiconductor

## 金属与2d半导体交界处的光子阻力

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14075

arXiv:2411.14075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon drag represents a mechanism of photocurrent generation wherein the electromagnetic (EM) field momentum is transferred directly to the charge carriers. It is believed to be small by the virtue of low photon momentum compared to the typical momenta of the charge carriers. Here, we show that photon drag becomes particularly strong at the junctions between metals and 2d materials, wherein highly non-uniform local EM fields are generated upon diffraction. To this end, we combine an exact theory of diffraction at 'metal-2d material' junctions with microscopic transport theory of photon drag, and derive the functional dependences of the respective photovoltage on the parameters of EM field and 2d system. The voltage responsivity appears inversely proportional to the electromagnetic frequency $\omega$, the sheet density of charge, and a dimensionless momentum transfer coefficient $\alpha$ which depends only on 2d conductivity in units of light speed $\eta = 2\pi \sigma/c$ and light polarization. For $p$-polarized incident light, the momentum transfer coefficient appears finite even for vanishingly small 2d conductivity $\eta$, which is a consequence of dynamic lightning rod effect. For $s$-polarized incident light, the momentum transfer coefficient scales as $\eta \ln \eta^{-1}$, which stems from long-range dipole radiation of a linear junction. A simple estimate shows that the ratio of thermoelectric and photon drag photovoltages at the junction for $p$-polarization is roughly $\omega\tau_\varepsilon$, where $\tau_\varepsilon$ is the energy relaxation time, while for $s$-polarization the photon drag always dominates over the thermoelectric effect.

# Enhancing the ODMR Signal of Organic Molecular Qubits

## 增强有机分子量子比特的ODMR信号

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19249

arXiv:2409.19249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum information science and sensing, electron spins are often purified into a specific polarisation through an optical-spin interface, a process known as optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Diamond-NV centres and transition metals are both excellent platforms for these so-called colour centres, while metal-free molecular analogues are also gaining popularity for their extended polarisation lifetimes, milder environmental impacts, and reduced costs. In our earlier attempt at designing such organic high-spin $\pi$-diradicals, we proposed to spin-polarise by shelving triplet $M_{S}=\pm1$ populations as singlets. This was recently verified by experiments albeit with low ODMR contrasts of $<1\%$ at temperatures above 5 K. In this work, we propose to improve the ODMR signal by moving singlet populations back into the triplet $M_{S}=0$ sublevel, designing a true carbon-based molecular analogue to the NV centre. Our proposal is based upon transition-orbital and group-theoretical analyses of beyond-nearest-neighbour spin-orbit couplings, which are further confirmed by ab initio calculations of a realistic trityl-based radical dimer. Microkinetic analyses point towards high ODMR contrasts of around $30\%$ under experimentally-feasible conditions, a stark improvement from previous works. Finally, in our quest towards ground-state optically-addressable molecular spin qubits, we exemplify how our symmetry-based design avoids Zeeman-induced singlet-triplet mixings, setting the scene for realising electron spin qubit gates.

# Kapitza-Inspired Stabilization of Non-Foster Circuits via Time Modulations

Abstract: With his formal analysis in 1951, the physicist Pyotr Kapitza demonstrated that an inverted pendulum with an externally vibrating base can be stable in its upper position, thus overcoming the force of gravity. Kapitza's work is an example that an originally unstable system can become stable after a minor perturbation of its properties or initial conditions is applied. Inspired by his ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the application of external \textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations. Non-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since their bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds. Unfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be stabilized prior to operation. Here, we focus on the study of non-Foster $L(t)C$ circuits with time-varying inductors and time-invariant negative capacitors. We find an intrinsic connection between Kapitza's inverted pendulum and non-Foster $L(t)C$ resonators. Moreover, we show how positive time-varying modulations of $L(t)>0$ can overcome and stabilize non-Foster negative capacitances $C<0$. These findings open up an alternative manner of stabilizing electric circuits with the use of time modulations, and lay the groundwork for application of, what we coin \textit{Vibrational Electromagnetics}, in more complex media.

# Cryogenic W-band Electron Spin Resonance Probehead with an Integral Cryogenic Low Noise Amplifier

arXiv:2410.15159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest to enhance the sensitivity of electron spin resonance (ESR) is an ongoing challenge. One potential strategy involves increasing the frequency, for instance, moving from Q-band (approximately 35 GHz) to W-band (approximately 94 GHz). However, this shift typically results in higher transmission and switching losses, as well as increased noise in signal amplifiers. In this work, we address these shortcomings by employing a W-band probehead integrated with a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a microresonator. This configuration allows us to position the LNA close to the resonator, thereby amplifying the acquired ESR signal with minimal losses. Furthermore, when operated at cryogenic temperatures, the LNA exhibits unparalleled noise levels that are significantly lower than those of conventional room temperature LNAs. We detail the novel probehead design and provide some experimental results at room temperature as well as cryogenic temperatures for representative paramagnetic samples. We find, for example, that spin sensitivity of ~3*10^5 spins/sqrt(Hz) is achieved for a sample of phosphorus doped 28Si, even for sub-optimal sample geometry with potential improvement to <10^3 spins/sqrt(Hz) in more optimal scenarios.

# Quantum phase transitions and composite excitations of antiferromagnetic spin trimer chains in a magnetic field

arXiv:2402.00272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advancements in theoretical and experimental studies of the high-energy excitations on an antiferromagnetic trimer chain, we numerically investigate the quantum phase transition and composite dynamics in this system by applying a magnetic field. The numerical methods we used include the exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, time-dependent variational principle, and cluster perturbation theory. From calculating the entanglement entropy, we have revealed the phase diagram which includes the XY-I, $1/3$ magnetization plateau, XY-II, and ferromagnetic phases. Both the critical XY-I and XY-II phases are characterized by the conformal field theory with a central charge $c \simeq 1$. By analyzing the dynamic spin structure factor, we elucidate the distinct features of spin dynamics across different phases. In the regime with weak intertrimer interaction, we identify the intermediate-energy and high-energy modes in the XY-I and $1/3$ magnetization plateau phases as internal trimer excitations, corresponding to the propagating of doublons and quartons, respectively. Notably, applying a magnetic field splits the high-energy spectrum into two branches, labeled as the upper quarton and lower quarton. Furthermore, we explore the spin dynamics of a frustrated trimerized model closely related to the quantum magnet \ce{Na_2Cu_3Ge_4O_12}. In the end, we extend our discuss on the possibility of the quarton Bose-Einstein condensation in the trimer systems. Our results are expected to be further verified through the inelastic neutron scattering and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and also provide valuable insights for exploring high-energy exotic excitations.

Abstract: Floquet systems are periodically driven systems. In this framework, the system Hamiltonian and associated spectra of interest are modified, giving rise to new quantum phases of matter and nonequilibrium dynamics without static counterparts. Here we experimentally demonstrate a self-induced Floquet system in the interacting Rydberg gas. This originates from the photoionization of thermal Rydberg gases in a static magnetic field. Importantly, by leveraging the Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency spectrum, we probe the nonequilibrium dynamics in the bistable regime and identify the emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase. Our work fills the experimental gap in the understanding the relation of multistability and dissipative discrete time crystalline phase. In this regard, it constitutes a highly controlled platform for exploring exotic nonequilibrium physics in dissipative interacting systems.

# A Spectrochemical Series for Electron Spin Relaxation

## 电子自旋弛豫的光谱化学系列

Controlling the rate of electron spin relaxation in paramagnetic molecules is essential for contemporary applications in molecular magnetism and quantum information science. However, the physical mechanisms of spin relaxation remain incompletely understood, and new spectroscopic observables play an important role in evaluating spin dynamics mechanisms and structure-property relationships. Here, we use cryogenic magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in tandem to examine the impact of ligand field (d-d) excited states on spin relaxation rates. We employ a broad scope of square-planar Cu(II) compounds with varying ligand field strength, including CuS4, CuN4, CuN2O2, and CuO4 first coordination spheres. An unexpectedly strong correlation exists between spin relaxation rates and the average d-d energy (R2 = 0.97). The relaxation rate trends as the inverse eleventh power of the excited-state energies, whereas simplified theoretical models predict only an inverse second power dependence. These experimental results directly implicate ligand field excited states as playing a critical role in the ground state spin relaxation mechanism. Furthermore, ligand field strength is revealed to be a particularly powerful design principle for spin dynamics, enabling formation of a spectrochemical series for spin relaxation.

# Study of the Mechanical Recycling Process of Electric Motors for the Recovery and Valorization of NdFeB Magnet Content

## 研究电动机的机械回收过程，以回收和提高NdFeB磁体含量

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-x3sh7?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

The demand for NdFeB permanent magnets, known as the strongest permanent magnets on the market, is projected to rise significantly. These magnets, made from rare earth elements (REEs) such as neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), and dysprosium (Dy), are essential for various high-tech applications, including electric motors for e-mobility, wind turbines, electronics, and air conditioners. However, their production is heavily reliant on REEs—classified as critical raw materials in the EU due to limited geographic availability and supply risks. Over 60% of global REE production occurs in China, which also controls 91% of REEs refinement and 94% of the permanent magnet market. Given Europe’s lack of internal REEs production and refining capabilities, this dependency on Chinese imports poses a supply risk. To address this problem, Europe must establish alternative REE sources, either by exploiting local mines or implementing recycling. Projections indicate that by 2050, recycling could potentially meet up to 75% of Europe’s REE demand. However, current recycling efforts are limited, with less than 1% of REEs being recovered. This study aims to investigate a recycling method capable of recovering REEs, particularly from NdFeB magnets embedded within electric motors from e-mobility. The focus centers on a mechanical pretreatment approach that combines shredding with physical separation techniques, such as magnetic separation. The primary objective is to isolate a NdFeB-enriched fraction—a material stream containing a substantially higher concentration of NdFeB magnets than the original motor composition. An industrial-scale trial was conducted on electric motors that were initially thermally demagnetized. This demagnetization step is crucial to mitigate issues related to magnet agglomeration during subsequent mechanical processing. The demagnetized motors were then shredded and processed via magnetic separation within an industrial facility. The separated fractions were subjected to laboratory pretreatment, involving sample homogenization, sieving, and magnetic attraction, to concentrate the NdFeB content. The samples were analyzed through MP-AES to quantify the REE content, including Nd, Pr, Ce, Dy, and Gd. This data provided insights into the enrichment of NdFeB magnets in the treated fraction. A material flow analysis (MFA) was conducted to assess the distribution of magnets throughout the process. The MFA revealed that 71.3% of magnets entering the treatment facility were retained in the ferrous fraction, while 28.3% were found in the non-ferrous fraction. The ferromagnetic properties of the NdFeB magnets facilitated their attraction to the magnetic separator, enhancing the concentration of magnets in the ferrous fraction. A significant increase was observed in the magnet concentration in the non-ferrous fraction after additional magnetic separation, with the concentration rising from 9.47% in the initial non-ferrous fraction to 50.8% in the final attracted fraction. The findings of the study provided key information for the future design of an optimized mechanical pretreatment process that could achieve both a higher concentration of NdFeB magnets and an improved process yield.

# Study of the Thermal Demagnetization Process of NdFeB Magnets

## 钕铁硼磁体热退磁过程的研究

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-k6rkk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Currently, less than 1% of rare earth elements (REEs) are recycled due to the limitations of conventional recycling methods. Waste streams containing NdFeB magnets, such as household appliances, industrial motors, electric vehicle (EV) motors, and consumer electronics, are typically processed using traditional recycling techniques. These methods often involve shredding the material and applying separation techniques like magnetic and eddy current separation, which are designed to recover materials such as copper, iron, aluminum, plastic, and precious metals. However, they do not effectively recover REEs. Studies have shown that the ferrous fraction from typical recycling facilities for ferrous waste contains a REEs concentration which is too low to be economically viable for REE recovery. This creates a pressing need of designing recycling processes able to valorize the REEs fraction. A critical step in these processes is the demagnetization of NdFeB magnets, without which their efficient separation from the waste stream would not be feasible. Demagnetization is necessary when processing waste through mechanical shredding and separation to prevent the strong magnetism of NdFeB magnets from causing operational issues. Issues such as the formation of “meatballs” (clusters of magnetic material) and magnets sticking to ferromagnetic parts of machinery are common when magnets remain magnetized. Moreover, demagnetization facilitates the separation of magnets from non-ferromagnetic fractions in the waste stream. Demagnetization can be achieved using different techniques. One approach is hydrogen decrepitation, where hydrogen is absorbed by the NdFeB magnet, leading to brittle hydride formation that breaks down the magnet into a fine powder, which simultaneously induces demagnetization. Alternatively, thermal treatment can be used to raise the temperature of the magnets above their Curie temperature, at which point they lose their magnetic properties. This study focused on the thermal demagnetization of NdFeB magnets contained within electric motors. Using an experimental design approach, we developed demagnetization curves that correlate the degree of demagnetization with key parameters such as temperature and treatment duration. The study also examined potential differences in demagnetization behavior when magnets were treated as part of an assembled motor versus individually. NdFeB magnets were subjected to varying temperatures and time intervals to generate these demagnetization curves, providing insights into the behavior of both individual magnets and those integrated within motor assemblies. Notably, it was observed that the average degree of demagnetization achieved varied depending on whether magnets were treated within the rotor or individually. This suggests that the assembly within the rotor affects the demagnetization response, resulting in a slower demagnetization process. The experimental design (DOE) method enabled the development of a predictive model that estimates the degree of demagnetization based on time and temperature parameters. Results indicated that the coefficient for temperature (T) in the model consistently exerted a stronger influence on demagnetization than the coefficient for time (t), suggesting that temperature has a greater impact on demagnetization process.
