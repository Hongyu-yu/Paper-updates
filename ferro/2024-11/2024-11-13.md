Experiments suggest an enhancement of the strength function at low energy, but this enhancement has not been reproduced in models of heavy nuclei as conventional shell-model methods become computationally intractable. Using shell-model Monte Carlo methods, the authors have successfully reproduced the low-energy enhancement (LEE) for magnetic dipole transitions in neodymium isotopes, while also illuminating the role of the scissors and spin-flip modes in these <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>M</mi><mn>1</mn></mrow></math> transitions.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological Hall-like (THE-like) signals in disordered multidomain ferromagnets. Non-monotonic behavior in Hall resistivity, commonly attributed to topological spin textures such as skyrmions, is produced in a random resistor network model without any chirality. It arises from simple mechanisms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in combination with the domain wall scattering. By varying domain configurations and domain wall resistances, we explore the conditions under which the non-monotonic resistivity can be enhanced. Our results emphasize the need for careful analysis in distinguishing between true topological Hall effects and artifacts caused by domain disorders.

# The extended Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice

## 蜂窝晶格上的扩展Hubbard模型

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07429

arXiv:2411.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of both nesting and a van Hove singularity at half filling, together with the presence of Dirac cones makes the honeycomb lattice a special laboratory to explore strongly correlated phenomena. For instance, at zero temperature the repulsive [attractive] Hubbard model only undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic [$s$-wave superconducting degenerate with charge density wave (SC-CDW)] for sufficiently strong on-site coupling, $U/t\gtrsim 3.85$ [$U/t\lesssim -3.85$]; in between these, the system is a semi-metal, by virtue of the Dirac cones. The addition of an additional interaction, $V>0$ or $V<0$, between fermions in nearest neighbor orbitals should break the SC-CDW degeneracy giving rise to a phase diagram quite distinct from the one for the square lattice. Here we perform determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the whole phase diagram, covering the four combinations of signs of $U$ and $V$; the use of complex Hubbard-Stratonovich fields renders the region $|V|\leq |U|/3$ free from the `minus sign problem'. We calculate structure factors associated with different orderings, which, together with the double occupancy and the average sign allows us to map out the whole phase diagram. We have found that the SM phase forms a zone from which ordered phases are excluded, preventing the stabilization of a $d$-wave SC phase, i.e., only $s$-wave pairing is allowed.

arXiv:2411.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-induced phase transitions offer a method to dynamically modulate topological states in bulk complex materials. Yet, next-generation devices demand nanoscale architectures with contact resistances near the quantum limit and precise control over local electronic properties. The layered material WTe$_2$ has gained attention as a likely Weyl semimetal, with topologically protected linear electronic band crossings hosting massless chiral fermions. Here, we demonstrate a topological phase transition facilitated by light-induced shear motion of a single atomic layer at the surface of bulk WTe$_2$, thereby opening the door to nanoscale device concepts. Ultrafast terahertz fields enhanced at the apex of an atomically sharp tip resonantly couple to the key interlayer shear mode of WTe$_2$ via a ferroelectric dipole at the interface, inducing a structural phase transition at the surface to a metastable state. Subatomically resolved differential imaging, combined with hybrid-level density functional theory, reveals a shift of 7 $\pm$ 3 picometres in the top atomic plane. Tunnelling spectroscopy links electronic changes across the phase transition with the electron and hole pockets in the band structure, suggesting a reversible, light-induced annihilation of the topologically-protected Fermi arc surface states in the top atomic layer.

arXiv:2411.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize ferromagnetic semiconductors with high Curie temperature TC is still a challenge in spintronics. Recent experiments have obtained two-dimensional (2D) room temperature ferromagnetic metals, such as monolayers MnSe2 and Cr3Te6. In this paper, by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we proposed a way to obtain 2D high TC ferromagnetic semiconductors through element replacement in these ferromagnetic metals. High TC ferromagnetic semiconductors are predicted in the monolayers (Mn, D)Se2 and (Cr, D)3Te6, where element D is taken as vacancy, 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal elements. For the concentrations of D from 1/9 to 1/3, there are about 10 ferromagnetic semiconductors with TC above 200 K, including (Cr5/6, W1/6)3Te6 and (Cr4/6, Mo2/6)3Te6 with TC above 300 K. In addition, Mn(Se6/8, Sb2/8)2 is also predicted to be a 2D ferromagnetic semiconductor with TC above 300 K. Considering the fast developments on fabrication and manipulation of 2D materials, our theoretical results propose a way to explore the high temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors from experimentally obtained 2D high temperature ferromagnetic metals through element replacement approach.

arXiv:2411.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-spin coupling is an attractive phenomenon from the standpoints of fundamental physics and device applications, and has spurred rapid development recently. Whereas the current efforts are devoted to trivial magnetism, the interplay between light and nontrivial spin properties of topological magnetism is little known. Here, using first principles, rt-TDDFT and atomic spin simulations, we explore the evaluation of topological spin properties of monolayer CrInSe3 under laser, establishing the ultrafast ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic skyrmion reversal. The physics correlates to the laser-induced significant spin-selective charge transfer, demagnetization, and time-dependent magnetic interactions. Especially, an essential switching from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic exchange is generated under light irradiation. More importantly, dynamics of topological magnetic physics shows that this process accompanies with the evaluation of topological magnetism from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic skyrmions, manifesting intriguing interplay between light and topological spin properties. Our letter provides a novel approach toward the highly desired ultrafast control of topological magnetism.

# Periodic phase diagrams in micromagnetics with an eigenvalue solver

## 具有特征值求解器的微磁学中的周期性相图

arXiv:2411.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach to compute periodic phase diagram of micromagnetic systems by solving a periodic linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation using an eigenvalue solver with the Finite Element Method formalism. The linear operator in the eigenvalue problem is defined as a function of the periodic phase shift wave vector. The dispersion diagrams are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for complex eigen frequencies and corresponding eigen states for a range of prescribed wave vectors. The presented approach incorporates a calculation of the periodic effective field, including the exchange and magnetostatic field components. The approach is general in that it allows handling 3D problems with any 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities. The ability to calculated periodic diagrams provides insights into the spin wave propagation and localized resonances in complex micromagnetic structures.

# Spin entanglement in antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07637

arXiv:2411.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin entanglement in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with antiferromagnetic atomic interactions using the Hartree-Fock approach. Based on the isomorphism between symmetric $N$-qubit states and spin-$j=N/2$ states, we analyze the negativity of the spin-1 ground state of the condensate viewed as a two spins $1/2$, and explore its dependence with the temperature and external Zeeman fields. The scope of this type of entanglement is highlighted and contrasted with other types of entanglement, as the mode and particle entanglement. It is shown that, at finite temperatures, there is a strong dependence of the negativity with respect to the strengths of quadratic Zeeman fields and the spin-spin interactions of the condensate. Interestingly, in the antiferromagnetic ground-state phase, the negativity and the linear Zeeman field are connected quadratically through the equation of a simple circle, in which its radius depends on the temperature. On the other hand, for the polar phase, being the phase that exhibits the highest degree of entanglement, we were able to identify a clear dependency on the spin-spin interactions and the Zeeman fields that can be expressed analytically in a closed form as a function of the temperature. This results might be relevant for applications in quantum information and metrology.

# Skin-topological effect in two-dimensional nonreciprocal topological superconductor

## 二维非互易拓扑超导体中的趋肤拓扑效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07657

arXiv:2411.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and topological properties in two-dimensional topological superconductor. Two kinds of non-Hermiticity are considered. The first is the spin-independent non-reciprocal hopping, which respects particle-hole symmetry (PHS) and dictates the bulk as well as topological edge modes localize at opposite corners, manifested as the $Z_2$ NHSE protected by PHS. The direction of the localization can be conveniently characterized by the sign of the winding numbers. The other is the spin-dependent non-reciprocal hopping, where the NHSE is protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS). The Kramers doublets are localized at opposite corners, namely the TRS protected $Z_2$ NHSE. When apply an external magnetic field, its internal symmetry changes from the symplectic class into the orthogonal class, eliminating the NHSE for the states in the spectrum continuum. For the zero energy states which are isolated, the NHSE still has its effects despite the orthogonality. For the spin-independent case, edge states can be effectively tuned by the direction of Zeeman field, where at certain directions the zero-energy edge state can be free of NHSE and uniformly distributed. Our work paves the way for the study of the interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity in superconducting systems.

Abstract: The silver fluoride Ag$_3$F$_5$ consists structurally of square-planar units formed by four fluoride ions coordinated to a central silver ion, which possesses a partially filled $d$-subshell and the formal valence of +5/3. In this study, we demonstrate that the previously published crystal structure of Ag$_3$F$_5$ is unstable due to the Jahn-Teller effect, arising from the presence of two energetically degenerate $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states sharing a single electron hole. Through a full structural relaxation within the DFT+U framework, we identified a new crystal structure for Ag$_3$F$_5$ with reduced symmetry and an energy gain of 151~meV per formula unit relative to the published structure. In this relaxed structure, magnetic chains are formed by silver ions with an electronic hole occupying the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. These results highlight the crucial role of electron correlation effects and related structural distortions in determining the properties of such materials.

Abstract: Charge-spin conversion phenomena such as the spin Hall effect allow for the excitation of magnons in a magnetic layer by passing an electric current in an adjacent nonmagnetic conductor. We demonstrate that this current-induced modification of the magnon density generates an additional nonlinear longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance for every magnetoresistance that depends on the magnetization. Using harmonic measurements, we evidence that these magnon creation-annihilation magnetoresistances dominate the second harmonic longitudinal and transverse resistance of thin Y$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$/Pt bilayers. Our results apply to both insulating and metallic magnetic layers, elucidating the dependence of the magnetoresistance on applied current and magnetic field for a broad variety of systems excited by spin currents.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive set of harmonic resistance measurements of the dampinglike (DL) and fieldlike (FL) torques in Pt/CoFeB, Pt/Co, W/CoFeB, W/Co, and YIG/Pt bilayers complemented by measurements of the DL torque using the magneto-optical Kerr effect and calibrated by nitrogen vacancy magnetometry on the same devices. The magnon creation-annihilation magnetoresistances depend strongly on temperature and on the magnetic and transport properties of each bilayer, affecting the estimate of both the DL and FL torque. The DL torque, the most important parameter for applications, is overestimated by a factor of 2 in W/CoFeB and by one order of magnitude in YIG/Pt when not accounting for the magnonic contribution to the planar Hall resistance. We further show that the magnonic contribution can be quantified by combining measurements of the nonlinear longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistances, thus providing a reliable method to measure the spin-orbit torques in different material systems.

After one particle starts to radiate, the emitted energy first reaches the other one with a delay according to electromagnetic retardation, and afterwards the flux shows oscillatory exponential relaxation to its stationary value. For the room or higher temperature radiation, the oscillation period and relaxation time are determined by the resonance frequency and damping rate of the particle polarizability, respectively, being equal to dozens of femtoseconds and one picosecond for silicon carbide particles. At cryogenic temperatures, the relaxation time depends on the thermal wavelength.

Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and charge density waves are observed in close vicinity in many strongly correlated materials. Increasing evidence from experiments and numerical simulations suggests both phenomena can also occur in an intertwined manner, where the superconducting order parameter is coupled to the electronic density. Employing density matrix renormalization group simulations, we investigate the nature of such an intertwined state of matter stabilized in the phase diagram of the elementary $t$-$t^\prime$-$U$ Hubbard model in the strong coupling regime. Remarkably, the condensate of Cooper pairs is shown to be fragmented in the presence of a charge density wave where more than one pairing wave function is macroscopically occupied. Moreover, we provide conclusive evidence that the macroscopic wave functions of the superconducting fragments are well-described by soliton solutions of a Ginzburg-Landau equation in a periodic potential constituted by the charge density wave. In the presence of an orbital magnetic field, the order parameters are gauge invariant, and superconducting vortices are pinned between the stripes. This intertwined Ginzburg-Landau theory is proposed as an effective low-energy description of the stripe fragmented superconductor.

Abstract: The spin point groups are finite groups whose elements act on both real space and spin space. Among these groups are the magnetic point groups in the case where the real and spin space operations are locked to one another. The magnetic point groups are central to magnetic crystallography for strong spin-orbit coupled systems and the spin point groups generalize these to the intermediate and weak spin-orbit coupled cases. The spin point groups were introduced in the 1960's in the context of condensed matter physics and enumerated shortly thereafter. In this paper, we complete the theory ofcrystallographic spin point groups by presenting an account of these groups and their representation theory. Our main findings are that the so-called nontrivial spin point groups (numbering $598$ groups) have co-irreps corresponding exactly to the (co-)-irreps of regular or black and white groups and we tabulate this correspondence for each nontrivial group. However a total spin group, comprising the product of a nontrivial group and a spin-only group, has new co-irreps in cases where there is continuous rotational freedom. We provide explicit co-irrep tables for all these instances. We also discuss new forms of spin-only group extending the Litvin-Opechowski classes. To exhibit the usefulness of these groups to physically relevant problems we discuss a number of examples from electronic band structures of altermagnets to magnons.

# "Quantum Geometric Nesting" and Solvable Model Flat-Band Systems

arXiv:2401.04163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "quantum geometric nesting'' (QGN) to characterize the idealized ordering tendencies of certain flat-band systems implicit in the geometric structure of the flat-band subspace. Perfect QGN implies the existence of an infinite class of local interactions that can be explicitly constructed and give rise to solvable ground states with various forms of possible fermion bi-linear order, including flavor ferromagnetism, density waves, and superconductivity. For the ideal Hamiltonians constructed in this way, we show that certain aspects of the low-energy spectrum can also be exactly computed including, in the superconducting case, the phase stiffness. Examples of perfect QGN include flat bands with certain symmetries (e.g. chiral or time-reversal), and non-symmetry-related cases exemplified with an engineered model for pair-density-wave. Extending this approach, we obtain exact superconducting ground states with nontrivial pairing symmetry.

Abstract: Recent theoretical work has shown that higher-order moments of the Berry curvature, e.g., Berry curvature quadrupole and hexapole moments, can produce the leading order nonlinear anomalous Hall response (NLAH) in systems with special magnetic point group symmetry. Recent experimental work has reported the observation of the Berry curvature quadrupole-induced third-order NLAH (i.e., Hall voltage proportional to the third power of the external electric field) from cryogenic conditions to room temperature in an epitaxially grown material platform with broken time-reversal symmetry. In this paper, using semiclassical Boltzmann formalism in the relaxation time approximation, we compute the Berry curvature quadrupole-induced nonlinear anomalous thermal Hall and Nernst coefficients in time-reversal broken systems. In systems where Berry curvature monopole and dipole moments vanish by symmetry, our results predict the behavior of the leading order anomalous thermal Hall and Nernst coefficients proportional to the third power of the applied longitudinal temperature gradient. They are guaranteed to exist in systems that have already exhibited the third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in recent experiments.

Abstract: Fu and Kane have taught us that a Majorana zero-mode appears on the quantum spin Hall edge at the interface with a superconductor. If a magnetic scatterer is placed on the edge, the zero-point energy of massless edge excitations exerts a force on the scatterer. This is the fermionic analogue of the electromagnetic Casimir effect. We show that the Majorana zero-mode produces a repulsive Casimir force, pushing the scatterer away from the superconductor. Unlike some other signatures of Majorana zero-modes, the repulsive Casimir force is directly tied to the topological invariant of the system (the sign of the determinant of the reflection matrix from the superconductor).

Abstract: Magnetic metal-organic frameworks (MMOFs), where magnetic metal nodes are connected into a crystal structure by organic linkers, have a potential to host exotic magnetic states. We present a study of bulk magnetic properties of four metal-organic frameworks with the same boron imidazolate linkers, Cu-BIF, Co-BIF, Ni-BIF, and newly synthesized Zn-BIF, displaying a variety of lattice structures and nontrivial magnetic behaviors. While non-magnetic Zn-BIF provides an offset of magnetic response, magnetic susceptibility measurements of the other three magnetic materials demonstrate the presence of weak magnetic interactions in these MOFs, which differ between materials by sign and size. Cu-BIF, where magnetic nodes are connected into octahedral cages, shows simple paramagnetic behavior. Triangular lattice Co-MOF shows antiferromagnetic interactions on the order of 1 K, and a spin-crossover-like effect in magnetic susceptibility due to thermal depopulation of excited crystal electric field levels. Magnetic properties of Ni-BIF suggest sizable ferromagnetic interactions. Using DC/AC susceptibility and variable-field DC magnetization, we detect cluster spin-glass behavior in Ni-BIF and discuss possible microscopic origins of this behavior. This work demonstrates the variety of magnetic properties that are possible with a single organic ligand, and establishes the low energy scale of magnetic interactions through superexchange in boron imidazolate frameworks.

Abstract: Structural defects are important for both solid-state chemistry and physics, as they can have a significant impact on chemical stability and physical properties. Here, we identify a vacancyinduced pseudo-gap formation in antiferromagnetic Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb. Cr$_{1-x}$ZnSb alloys were studied combining efforts of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental methods to elucidate the effect of vacancies. Detailed analyses (X-ray powder and single crystal diffraction, transmission and secondary scanning electron microscopy) of Cr$_{1-x}$ZnSb, $0<0.20$, prompts Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb as the only stable compound, crystallizing with the MnAlGe-type structure. From DFT calculations, an antiferromagnetic spin configuration of Cr local magnetic moments was found to be favorable for both, the perfectly stoichiometric compound CrZnSb, as well as for Cr$_{0.875}$ZnSb. Magnetic order is observed experimentally for Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb by temperature- and field-dependent magnetization measurements, revealing a magnetic phase transition near 220 K, which is corroborated by zero-field muon spin relaxation studies. Thermoelectric transport properties exhibit distinct maxima in the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity at around 190 K. Analyzing the measured data on the basis of a triple parabolic band model and DFT simulations, their characteristic features are traced back to a pseudo-gap in the electronic structure arising from a particular vacancy arrangement. These findings offer valuable insights into the role of vacancies in defected materials, contributing to the broader understanding of structural defects and their impact on the electronic structure.

Abstract: Quantum spin models with a large number of interaction partners per spin are frequently used to describe modern many-body quantum optical systems like arrays of Rydberg atoms, atom-cavity systems or trapped ion crystals. For theoretical analysis the mean-field (MF) ansatz is routinely applied. However, besides special cases of all-to-all or strong long range interactions, the MF ansatz provides only approximate results. Here we present a systematic correction to MF theory based on diagrammatic perturbation theory for quantum spin correlators in thermal equilibrium. Our analytic results are universally applicable for any lattice geometry and spin-length S. We provide pre-computed and easy-to-use building blocks for Ising, Heisenberg and transverse field Ising models in the symmetry-unbroken regime. We showcase the quality and simplicity of the method by computing magnetic phase boundaries and excitations gaps. We also treat the Dicke-Ising model of ground-state superradiance where we show that corrections to the MF phase boundary vanish.

Abstract: Magnon dynamics in quantum magnetism have long sparked interest in condensed matter physics. Since Bethe's prediction nearly a century ago, multimagnon bound states have presented significant potential for both fundamental insights and technological applications. Despite this, observing these bound states in natural materials has been challenging, partly due to the prevailing view that high magnetic fields are necessary for their stabilization. Here, we demonstrate that low-dimensional spin systems, specifically quasi-one-dimensional edge-shared cuprates, offer a promising landscape for realizing multimagnon bound states through a novel stabilization mechanism. This approach leverages small antiferromagnetic interchain couplings that act as effective internal magnetic fields, promoting collinear antiferromagnetic order and fostering self-organized magnon condensation at lower field strengths. By circumventing the need for high external fields, this mechanism provides a more experimentally accessible pathway, with implications for developing magnon-based quantum computing architectures, low-power spintronic devices, and high-speed magnonic circuits for efficient information processing. Our study presents a theoretical framework, supported by numerical simulations and experimental data from quasi-one-dimensional cuprates such as Li$_2$CuO$_2$, Ca$_2$Y$_2$Cu$_5$O$_{10}$, LiCuSbO$_4$, and PbCuSO$_4$(OH)$_2$. Beyond practical applications, our findings reveal that small interchain couplings can induce previously unobserved magnetic phenomena, offering new insights into the nature of magnetic ordered states.

Abstract: We compute the mod-2 cohomology ring for three-dimensional (3D) space groups and establish a connection between them and the lattice structure of crystals with space group symmetry. This connection allows us to obtain a complete set of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints, specifying the conditions under which a unique, symmetric, gapped ground state cannot exist in 3D lattice magnets. We associate each of these constraints with an element in the third mod-2 cohomology of the space group, when the internal symmetry acts on-site and its projective representations are classified by powers of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We demonstrate the relevance of our results to the study of $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids on the 3D pyrochlore lattice. We determine, through anomaly matching, the symmetry fractionalization patterns of both electric and magnetic charges, extending previous results from projective symmetry group classifications.

Abstract: Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from the environment. At the same time, a finite degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Therefore, detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. While various platforms enabled single-shot readout of nuclear spins, their direct environments were either unknown or impossible to controllably modify on the atomic scale. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual $^{\text{49}}$Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its lifetime to be in the order of seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on the pumping and relaxation mechanisms of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and tunnelling current, which is supported by model calculations. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically assembled qubit platforms.

Abstract: Based on a microscopic model of nonequilibrium carrier generation in a leaky dielectric, we analytically derive hysteresis loops for the dielectric response of non-polar, non-ferroelectric materials. We demonstrate how complex dielectric responses can arise solely from energy and voltage polarity-dependent transport and asymmetries in the transfer rates. By combining Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and voltammetry, we address critical questions related to the microscopic mechanisms in poorly conductive systems dominated by displacement currents. The impedance analysis, extended to higher-order harmonics, provides deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of dielectric materials, emphasizing the need to correlate impedance spectroscopy with dielectric spectroscopy for a thorough understanding of dipole relaxation and transport phenomena. Our findings offer valuable perspectives for applications in capacitors, transistors, and memory devices.

Abstract: A perpendicular magnetic field penetrating a thin type-II superconductor slab produces vortices, with one vortex per flux quantum, h/2e. The vortices interact repulsively and form an ordered array (Abrikosov lattice) in clean systems, while strong disorder changes the lattice into a vortex glass. Here we investigate type-II superconducting films (PdBi2 and NbSe2) with surface acoustic waves (SAWs) at mK temperature. When sweeping the magnetic field at an extremely slow rate, we observe a series of spikes in the attenuation and velocity of the SAW, on average separated in field by approximately Hc1. We suspect the following scenario: The vortex-free region at the edges of the film produces an edge barrier across which the vortices can enter or leave. When the applied field changes, the induced supercurrents flowing along this edge region lowers this barrier until there is an instability. At that point, vortices avalanche into (or out of) the bulk and change the vortex crystal, suggested by the sharp jump in each such spike. The vortices then gradually relax to a new stable pinned configuration, leading to a ~30s relaxation after the jump. Our observation enriches the limited experimental evidence on the important topic of real-time vortex dynamics in superconductors.

Abstract: Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we drive a ferrimagnet with periodic pump pulses to construct time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes. We observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges, indicating the time-varying strong magnon coupling and the formation of time interfaces. Using a frequency comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes. The frequency spacing of the multiplied magnon modes inversely correlates with the separation between two time slits, analogous to the well-known Yang's double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.

arXiv:2411.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the scanning time of very-low field (VLF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, commonly employed for stroke diagnosis, can enhance patient comfort and operational efficiency. The conventional parallel imaging (PI) technique for high-field MRI should be tailored to apply here, considering the differences in the direction of the main magnetic field and the presence of noise. A VLF-specific PI algorithm and phased-array coil are proposed, marking the first application of PI in VLF MRI. Reconstruction quality is enhanced by denoising undersampled k-space data using a linear-prediction based Kalman filter. Subsequently, the denoised k-space data are nonlinearly mapped from the original space onto a high-dimensional feature space, utilizing a polynomial feature mapping defined nonlinear frame. Frame parameters are calculated using auto-calibration signals (ACS) from the center k-space, and missing phase-encoding lines in the original space are estimated using acquired lines in the feature space. An 8-channel phased-array coil, designed for a vertical main magnetic field, is decoupled using geometric overlap and a low input impedance (LII) preamplifier. Healthy volunteer head imaging experiments using the proposed PI technique exhibit the lowest mean-squared-error (MSE) value and the highest peak-signal-to-noise (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) values compared to two widely used PI methods. The proposed PI technique enables the VLF MRI scanner to achieve similar image quality and a 72.5% improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to fully sampled images while requiring less than 50% of the scan time. We present a PI technique tailored for VLF MRI scanner for the first time, along with potential research direction to achieve greater reduction factor.

Abstract: The coupling of matter to the quantized electromagnetic field of a plasmonic or optical cavity can be harnessed to modify and control chemical and physical properties of molecules. In optical cavities, a term known as the dipole self-energy (DSE) appears in the Hamiltonian to assure gauge invariance. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we introduce a method, which has its own merits and complements existing methods, to compute the DSE. Second, we study the impact of the DSE on cavity-induced nonadiabatic dynamics in a realistic system. For that purpose, various matrix elements of the DSE are computed as functions of the nuclear coordinates and the dynamics of the system after laser excitation is investigated. The cavity is known to induce conical intersections between polaritons, which gives rise to substantial nonadiabatic effects. The DSE is shown to slightly affect these light-induced conical intersections and, in particular, break their symmetry.

Suitable telescopes are kilometre-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance between quasi free-falling mirrors. Recent advances in quantum metrology may now provide the required sensitivity boost. So-called squeezed light is able to quantum entangle the high-power laser fields in the interferometer arms, and could play a key role in the realization of gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: The 2D projective nature of X-ray radiography presents significant limitations in fluoroscopy-guided interventions, particularly the loss of depth perception and prolonged radiation exposure. Integrating magnetic trackers into these workflows is promising; however, it remains challenging and under-explored in current research and practice. To address this, we employed a radiolucent magnetic field generator (FG) prototype as a foundational step towards seamless magnetic tracking (MT) integration. A two-layer FG mounting frame was designed for compatibility with various C-arm X-ray systems, ensuring smooth installation and optimal tracking accuracy. To overcome technical challenges, including accurate C-arm pose estimation, robust fluoro-CT registration, and 3D navigation, we proposed the incorporation of external aluminum fiducials without disrupting conventional workflows. Experimental evaluation showed no clinically significant impact of the aluminum fiducials and the C-arm on MT accuracy. Our fluoro-CT registration demonstrated high accuracy (mean projection distance approxiamtely 0.7 mm, robustness (wide capture range), and generalizability across local and public datasets. In a phantom targeting experiment, needle insertion error was between 2 mm and 3 mm, with real-time guidance using enhanced 2D and 3D navigation. Overall, our results demonstrated the efficacy and clinical applicability of the MT-assisted approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate a radiolucent FG into a fluoroscopy-guided workflow.

Abstract: This work introduces an approach to compute periodic phase diagram of micromagnetic systems by solving a periodic linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation using an eigenvalue solver with the Finite Element Method formalism. The linear operator in the eigenvalue problem is defined as a function of the periodic phase shift wave vector. The dispersion diagrams are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for complex eigen frequencies and corresponding eigen states for a range of prescribed wave vectors. The presented approach incorporates a calculation of the periodic effective field, including the exchange and magnetostatic field components. The approach is general in that it allows handling 3D problems with any 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities. The ability to calculated periodic diagrams provides insights into the spin wave propagation and localized resonances in complex micromagnetic structures.

Abstract: In the regime of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, we study the correlated behaviors between the transmission spectra of a pair of probe fields passing through respective parallel one-dimensional cold Rydberg ensembles. Due to the van der Waals (vdW) interactions between Rydberg atoms, each ensemble exhibits a local optical nonlinearity, where the output EIT spectra are sensitive to both the input probe intensity and the photonic statistics. More interestingly, a nonlocal optical nonlinearity emerges between two spatially separated ensembles, as the probe transmissivity and probe correlation at the exit of one Rydberg ensemble can be manipulated by the probe field at the input of the other Rydberg ensemble. Realizing correlated Rydberg EITs holds great potential for applications in quantum control, quantum network, quantum walk and so on.

# Multi-spacecraft observations of the decay phase of solar energetic particle events

## 太阳高能粒子事件衰变阶段的多航天器观测

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07903

arXiv:2411.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Parameters of solar energetic particle (SEP) event profiles such as the onset time and peak time have been researched extensively to obtain information on acceleration and transport of SEPs. Corotation of particle-filled magnetic flux tubes with the Sun is generally thought to play a minor role in determining intensity profiles. However recent simulations have suggested that corotation has an effect on SEP decay phases, depending on the location of the observer with respect to the active region (AR) associated with the event. Aims: We aim to determine whether signatures of corotation are present in observations of decay phases of SEP events and study how the parameters of the decay phase depend on the properties of the flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the events. Methods: We analyse multi-spacecraft observations of SEP intensity profiles from 11 events between 2020 and 2022, using data from SOLO, PSP, STEREO-A, and SOHO. We determine the decay time constant, \tau in 3 energy channels; electrons ~ 1 MeV, protons ~ 25 MeV, and protons ~ 60 MeV. We study the dependence of \tau on the longitudinal separation, \Delta \phi, between source active region (AR) and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint on the Sun.
  Results: Within individual events there is a tendency for the decay time constant to decrease with increasing $\Delta \phi$, in agreement with test particle simulations. The intensity of the associated flare and speed of the associated CMEs have a strong effect on the measured $\tau$ values and are likely the cause of the observed large inter-event variability.
  Conclusions: We conclude that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phase of a solar energetic particle event and should be included in future simulations and interpretations of these events.

Abstract: Tidal flow of seawater across the Earth's magnetic field induces electric currents and magnetic fields within the ocean and solid Earth. The amplitude and phase of the induced fields depends on electrical properties of both the seawater and the solid Earth, thus can be used as a proxy to study seabed properties or potentially for monitoring long-term trends in the global ocean climatology. This paper presents new global oceanic tidal magnetic field models and their uncertainties for four tidal constituents, including $M_2, N_2, O_1$ and $Q_1$, which was not reliably retrieved previously. Models are obtained through a robust least-squares analysis of magnetic field observations from the \textit{Swarm} and CHAMP satellites using a specially designed data selection scheme. We compare the retrieved magnetic signals with several alternative models reported in the literature. Additionally, we validate them using a series of high-resolution global 3-D electromagnetic simulations and place constraints on the conductivity of sub-oceanic mantle for all tidal constituents, revealing an excellent agreement between all tidal constituents and the oceanic upper mantle structure.

Abstract: Searches for violations of the fundamental symmetries of parity P and time reversal T in atomic and molecular systems provide a powerful tool for precise measurements of the physics of and beyond the standard model. In this work, we investigate how these symmetry violations affect the response of atoms and molecules to applied electric and magnetic fields. We recover well-known observables such as the P-odd, T-odd spin-electric field coupling that is used for searches of the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) or the effect of P-odd, T-even optical rotation in atomic gases. Besides these, we obtain several other possible observables. This includes, in particular, effects that can only be seen when using oscillating or inhomogeneous fields.

# Curie Point Depth as a Key Indicator of Hydrocarbon Maturity in the Southeastern Niger Delta Basin: Insights From Aeromagnetic Data

## 居里点深度是尼日尔三角洲盆地东南部碳氢化合物成熟度的关键指标: 来自航磁数据的见解

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5194917/latest

This study focuses on the Curie point depth (CPD) as a critical factor in determining the hydrocarbon potential of the southeastern Niger Delta Basin, using aeromagnetic data to analyze subsurface thermal structures. The Curie point depth, which marks the depth at which ferromagnetic minerals lose their magnetic properties at a temperature of approximately 580&amp;deg;C, varies across the basin from 23.27 km to 83.15 km, with an average of 60.36 km. These variations in CPD, combined with geothermal gradient values ranging from 6.98&amp;deg;C/km to 24.93&amp;deg;C/km, and heat flow measurements between 17.44 mW/m&amp;sup2; and 62.33 mW/m&amp;sup2;, provide insights into the thermal maturity of hydrocarbons in different regions. The findings indicate that blocks with intermediate CPD values, such as Blocks 2, 4, 7, and 29, with depths between 55.44 km and 62.60 km, are conducive to oil exploration due to their balanced thermal regimes. Conversely, blocks with shallow CPD values, like Block 9 (23.27 km), exhibit higher heat flow and geothermal gradients, making them better suited for gas exploration due to over-maturation of hydrocarbons. In contrast, deeper CPD regions, like Block 36 (83.15 km), reflect under-mature conditions, where hydrocarbon formation has not yet reached optimal levels. This study underscores the importance of CPD in guiding hydrocarbon exploration strategies in the Niger Delta Basin.

Background Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS) caused by Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) is a rare and uncommon. Further reports and thorough evaluation are needed to identify and manage this disease.Method We described the case of a 49-year-old lady, exhibiting features of Budd-Chiari syndrome secondary to intravenous leiomyomatosis, and reviewed other three previous cases of BCS caused by IVL.Results The mean onset age of these four patients was 54.8 years. All but one (patient No.2) had a history of myoma, myomectomy, or hysterectomy. Abdominal pain, bloating or increasing abdominal birth, and bilateral lower extremity edema were common symptoms. The establishment of clinical diagnoses of IVL and BCS mainly depends on clinical presentations and imaging like ultrasonography, CT (with vascular reconstruction), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Surgical intervention to alleviate the hepatic veins outflow obstruction is the most important treatment.Conclusions BCS caused by IVL should be considered when inferior vena cava (IVC) and right atrium (RA) lesions occur in a patient with characteristics of BCS and a history of uterine myoma or hysterectomy. Complete tumor resection with TAHBSO is the only curative treatment and should be performed as soon as possible.

In response to the increasingly severe antibiotic pollution in water bodies, this study developed a new type of magnetic nano cobalt @ nano zero valent iron that is easy to prepare and inexpensive( nCo@nZVI ) Composite materials. The magnetic sheet-like nZVI was prepared using a rheological phase inversion method, followed by the synthesis of nCo@nZVI through liquid-phase reduction. The material's physical and chemical properties, along with its structure, were meticulously characterized through the utilization of various techniques, including BET, FESEM, XRD, HRTEM, EDS, XPS, and FTIR. Batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the adsorption-degradation mechanism of TC by the material in the Fenton system, and to investigate the effects of factors such as temperature, pH value, and initial TC ion concentration on removal efficiency. The results indicated that under conditions of pH 7 and temperature of 20&amp;deg;C, the nCo@nZVI material could reduce the TC concentration in wastewater from an initial 20mg/L to trace levels within 120 minutes. Adsorption kinetics and isotherm analysis revealed that the adsorption process of TC by nCo@nZVI followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating predominantly chemical adsorption with an adsorption capacity of 25.33mg/g. Thermodynamic studies have shown that the adsorption of TC by nCo@nZVI occurs spontaneously. Furthermore, the nCo@nZVI composite material is environmentally friendly and cost-effective. It has the advantages of being recyclable and reusable under external magnetic fields, showing great potential in the remediation of antibiotic contaminated sites, and this method has guiding significance for the recovery of cobalt containing wastewater.

# Monitoring March 2024 solar and geomagnetic storm using broad-band seismometers

## 使用宽带地震仪监测2024 3月的太阳和地磁风暴

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5095799/latest

The abrupt variations in the magnetic field due to the May 2024 geomagnetic storm have been recorded by broadband seismometers distributed around the world for a time interval of more than 55 hours. Signals related to magnetic field variations can be identified in seismic data for frequencies below 10 mHz, but are clearer between 1.5 and 5 mHz, the frequency band corresponding to Pc5 magnetic pulsations. The number of seismological stations that detect these signals varies significantly between the various seismic networks analyzed, but in general they do not exceed 50&amp;ndash;60%. The origin of these signals appears to be related to the interaction between telluric currents induced by magnetic field disturbances associated with the geomagnetic storm and the detection systems in broadband sensors, which measure the current intensity necessary to keep the mass of the seismometer fixed. Although detailed calibration of each seismometer will be necessary to use the seismic data to model the waveforms and amplitudes of the magnetic pulsations, the analysis of this data provides a significant densification with respect to the magnetic observatory data, as is of interest to analyze the temporal and regional evolution of the magnetics disturbances associated to the May 2024 solar storm.

# Research on the Prediction Model of Material Removal Rate in the&nbsp;Magnetic Abrasive Finishing Process

## 磁性研磨光整加工中材料去除率预测模型的研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5365534/latest

As an advanced precision machining process, magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) technology can be applied to grind complex workpieces. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not conducive to formulate an appropriate processing that MAF processing on tubular workpiece has a severe lack of well defined material removal model. In order to solve this problem, the contact form between magnetic abrasive and workpiece surface was simplified, and the force analysis of magnetic abrasive in the magnetic field was performed. Furthermore, an ideal predictive model on material removal rate was proposed, which was based on both the quantity of active abrasives in the processing area and the depth at which magnetic abrasive was pressed into the workpiece. The correction factor 'k' was determined based on the comparison and analysis of experimental results and theoretical predictions. What&amp;rsquo;s more, the accuracy of the revised model on material removal rate was confirmed. The surface roughness of workpiece was reduced from 0.213 &amp;micro;m to 0.058 &amp;micro;m after undergoing 19 cycles of processing under the conditions of spindle speed of 1000 rad/min, abrasive mass of 3.5 g, machining gap of 2 mm, and a feed rate of 3 mm/s. The material removal rate was 0.140 &amp;micro;m/min, which exhibits an absolute error of 7.675% in comparison to the predicted value of 0.152 &amp;micro;m/min. The results indicate that the model can meet the prediction requirements of material removal rate in MAF process, and MAF technology can effectively achieve finishing on the inner surface of pipes.

# Surgical Outcomes of Tethered Spinal Cord Syndrome in Patients with Normal Conus Medullaris and Filum Terminale without Urologic Symptoms

## 无泌尿系统症状的正常脊髓圆锥和终丝患者脊髓栓系综合征的手术结果

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5062881/latest

Purpose: In this study, surgical results of tethered spinal cord patients without urologic symptoms with conus medullaris terminating at normal level and filum terminale with normal appearance are presented. Our hypothesis is that patients operated for tethered spinal cord syndrome without urologic symptoms do not develop urologic symptoms during the follow-up period.
Methods: This retrospective study included 59 operated patients with tethered spinal cord syndrome who had a normal level terminating conus medullaris and a normal looking filum terminale without urologic symptoms. Of these patients, 38 were female and 21 were male. All patients underwent somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The surgical technique used was flavotomy, which involves cutting the filum terminale without performing a laminectomy.
Results: The mean age of the patients included in the study was 22.5 years and SD(13.2). The operated patients did not develop urinary incontinence during a mean postoperative follow-up period of 2.5 years. SSEP also revealed block in 39 (66.1%) patients, a low amplitude in 12 (20.3%) patients and a delayed N22 wave latency, which was observed in 8 patients (13.5%). There is no surgical morbidity and mortality. Postoperatively, the significant improvements were seen in SSEP.
Conclusion: Although filum terminale looks normal in MRI, it may stil cause tethered cord syndrome because of its defective development of the inner structure. Our study concludes that SSEPs are valuable in diagnosis and that urological symptoms do not develop in the long-term follow-up of patients who were operated on without initial urological symptoms.

# 18F-FET PET/CT Can Aid in Diagnosing Patients with Indeterminate MRI Findings for Brain Tumors: A Prospective Study

## 18F-FET PET/CT可帮助诊断MRI表现不确定的脑肿瘤患者: 一项前瞻性研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5062302/latest

Objective This prospective study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of fluorine-18-labeled fluoroethyltyrosine (18F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing brain tumors within an Asian patient population.Methods Patients suspected of having primary or recurrent brain tumors were prospectively recruited. Each patient underwent 18F-FET and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT on separate days within one week. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy to compare the diagnostic performance of the two PET scans. The standardized uptake value (SUV) and tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) of the lesions were determined using static images. Additionally, time-activity curves (TACs) and time-to-peak (TTP) were generated from the dynamic PET images.Results From September 2019 to December 2023, 33 subjects were enrolled for reasons including suspected brain tumors (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;20) or suspicious glioma recurrence (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;8) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and restaging for glioma (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;5). Among the patients with suspected brain tumors or glioma recurrence on MRI, 25% had false-positive results. 18F-FET PET/CT accurately identified 86% of these false positives. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of visual interpretation of 18F-FET PET/CT were 96.15%, 85.71%, 96.15%, 85.71%, and 93.90%, respectively. The corresponding 18F-FDG PET/CT values were 73.08%, 71.42%, 90.48%, 41.67%, and 72.70%. 18F-FET PET/CT demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy than 18F-FDG PET (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.031 and p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.030, respectively). Using TBRmean as an adjunct reference index enhanced the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FET PET/CT, achieving a sensitivity and NPV of 100%. Wash-out TAC or TTP&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;20 min was associated with a PPV of 100% for brain tumors.Conclusions  18F-FET PET/CT appears to be a valuable tool for assessing brain tumors with indeterminate MRI findings in this Asian cohort. 18F-FET PET/CT offers benefits over 18F-FDG PET in differentiating brain tumors from nontumor brain lesions, particularly when using semiquantitative analysis with TBR.

# Analysis and Experimental Determination of Fluid Dynamics Within a Sphere for the Development of Multi Degree of Freedom Attitude Control Actuator

## 用于开发多自由度姿态控制执行器的球体内流体动力学分析和实验确定

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5369204/latest

In the contemporary landscape of spacecraft engineering, reaction wheels, control moment gyros, and momentum wheels are standard tools for precise attitude control, functioning by exchanging angular momentum through the rotation of a solid mass around its major axis.
The VEKTOR-FDA (Vector Fluid Dynamic Actuator) proposed in this paper offers an alternative by utilizing the principle of rotating liquid to generate angular momentum instead of relying on a solid body. Electromagnetic pumps drive and circulate the fluid, connecting to a hollow sphere via inlet and outlet channels. The fluid within the sphere is drawn into the pump through the outlet channel and reintroduced through the inlet channel. This circulation, combined with the spherical shape, generates a rotational fluid flow inside the hollow sphere, creating a rotating fluid volume and an angular momentum vector aligned with the rotation axis.
By utilizing at least three pumps arranged orthogonally, simultaneous operation allows flow mixing, which can be precisely controlled by adjusting the individual flow velocities of each pump. This setup enables the rotation axis of the fluid flow to be directed in any desired orientation, allowing the rotating fluid volume and its angular momentum vector to be spatially aligned as needed. As a result, a single VEKTOR-FDA actuator can manage attitude control across all three axes of the spacecraft, effectively functioning as a multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) actuator.
The electromagnetic pump drive in the VEKTOR-FDA actuator provides self-lubrication and eliminates the need for moving mechanical parts, minimizing potential damage from mechanical loads like shocks during launch. Its simple design also enables the use of commercial off-the-shelf components, ensuring cost-effective implementation.
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the motivation and concept behind the VEKTOR-FDA actuator. Additionally, this paper presents analyses and experimental results that investigate how rotating fluid flow can be generated within the sphere and examines its behavior. The study evaluates various factors influencing fluid flow inside the sphere, including configurations with variable cross-sectional shapes of the inlet and outlet channels. Furthermore, it determines the optimal positioning and arrangement of these channels to achieve efficient fluid flow volume, which is essential for maximizing angular momentum output.
