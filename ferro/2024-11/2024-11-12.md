# Charge transfer spin-polarons and ferromagnetism in weakly doped AB-stacked TMD heterobilayers

## 弱掺杂AB堆叠TMD异质层中的电荷转移自旋极化子和铁磁性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05908

arXiv:2411.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of ferromagnetic and magnetic polaron states in weakly doped heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the ``heavy fermion'' limit in which one layer hosts a dense set of local moments and the other hosts a low density of itinerant holes. We show that interactions among the carriers in the itinerant layer induces a ferromagnetic exchange. We characterize the ground state finding a competition, controlled by the carrier concentration and interlayer exchange, between a layer decoupled phase of itinerant carriers in a background of local moments, a fully polarized ferromagnet and a canted antiferromagnet. In the canted antiferromagnet phase the combination of the in-plane 120$^{\circ}$ N\'eel order and Ising spin orbit couplings induces winding in the electronic wavefunction giving rise to a topologically non-trivial spin texture and an observable anomalous Hall effect. At larger carrier density the ferromagnetically ordered phase transitions into a paramagnetic heavy Fermi liquid state. This theory enables a comprehensive understanding of the existing experimental observations while also making predictions including experimental signatures enabling direct imaging of spin polaron bound states with scanning tunneling microscopy. Our work shows that the prevailing paradigm of the (Doniach) phase diagram of heavy fermion metals is fundamentally modified in the low doping regime of heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

# $SU(N)$ spin-phonon simulations of Floquet dynamics in spin $S > 1/2$ Mott insulators

## $ SU(N)$ 自旋 $ S &gt; 1/2 $ Mott绝缘体中Floquet动力学的自旋声子模拟

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05919

arXiv:2411.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of magnetic moments coupled to phonons is of great interest for understanding spin transport in solids as well as for our ability to control magnetism via tailored phonon modes. For spin $S > 1/2$, spin-orbit coupling permits an unusual linear coupling of phonons to quadrupolar moments, so that phonons act as a dynamical transverse field for the spins. Here, we develop a generalized $SU(N)$ spin-phonon Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics technique to simulate the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of such spin-orbital-phonon coupled Mott insulators, and apply it to a spin-1 model with competing XY antiferromagnet (AFM) and quadrupolar paramagnet (QPM) phases which is relevant to the Mott insulator $\rm{Ba_2FeSi_2O_7}$. We uncover a rich variety of dynamical phenomena in this system induced by linear or chiral phonon drives, including the generation of a uniform magnetization in the QPM and AFM, strengthening of N\'eel order and gapping of the AFM Nambu-Goldstone mode by Floquet-Ising anisotropy, a non-equilibrium QPM to AFM transition, and creation of Floquet copies of transverse and longitudinal spin waves. We discuss implications of our work for $\rm{Ba_2FeSi_2O_7}$ and highlight future research directions in this field.

arXiv:2411.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high pressure electrical transport, magnetization, and single crystal X-ray diffraction data on SrCo2P2 single crystals. X-ray diffraction data show that there is a transition to a collapsed tetragonal structure for p ~> 10 GPa and measurements of resistance show that above ~ 10 GPa, a clear transition-like feature can be observed at temperatures up to 260 K. Further magnetization, magnetoresistance and Hall measurements made under pressure all indicate that this transition is to a ferromagnetic ground state. First principles-based density functional theory (DFT) calculations also show that there is a first-order transition between tetragonal and collapsed tetragonal (cT) phases, with an onset near ~ 10 GPa as well as the appearance of the ferromagnetic (FM) ordering in the cT phase. Above ~ 30 GPa, the experimental signatures of the magnetic ordering vanish in a first-order-like manner, consistent with the theoretical calculation results, indicating that SrCo2P2 is another example of the avoidance of quantum criticality in ferromagnetic intermetallic compounds. SrCo2P2 provides clear evidence that the structural, electronic and magnetic properties associated with the cT transition are strongly entangled and are not only qualitatively captured by our first principles-based calculations but are quantitatively reproduced as well.

Abstract: In this work, we probe the sensitivity of hole-spin properties to hole occupation number in a planar silicon double-quantum dot device fabricated on a 300 mm integrated platform. Using DC transport measurements, we investigate the g-tensor and spin-relaxation induced leakage current within the Pauli spin-blockade regime as a function of magnetic-field orientation at three different hole occupation numbers. We find the g-tensor and spin-leakage current to be highly anisotropic due to light-hole/heavy-hole mixing and spin-orbit mixing, but discover the anisotropies to be relatively insensitive to the dot hole number. Furthermore, we extract the dominant inter-dot spin-orbit coupling mechanism as surface Dresselhaus, with an in-plane orientation parallel to transport and magnitude $\boldsymbol{t_{SO}}$ $\approx$ 300 neV. Finally, we observe a strong correlation between the g-factor difference ($\delta$$\boldsymbol{g}$) between each dot and the spin-leakage current anisotropy, as a result of $\delta$$\boldsymbol{g}$ providing an additional spin-relaxation pathway, and should be considered. ]Our findings indicate that hole-spin devices are not as sensitive to precise operating conditions as anticipated. This has important implications optimizing spin control and readout based on magnetic-field direction, together with tuning large arrays of QDs as spin-qubits.

Abstract: The structural and magnetic properties of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ averievite (CsBr)Cu$_5$V$_2$O$_{10}$ are investigated by means of temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and $^{51}$V nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The crystal structure (trigonal, $P\bar{3}$) features a frustrated capped-kagome lattice of the magnetic Cu$^{2+}$ ions. Magnetic susceptibility analysis indicates a large Curie-Weiss temperature of $\theta_{\rm CW} \simeq-175$ K. Heat capacity signals the onset of a magnetic long-range-order (LRO) at $T_{\rm N}\simeq 21.5$ K at zero magnetic field due to the presence of significant inter-planer coupling in this system. The magnetic LRO below 27 K is further evident from the drastic change in the $^{51}$V NMR signal intensity and rapid enhancement in the $^{51}$V spin-lattice relaxation rate in a magnetic field of 6.3 T. The frustration index $f=|\theta_{\rm CW}|/T_{\rm N} \simeq 8$ ascertains strong magnetic frustration in this compound. From the high-temperature value of the $^{51}$V NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate, the leading antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the Cu$^{2+}$ ions is calculated to be $J/k_{\rm B}\simeq 136$ K.

Abstract: Yttrium calcium aluminate, with the formula CaYAl3O7, has been extensively researched due to its remarkable luminescent properties when doped or co-doped. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional piezoelectric properties at high temperatures. However, the potential magnetic properties this material can acquire through doping or co-doping have largely gone unexplored until now. In this innovative study, we investigate the quantum magnetic characteristics of yttrium calcium aluminate particles doped with transition metals such as cobalt, iron, and nickel. Our magnetic measurements of hysteresis curves in the macroscopic regime reveal intriguing magnetic characteristics that have not been documented in the literature. Given the high applicability of this material in biological microelectromechanical systems, we conducted a detailed study to demonstrate these findings.

# Quantifying Crystallographic Orientation Effects on Tunneling Magnetoresistance via Transfer Matrix and Simulation

## 通过传输矩阵和模拟量化晶体取向对隧道磁阻的影响

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06147

arXiv:2411.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer matrix method (TMM) is widely used to analyze the transport properties of one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional systems, such as nanostructures and layered materials in spintronics. However, its application in quantifying the influence of different crystallographic orientations on tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) remains underexplored [1, 2]. This study employs the transfer matrix method to construct orientation-specific matrices, enabling a systematic investigation of conductance variations under different magnetic and crystallographic conditions. This approach offers a deeper understanding of how crystallographic orientation modulates TMR by developing a framework that adapts the TMM to account for orientation-dependent electronic states and interfacial characteristics [3]. Fundamentally, the TMM represents the partition function for systems with interactions limited to nearest neighbors. It is particularly well-suited for modeling spin-dependent electron tunneling in oriented magnetic tunnel junctions [4, 5].

arXiv:2411.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain is a prototypical many-body quantum model, exactly solvable via the integrable Bethe ansatz method, hosting a Tomonaga-Luttinger spin liquid. However, its clear experimental realizations remain absent. Here, we present a thorough investigation of the magnetism of the structurally disorder-free compound LuCu(OH)$_3$SO$_4$. By conducting magnetization and electron-spin-resonance measurements on the single-crystal sample, we establish that the title compound approximates the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain model with a nearest-neighbor exchange strength of $J_1$ $\sim$ 65 K and an easy-plane anisotropy of $\sim$ 0.994. The specific heat demonstrates a distinctive power-law behavior at low magnetic fields (with energy scales $\leq$ 0.02$J_1$) and low temperatures ($T$ $\leq$ 0.03$J_1$). This behavior is consistent with the expectations of the ideal spin-1/2 ferromagnetic XXZ chain model, thereby supporting the formation of a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger spin liquid in LuCu(OH)$_3$SO$_4$.

Abstract: Recently, the successful synthesis of the pentagonal form of PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$) was reported [Liu~\emph{et al.}, Nature Materials \textbf{23}, 1339 (2024)]. In this work, we present an extensive first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) based computational study of vacancies in this material. Our study covers the evolution of the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various defect configurations and compares those to the pristine monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$). We find that V$_{Pd}$ (V$_{Te}$) is the most stable defect in the~\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer in the Te-rich (Pd-rich) limit. The defects alter the electronic properties of the monolayer significantly, leading to changes in their magnetic and optical properties due to the emergence of midgap impurity states. The defect complex V$_{Pd+4Te}$ is found to induce spin-polarization in the system with a total magnetic moment of 1.87 $\mu_{B}$. The obtained low diffusion energy barriers of 1.13 eV (in-plane) and 0.063 eV (top-bottom) corresponding to V$_{Te}$ indicates its facile migration probability is higher in the top-bottom direction at room temperature, as revealed by AIMD simulations as well. In order to guide the experimentalists, we also simulated the scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) images corresponding to all the defect configurations. Moreover, we also computed the electron-beam energies required for creating mono-vacancies. In the optical absorption spectra of the defective configurations, finite peaks appear below the band edge that are unique to the respective defective configuration. We have also computed the excess polarizability of the defective configurations with respect to the pristine one and found that maximum changes occur in the infrared and visible regions, providing insights into the change in their optical response as compared to the pristine monolayer.

# Anomalous switching pattern in the ferrimagnetic memory cell

## 铁磁存储单元中的异常开关模式

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06321

arXiv:2411.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replacing the ferromagnet with ferrimagnet (FiM) in the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) allows faster magnetization switching in picoseconds. The operation of a memory cell that consists of the MTJ and a transistor requires reversable magnetization switching. When a constant voltage is applied, we find that the spin-transfer torque can only switch the FiM-MTJ from parallel to antiparallel state. This stems from the small switching window of FiM and the dynamic resistance variation during the magnetization switching. We find the resulting current variation can be suppressed by reducing the magnetoresistance ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the switching window can be expanded by adjusting the amount of Gd in FiM. We predict that the polarity of both switching current (Jc,switch) and oscillation current (Jc,osc) reverses at the angular momentum compensation point but not the magnetization compensation point. This anomalous dynamic behavior is attributed to the different physical nature of magnetization switching and oscillation in FiM, which must be considered when designing FiM-based MRAM.

# Orthogonal Spin-Orbit Torque-Induced Deterministic Switching in NiO

## NiO中的正交自旋轨道转矩引起的确定性切换

arXiv:2411.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical switching of antiferromagnet (AFM) is very important for the development of ultrafast magnetic random-access memory (MRAM). This task becomes more difficult in antiferromagnetic oxide NiO which has complex anisotropy. We show that by utilizing two spin-orbit torques (SOT) from orthogonal currents, one can deterministically switch the magnetic moments of NiO in two electrical distinguishable states that can be read out using the spin Hall magnetoresistance. This deterministic switching relies on the symmetry of SOT on different sublattices, where the sign reversal of magnetic moments leads to constructive torques in the beginning and balanced torques in the end. In addition, we show that the easy-plane anisotropy plays a key role in the switching, which has been ignored in some previous works. The uniform magnetic dynamics in this work provides a clear physical picture in understanding the SOT switching of NiO. Furthermore, the electrical writing and reading function in our device advances the development of AFM-MRAM.

# Entropic magnetic interlayer coupling

arXiv:2411.06446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomagnetism concerns the engineering of magnetic interactions in heterostructures that consist of layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. Mostly, these interactions are dominated by the minimization of energy. Here, we propose an effective magnetic interlayer coupling that is dominated by the maximization of entropy. As an example, we consider the system that mediates the effective interactions to be square spin ice, in which case we find purely entropic interactions that are long-ranged. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the entropic interlayer coupling gives rise to entropic torques on the magnetization direction. For small systems, the physical properties are well characterized by the mutual information between the two magnets that are coupled. Because entropic interactions become stronger for higher temperatures, our findings may benefit the development of nanomagnetic devices that require thermal stability.

# Proposal of a general scheme: valley polarization in antiferromagnetic bilayer systems

## 一般方案的提议: 反铁磁双层系统中的谷极化

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06454

arXiv:2411.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superior to ferromagnetic (FM) valleytronics, antiferromagnetic (AFM) counterpart exhibits ultradense and ultrafast potential due to their intrinsic advantages of zero stray field, terahertz dynamics, and compensated moment of antiferromagnets. However, the physics of spontaneous valley polarization is mainly rooted in FM hexagonal lattices and is rarely used to explore the simultaneous spin and valley polarizations in AFM materials. Here, we propose a general stacking way to achieve valley polarization in AFM bilayer systems. The hexagonal ferrovalley material is used as the basic building unit, and then the space-inversion centrosymmetric bilayer system with interlayer AFM ordering is constructed by horizontal mirror and 2-fold rotational operations, which can exhibit spontaneous valley polarization. In this construction process, the rarely explored \textit{layer-locked hidden valley polarization}, hidden Berry curvature and layer Hall effect are involved, and an out-of-plane electric field can be used to detect hidden valley polarization and to realize layer-locked anomalous valley Hall effect. We use three examples to illustrate our proposal. Firstly, the Janus GdBrI is used to prove concepts and effects involved in our design process. Secondly, the $\mathrm{RuBr_2}$ is used to demonstrate other phenomena, including valley polarization transition and \textit{near-ideal quantum spin Hall insulator}. Finally, we use our design principles to understand the valley polarization of experimentally synthesized MnSe from a new perspective. Our works establish a robust general scheme to achieve valley polarization in AFM bilayer systems, thereby opening up new avenues for AFM valleytronics.

Abstract: The impact of uniform lattice strain (with lattice parameter (LP), $a = 5.62$-$5.83$ \r{A}) and tetragonal lattice distortion (with $0.8 \leq c/a \leq1.2$ and $V_0$ volume; resulting LP: $a = 5.38$-$5.92$ \r{A}, $c = 5.33$-$6.45$ \r{A}) on the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of CoFeCrGa SGS alloy (optimized LP: $a = 5.72$ \r{A}) has been investigated. The SGS nature of CoFeCrGa remains robust under uniform strain; however, the tetragonal lattice distortion has a detrimental impact on the SGS nature, and even a small distortions lead to metallic nature for CoFeCrGa. Despite this, the tetragonally distorted structures maintain high spin polarization (SP $\geq 60\% $); except for the structure with $c/a = 0.8$, for which SP significantly decreases to $\sim 25\%$. The lattice deformation-induced magnetic anisotropy (MA) is also explored by considering the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) and the magnetic shape anisotropy (MSA). Both MCA and MSA eliminate for the Y-I ordered and uniformly strained structures, resulting in a magnetic isotropic nature for them. Conversely, the tetragonally distorted structures with $c/a < 1.0$ and $c/a > 1.0$ exhibit very high in-plane magnetic anisotropy and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, respectively; with magnitudes of $\sim 10^5$-$10^6$ J/m$^3$. For tetragonally deformed structures, MSA contribution to MA is negligible, and thus, MCA dictates the total MA. In summary, the isotropically strained structures show SGS nature, while the tetragonally distorted structures exhibit the high MA along with high SP.

arXiv:2411.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-layer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, lacking point inversion symmetry, provide an efficient platform for valleytronics, where the electronic, magnetic, valley and lattice degrees of freedom can be selectively manipulated by using polarized light. This task is however thought to be limited in parent bulk compounds where the point inversion symmetry is restored. Exploiting the underlying quantum physics in bulk materials is thus one of the biggest paradigmatic challenges. Here we show that a sizable optical Kerr rotation can be efficiently generated in a wide energy range on ultrafast timescales in bulk WSe$_2$, by means of circularly-polarized light. We rationalize these findings as a result of the hidden spin/layer/valley quantum entanglement. The spectral analysis reveals clear features at the three characteristic frequencies corresponding to the A-, B- and C-exciton edges. The origin and the relative sign of all these features is shown to stem from the selective Pauli blocking of intralayer and interlayer optical transitions. The long lifetime of the broadband Kerr response ($\tau \sim 500$ fs) provides a strong indication that coupled photo-induced electron and hole densities survive in bulk compounds longer than previously expected. The present report demonstrates that a hidden quantum entanglement is operative also in bulk centrosymmetric layered materials, opening the way for an effective exploitation of bulk WSe$_2$ in optoelectronic applications.

# Persistence of vortexlike phase fluctuations in underdoped to heavily overdoped Bi-2201 cuprates

arXiv:2411.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism that controls the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{0}$ as a function of doping is one of the central questions in cuprate high-temperature superconductors. While it is generally accepted that $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{0}$ in underdoped cuprates is not determined by the scale of pairing but by the onset of global phase coherence, the role of phase fluctuations in the overdoped region has been controversial. Here, our transport measurements in perpendicular magnetic fields ($H$) on underdoped Bi-2201 reveal immeasurably small Hall response for $T>T_{\mathrm{c}}(H)$ as a signature of SC phase with vortexlike phase fluctuations. We find that the extent of such a regime in $T$ and $H$ is suppressed near optimal doping but becomes strongly enhanced in heavily overdoped Bi-2201. Our results thus show that vortexlike phase fluctuations play an important role in the field-tuned SC transition in the heavily overdoped region, in contrast to conventional mean-field Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer description. The unexpected nonmonotonic dependence of phase fluctuations on doping provides a new perspective on the SC transition in cuprates.

arXiv:2411.06619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ponderomotive potential of a bosonic Josephson junction periodically modulated by a high-frequency electromagnetic field. Within the small population difference approximation, the ponderomotive drive induces the well-known Kapitza pendulum effect, stabilizing a $\pi$-phase mode. We discuss the parameter dependence of the dynamical transition from macroscopic quantum self-trapping to $\pi$-Josephson oscillations. Furthermore, we examine the situation where the small population difference approximation fails. In this case, an essential momentum-shortening effect emerges, leading to a stabilized $\pi/2$-phase mode under certain conditions. By mapping this to a classical pendulum scenario, we highlight the uniqueness and limitations of the $\pi/2$-phase mode in bosonic Josephson junctions.

Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW) state is a widespread phenomenon in low-dimensional metals/semimetals. The spectral weight of the associated folded bands (shadow bands) can be an intriguing trigger leading to additional Fermi surface instability and unexplored phase transitions. The rare earth tri-telluride CeTe3 exhibits a single CDW stabilized below ~400 K and antiferromagnetism below ~3 K. The distinct periodicities between the Te-square net, the CeTe block layer, and the CDW give rise to rich shadow band formations. In this work, we reveal the predominant scattering between the original and shadow bands at 4 K, with the scattering within the original bands being relatively suppressed at Fermi energy. This unconventional quasi-particle scattering collectively underscores the vital role of the shadow bands' spectral weight and the hidden matrix element effect, which are crucial for controlling electronic properties in this system. Furthermore, our finding points to the existence of rich and unexplored Fermi surface instabilities, which potentially play a role in controlling the nature of long-range antiferromagnetism at lower temperatures in the presence of finite charge-spin interaction.

Abstract: Rare earth tri-tellurides (RTe3) are van der Waals (vdW) coupled semimetals ideal for exploring exotic electronic phases. LaTe3 is especially important for understanding the fundamental Fermiology of the RTe3 family because it is non-magnetic and has a simpler charge density wave structure. In this study, we used spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to measure the Landau levels of LaTe3 with high energy resolution at 300 mK. These measurements were taken under varying magnetic fields up to 15 T, with fine intervals of 0.02 - 0.03 T. Our results reveal a pair of pronounced electron-hole Fermi pockets of similar sizes and evidence of electron-boson coupling in both pockets. Given the strong charge susceptibility typical of low-dimensional conductors, the interactions and instabilities driven by the electron-hole Fermi pockets could be a basis for searching unexplored quantum phases in other antiferromagnetic RTe3 compounds.

Abstract: Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) are one of the most mature candidates for next-generation memory technology. Recently, CrGeTe3 (CrGT) emerged as a promising PCM due to its enhanced amorphous stability and fast crystallization for embedded memory applications. The amorphous stability of CrGT was attributed to the complex layered structure of the crystalline motifs needed to initiate crystallization. A subsequent computational screening work identified several similar compounds with good thermal stability, such as InGeTe3, CrSiTe3 and BiSiTe3. Here, we explore substitution of Cr in CrGT with other 3d metals, and predict four additional layered alloys to be dynamically stable, namely, ScGeTe3, TiGeTe3, ZnGeTe3 and MnGeTe3. Thorough ab initio simulations performed on both crystalline and amorphous models of these materials indicate the former three alloys to be potential PCMs with sizable resistance contrast. Furthermore, we find that crystalline MnGeTe3 exhibits ferromagnetic behavior, whereas the amorphous state probably forms a spin-glass phase. This makes MnGeTe3 a promising candidate for magnetic phase-change applications.

Abstract: Alkali superoxides differ from conventional transition metal magnets, exhibit magnetism from partially occupied oxygen molecular $\pi^*$-orbitals. Among them, CsO$_2$ stands out for its potential to exhibit novel quantum collective phenomena, such as an orbital order induced Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state. Using ab-initio Hubbard models, superexchange theory, and experimental spin wave measurements, we propose that CsO$_2$ exhibits unconventional magnetoelectric characteristics at low temperature. Our analysis confirms a canted antiferromagnetic ground state and a spin-flop transition, with ferroelectricity is induced by breaking inversion and time-reversal symmetry in the spin-flop phase. Consequently, our analysis reveals a strong interplay not only between exchange interactions but also among magnetically-induced polarization and orbital order. The magnetic structure, stabilized by orbital order, induces magnetically-induced polarization through an antisymmetric mechanism. Overall, our results reveal the coexistence of three highly entangled orders in CsO$_2$, namely, orbital, spin and ferroelectricity.

Our results indicate a way to check the existence of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces in a stable superconducting state because the anisotropy is controlled by the direction of an applied magnetic field.

arXiv:2411.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to the ferromagnetic materials that realize the anomalous valley Hall effect by breaking time-reversal symmetry and spin-orbit coupling, the antiferromagnetic materials with the joint spatial inversion and time-reversal (PT) symmetry are rarely reported that achieve the anomalous valley Hall effect. Here, we predict that the antiferromagnetic monolayer MnBr possesses spontaneous valley polarization. The valley splitting of valence band maximum is 21.55 meV at K and K' points, which is originated from Mn-dx2-y2 orbital by analyzing the effective Hamiltonian. Importantly, monolayer MnBr has zero Berry curvature in the entire momentum space but non-zero spin-layer locked Berry curvature, which offers the condition for the anomalous valley Hall effect. In addition, the magnitude of valley splitting can be signally tuned by the onsite correlation, strain, magnetization rotation, electric field, and built-in electric field. The electric field and built-in electric field induce spin splitting due to breaking the P symmetry. Therefore, the spin-layer locked anomalous valley Hall effect can be observed in MnBr. More remarkably, the ferroelectric substrate Sc2CO2 can tune monolayer MnBr to realize the transition from metal to valley polarization semiconductor. Our findings not only extend the implementation of the anomalous valley Hall effect, but also provides a platform for designing low-power and non-volatile valleytronics devices.

Abstract: The interplay between novel topological states and superconductivity has garnered substantial interest due to its potential for topological quantum computing. The Josephson effect serves as a useful probe for edge superconductivity in these hybrid topological materials. In Josephson junctions based on topological materials, supercurrents exhibit unique quantum interference patterns, including the conventional Fraunhofer oscillations, the $\Phi_0$-periodic oscillation, and the $2\Phi_0$-periodic oscillation in response to the external magnetic field ($\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is the flux quantum, $h$ the Planck constant, and $e$ the electron charge). These interference patterns stem from varied Andreev reflection mechanisms and the associated current density profiles. This review seeks to comprehensively examine the theoretical and experimental advancements in understanding the quantum interference patterns of edge supercurrents in Josephson junctions based on quantum spin Hall, quantum Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall systems.

Abstract: The correlated phenomena of flat bands have been extensively studied in twisted systems. However, the emergent ordered states arising from interactions in intrinsic multi-orbital flat bands in kagome lattice materials remain largely unexplored. In contrast to the vanadium-based AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs), the newly discovered kagome metal CsCr3Sb5, featuring pressurized superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, structural phase transition, and density wave orders, provides a rich platform for investigating strong electron correlations in multi-orbital flat bands at the Fermi surface. Here, using ultrafast optical techniques, we reveal the gap opening and the emergence of a distinct 1x4 charge density wave (CDW) at low temperatures in CsCr3Sb5. We also find that this CDW reduces the rotational symmetry to three inequivalent nematic domains, and the exotic nematicity is further amplified by the degeneracy lifting of the multi-orbital flat bands, similar to some iron-based superconductors. Surprisingly, both CDW and orbital nematicity appear concurrently with spin and structural orders at the same temperature, indicating that a single characteristic energy scale governs the low-energy flat band physics. Our study thus pioneers the investigation of ultrafast dynamics in flat band systems at the Fermi surface, offering new insights into the interactions between multiple elementary excitations in strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we drive a ferrimagnet with periodic pump pulses to construct time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes. We observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges, indicating the time-varying strong magnon coupling and the formation of time interfaces. Using a frequency comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes. The frequency spacing of the multiplied magnon modes inversely correlates with the separation between two time slits, analogous to the well-known Yang's double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.

arXiv:2411.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Monte Carlo techniques, utilizing the Metropolis and Wolff algorithms, to investigate phase behavior and phase transitions in anisotropic Ising models. Our study encompasses the thermodynamic properties, evaluating energy, magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, magnetic entropy, and the Binder cumulant. Additionally, we examine the impact of external fields on these thermodynamic quantities at different externally applied field values. We accurately determine the critical temperature for various model scenarios by analyzing the Binder cumulant. Our investigations also include an analysis of the hysteresis loop for the model for different an-isotropic cases. In particular, our study presents the magnetocaloric effect, which is the change in temperature of magnetic material when exposed to a changing magnetic field, in the different anisotropic cases of the Ising model.

# Edge reconstruction of compressible Quantum Hall fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3

Abstract: Edge reconstruction of gate-tunable compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3 is studied by measuring transmitted conductance of two individually excited fractional $e^2/3h$ edge modes of bulk 2/3 fractional quantum Hall fluid. Our findings reveal that the measured transmitted conductance deviates from the fully equilibrated value for the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3 of the gate-tunable compressible quantum Hall fluids at higher magnetic fields. This observation suggests that at the boundary of the compressible fluid a reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge mode is present and the mode does not completely equilibrate with the inner dissipative bulk region. Consequently, this outer reconstructed edge mode supports adiabatic charge transport, allowing non-equilibrated current transport through the compressible region. These studies open new avenues for achieving robust fractional edge modes even in compressible quantum Hall fluids under strong magnetic fields, enhancing our understanding of edge state dynamics in these complex systems.

Abstract: The field of hybrid magnonics has gained significant momentum in recent years, driven by its potential to enable coherent information transfer and quantum transduction. This study delves into the tunable magnon-magnon coupling within a two-dimensional array of Ni80Fe20 (Permalloy) square nanomagnets by modulating its internal magnetic field configuration. Using a broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy, we systematically investigate the influence of the orientation of external magnetic field and microwave power on the coupling properties. Our findings reveal a pronounced anticrossing behavior, indicative of robust magnon-magnon coupling, whose strength can be tuned through both static and dynamic external parameters. The ability to modulate coupling strengths in this system highlights its potential for developing flexible and adaptive magnonic devices, crucial for future applications in quantum information processing and spintronic technologies. This work not only broadens the understanding of magnon-magnon interactions in complex geometries but also opens new avenues for the design of next-generation quantum magnonic systems.

Abstract: The features of the response of frustrated states to the external field are considered on the example of a diluted Ising chain. In the ferromagnetic case, partial ordering occurs, which leads to a decrease in entropy. In the antiferromagnetic case, the switching on of the field leads to the appearance of a long-range order in the system, although the state remains frustrated. A mapping of a one-dimensional spin model to a Markov chain is proposed, which makes it possible to study in detail the properties of correlation functions and local distributions of the states in the spin chain.

# Universally optimizable strategy for magnetic gaps towards high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall states via magnetic-insulator/topological-insulator building-blocks

Abstract: Optimizing the magnetic Zeeman-splitting term, specifically the magnetic gap of the topological surface states (TSSs), is a crucial issue and central challenge in advancing higher-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In this work, we demonstrate a counterintuitive, nonmonotonic relationship between the magnetic gap and the hybridization strength in ferromagnetic-insulator (FMI)/topological-insulator (TI) sandwich structures. Concretely, insufficient hybridization strength fails to induce a substantial magnetic gap; while excessive hybridization incandesces the competition between kinetic and Coulomb exchange interactions, thereby reducing the gap. Strong hybridization strength also spatially delocalizes the TSSs, diminishing the effective orbital coupling between TSS-based p and magnetic d orbitals, which further weakens kinetic and Coulomb exchange interaction strength. Moreover, modifying the stacking order offers an experimentally viable approach to optimizing magnetic gaps, enabling the tunability of Chern numbers, chirality and maximizing global gaps. These findings unveil a universal guiding principle for optimizing magnetic gaps in FMI-TI proximity-based QAH systems, offering valuable insights for advancing experimental implementations in this field.

# Antiferroelectric order in nematic liquids: Flexoelectricity vs electrostatics

arXiv:2411.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline phases marks a major breakthrough in soft matter research. An intermediate phase, often observed between the nonpolar and the ferroelectric nematic phase, shows a distinct antiferroelectric response to electric fields. However, its structure and formation mechanisms remain debated, with flexoelectric and electrostatics effects proposed as competing mechanisms. By controlling the magnitude of electrostatic forces through ion addition in two representative ferroelectric nematic materials, we show that the primary mechanism for the emergence of antiferroelectric order is the flexoelectric coupling between electric polarization and splay deformation of the nematic director. The addition of ions significantly expands the temperature range over which the antiferroelectric phase is observed, with this range increasing with increasing ion concentration. Polarizing optical microscopy studies and second harmonic generation microscopy reveal the splayed structure modulated in two dimensions, while SHG interferometry confirms its antiferroelectric character. We extend the model previously used to describe pretransitional behaviour by incorporating the electrostatic contribution of ions. The model shows qualitative agreement with the experiments, accurately reproducing the phase diagram and temperature-dependent evolution of the modulation period of the observed structure.

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06929

arXiv:2411.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knots and links play a crucial role in understanding topology and discreteness in nature. In magnetic systems, twisted, knotted and braided vortex tubes manifest as Skyrmions, Hopfions, or screw dislocations. These complex textures are characterized by topologically non-trivial quantities, such as a Skyrmion number, a Hopf index $H$, a Burgers vector (quantified by an integer $\nu$), and linking numbers. In this work, we introduce a discrete geometric definition of $H$ for periodic magnetic textures, which can be separated into contributions from the self-linking and inter-linking of flux tubes. We show that fractional Hopfions or textures with non-integer values of $H$ naturally arise and can be interpreted as states of ``mixed topology" that are continuously transformable to one of the multiple possible topological sectors. Our findings demonstrate a solid physical foundation for the Hopf index to take integer, non-integer, or specific fractional values, depending on the underlying topology of the system.

arXiv:2411.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layertronics that manifests layer Hall effect is typically considered to intrinsically possess binary physics. Using symmetry arguments and a low-energy kp model, we show that the layer physics in layertronics can be engineered into quaternary mode, giving rise to the concept of quadri-layertronics. The mechanism correlates to the interplay between out-of-plane ferroelectricity and valley physics in antiferromagnetic multiferroic quadrilayer, which enables the layer-locked Berry curvature and Hall effect, i.e., deflecting the carriers with four different layer physics to move in specific directions. More importantly, the quadri-layertronics can be generated and manipulated by controlling the interlayer dipole arrangements via a gate voltage, allowing for the selective induction and detection of layer Hall effect in specific layers. Using first principles calculations, we further demonstrate the gate control of quadri-layertronics in multiferroic antiferromagnet of quadrilayer OsCl2. These explored phenomena and insights greatly enrich the research on layertronics.

arXiv:2411.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetic systems, angular momentum is carried by the spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Non-local devices can be used to study angular momentum transport. They consist of parallel heavy-metal nanowires placed on top of magnetic insulators like yttrium iron garnet (YIG), facilitating the transmission of information by magnons, generated by the accumulation of spin at the interface, created via the Spin Hall Effect (SHE) and detected via the inverse SHE (iSHE). It has been demonstrated that these processes have comparable efficiencies when the role of the detector and injector is reversed, which points to reciprocity of the processes. However, we show that by adding Ru as a source of direct and inverse orbital Hall effect (OHE), the system no longer exhibits this reciprocity. Specifically, the generation of magnons via the combination of SHE and OHE and detection via the iSHE is found to be about 35% more efficient than the inverse process for our system.

Abstract: One of the most active classes of nanostructures is Fullerene C$_{20}$, which has been exploited as an active component in significant applications. In this investigation, we used Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of the mixed spins 2 and 3/2 Fullerene C$_{20}$ system. Ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic phases are stable, according to the ground state phase diagrams that have been constructed. The behavior of the magnetizations and the derivative of magnetization, in particular, have shown the impact of rising temperature. Additionally, we found an increase of the reduced Curie temperature to reach $t_C = 3$, when the interactions between the spins S are increased. For numerous reduced external magnetic fields and reduced temperatures, the magnetic entropy variations are studied. The Relative Cooling Power (RCP) is calculated. It is demonstrated that the reduced exchange coupling interactions p and r lead to an increase in the lowered magnetic coercive field.

arXiv:2411.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.

arXiv:2411.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the spin texture dynamics of a harmonically trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions under a sinusoidally varying magnetic field along the $x$-direction. This interplay yields an intrinsic spin texture in the ground state, forming a linear chain of alternating skyrmions at the saddle points. Our study analyzes the spin-mixing dynamics for both a freely evolving and a controlled longitudinal magnetization. The spin-1 system exhibits the Einstein-de Hass effect for the first case, for which an exchange between the total orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum is observed, resulting in minimal oscillations about the initial position of the skyrmion chain. However, for the fixed magnetization dynamics, the skyrmion chain exhibits ample angular oscillations about the equilibrium position, with the temporary formation of new skyrmions and anti-skyrmions to facilitate the oscillatory motion. Keeping the magnetization constant, this contrast now stems from the exchange between the canonical and spin-dependent contribution to the orbital angular momentum. The variation in canonical angular momentum is linked to the angular oscillations, while the spin-dependent angular momentum accounts for the creation or annihilation of skyrmions. We confirm the presence of scissor mode excitations in the spin texture due to the angular skyrmion oscillations.

# Evidence of zero-field Wigner solids in ultra-thin films of cadmium arsenide

arXiv:2411.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Wigner crystal is a many-body state where Coulombic repulsion quenches the kinetic energy of electrons, causing them to crystallize into a lattice. Experimental realization of a quantum Wigner crystal at zero magnetic field has been a long-sought goal. Here, we report on the experimental evidence of a Wigner solid in ultra-thin films of cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2) at zero magnetic field. We show that a finite bias depins the domains and produces an unusually sharp threshold current-voltage behavior. Hysteresis and voltage fluctuations point to domain motion across the pinning potential and disappear at finite temperature as thermal fluctuations overcome the potential. The application of a small magnetic field destroys the Wigner solid, pointing to an unconventional origin. We use Landau level spectroscopy to show that the formation of the Wigner solid is closely connected to a topological transition as the film thickness is reduced.

# Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect

## 量子霍尔效应中的轴子暗物质和高原-高原跃迁

arXiv:2411.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.

# Exact linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems

## 无限扩展的费米子系统中宏观霍尔电流响应的精确线性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06967

arXiv:2411.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states (NEASS) approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_H$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance.
  A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.

arXiv:2411.07219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit all-to-all interactions that are traditionally used to generate such entangled states. Instead, we take advantage of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction native to most neutral atoms to realize spin-squeezed states. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using the finite-range spin exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope. We further propose and demonstrate that introducing atomic motion protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work's protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantum-enhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.

Abstract: The intriguing interplay between topology and superconductivity has attracted significant attention, given its potential for realizing topological superconductivity. In the quantum anomalous Hall insulators (QAHIs)-based junction, the supercurrents are carried by the chiral edge states, characterized by a $2\Phi_0$ magnetic flux periodicity ($\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is the flux quantum, $h$ the Planck constant, and $e$ the electron charge). However, experimental observations indicate the presence of bulk carriers in QAHI samples due to magnetic dopants. In this study, we reveal a systematic transition from edge-state to bulk-state dominant supercurrents as the chemical potential varies from the bulk gap to the conduction band. This results in an evolution from a $2\Phi_0$-periodic oscillation pattern to an asymmetric Fraunhofer pattern. Furthermore, a novel Fraunhoher-like pattern emerges due to the coexistence of chiral edge states and bulk states caused by magnetic {\color{black}domains}, even when the chemical potential resides within the gap. These findings not only advance the theoretical understanding but also pave the way for the experimental discovery of the chiral Josephson effect based on QAHI doped with magnetic impurities.

Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) refer to alloys composed of five or more elements in equal or near-equal amounts or in an atomic concentration range of 5 to 35 atomic percent (at%). Different elemental ratios will affect the microstructures of HEAs and provide them with unique properties. Based on past research, HEAs have exhibited superior performance, relative to most conventional alloys, with respect to many properties, such as strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, magnetic behavior, etc. Among them, fatigue behavior has been a topic of focus, due to its importance in industrial applications. In this article, we summarized the research progress in the HEA-fatigue behavior in the past ten years, including experimental results and theoretical studies in subdivisions, such as high-cycle fatigue, low-cycle fatigue, fatigue-crack growth, fatigue mechanisms, etc. The influence of the processing and test methods on HEAs is described. The accuracy of several commonly used prediction models is also outlined. Finally, unresolved issues and suggestions on the direction of future research efforts are presented.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive Fermi-liquid description for thermoelectric transport and current noise, applicable to multilevel quantum dots (QD) and magnetic alloys (MA) without electron-hole or time-reversal symmetry. Our formulation for the low-energy transport is based on an Anderson model with $N$ discrete impurity levels, and is asymptotically exact at low energies, up to the next-leading order terms in power expansions with respect to temperature $T$ and bias voltage $eV$. The expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms of the Fermi-liquid parameters, which include the three-body correlation functions defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state in addition to the linear susceptibilities and the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of impurity electrons. We apply this formulation to SU($N$) symmetric QD and MA, and calculate the correlation functions for $N=4$ and $6$, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The three-body correlations are shown to be determined by a single parameter over a wide range of electron fillings $1 \lesssim N_d^{} \lesssim N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions $U$, and they also exhibit the plateau structures due to the SU($N$) Kondo effects at integer values of $N_d^{}$. We find that the Lorenz number $L=\kappa/(T \sigma)$ for QD and MA, defined as the ratio of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ to the electrical conductivity $\sigma$, deviates from the universal Wiedemann-Franz value $\pi^2/(3e^2)$ as the temperature increases from $T=0$, showing the $T^2$ dependence, the coefficient for which depends on the three-body correlations away from half filling. We also demonstrate the role of three-body correlations on the nonlinear current noise and the other transport coefficients.

Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.

Abstract: In two dimensional magnets, the interplay of thermal fluctuations and spin anisotropy control the existence of long-range magnetic order. In the van der Waals antiferromagnets FePX$_3$, orbital degeneracy in the $t_{2g}$ levels of the Fe$^{2+}$ ions in octahedral coordination yields strong uniaxial anisotropy, which stabilizes magnetic order up to $T \approx 100$ K. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements around the magnetic ordering transition have shown the existence of a broad spectrum of magnetic fluctuations with nontrivial momentum dependence, what has been interpreted as evidence for localized entangled cluster excitations. In this paper, we offer an alternative interpretation using classical non-linear spin dynamics simulations. We present stochastic Landau Lifshitz dynamics simulations that reproduce the neutron scattering measurements of Chen et al. [1] on FePX$_3$. These calculations faithfully explain the dynamical structure factor's momentum and energy dependence and point to a classical origin for the excitations observed in neutron spectroscopy and that the order-disorder transition can be understood in terms of thermal fluctuations overcoming the anisotropy energy.

Abstract: Developing a comprehensive magnetic theory for correlated itinerant magnets poses challenges due to the difficulty in reconciling both local moments and itinerant electrons. In this work, we investigate the microscopic process of magnetic phase transition in ferromagnetic metal Fe$_{3-\delta}$GeTe$_2$. We find that Hund's coupling is crucial for establishing ferromagnetic order. During the ferromagnetic transition, we observe the formation of quasiparticle flat bands and an opposing tendency in spectral weight transfer, primarily between the lower and upper Hubbard bands, across the two spin channels. Moreover, our results indicate that one of the inequivalent Fe sites exhibits Mott physics, while the other Fe site exhibits Hund's physics, attributable to their distinct atomic environments. We suggest that ferromagnetic order reduces spin fluctuations and makes flat bands near the Fermi level more distinct. The hybridization between the distinctly flat bands and other itinerant bands offers a possible way to form heavy fermion behavior in ferromagnets. The complex interactions of competing orders drive correlated magnetic metals to a new frontier for discovering outstanding quantum states.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (DSMs) have been shown to exhibit one-dimensional hinge modes which are termed the higher-order hinge Fermi-arc (HOFA) states. They are the topological consequences of Dirac points. Superconducting states from Dirac semimetals can inherit the Dirac points to form nodal Dirac superconducting states, raising a question of whether there exists a topological superconducting bulk-hinge correspondence similar to DSMs. In this work, we discuss the nodal superconducting states from half-filled DSMs respecting non-magnetic (Type-II) Shubnikov space group (SSG) $P6/mmm1'$. We find that the BdG Dirac points can lead to higher-order topological Dirac superconducting (HOTDSC) states instead of the expected higher-order Majorana-arc (HOMA) states. The HOTDSC states can be regarded as a crossing between the HOFAs in normal states and the BdG shadow states. We demonstrate that HOTDSC states can be indicated by relative topologies of BdG Dirac points by utilizing the theory of magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC).

Abstract: By utilizing a multi-orbital periodic Anderson model with parameters obtained from \textit{ab initio} band structure calculations, combined with degenerate perturbation theory, we derive effective Kondo-Heisenberg and spin Hamiltonians that capture the interaction among the effective magnetic moments. This derivation encompasses fluctuations via both nonmagnetic $4f^0$ and magnetic $4f^2$ virtual states, and its accuracy is confirmed through comparison with experimental data obtained from CeIn$_3$. The significant agreement observed between experimental results and theoretical predictions underscores the potential of deriving minimal models from first-principles calculations for achieving a quantitative description of $4f$ materials. Moreover, our microscopic derivation unveils the underlying origin of anisotropy in the exchange interaction between Kramers doublets, shedding light on the conditions under which this anisotropy may be weak compared to the isotropic contribution.

Abstract: We study the optical response of the alternating twisted trilayer graphene by making use of a unitary transformation for the trilayer Hamiltonian and the Kubo formulation of linear response theory. The layer-resolved optical conductivities are expressed in terms of contributions from effective twisted bilayer and single-layer systems along with their coupling. We show that the in-plane magnetic response is proportional to this coupling between the twisted bilayer and single-layer systems; and, due to the different energy scales, the in-plane magnetic response is negligibly small. We also formulate a local electro-magnetic response that involves the vertical gradients of the magnetic field and moment.

Abstract: Clarifying the physical origin of valley polarization and exploring promising ferrovalley materials are conducive to the application of valley degrees of freedom in the field of information storage. Here, we explore two novel altermagnetic semiconductors (monolayers Nb2Se2O and Nb2SeTeO) with N\'eel temperature above room temperature based on first-principles calculations. It reveals that uniaxial strain induces valley polarization without spin-orbital coupling (SOC) in altermagnets owing to the piezovalley effect, while uniaxial compressive strain transforms the intrinsic ferrovalley semiconductor into a semimetal, half metal and metal. Moreover, moderate biaxial strain renders Janus monolayer Nb2SeTeO to robust Dirac-like band dispersion. The SOC and intrinsic in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy induce Dirac-like altermagnets to generate apparent valley polarization through magnetovalley coupling. In terms of SOC perturbation, we elucidate the physical mechanism behind in-plane-magnetization induced valley polarization and demonstrate the magnitude of valley polarization is positively correlated with the square of SOC strength and negatively correlated with the bandgap. The present work reveals the physical origin of valley polarization in altermagnets and expands the application of ferrovalley at room temperature in valleytronics.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for photonic technologies is the ability to control the confinement and propagation of light. Widely utilized platforms include two-dimensional (2D) optical microcavities in which electromagnetic waves are confined between either metallic or distributed Bragg reflectors. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides hosting tightly bound excitons with high optical quality have emerged as promising atomically thin mirrors. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a sub-wavelength 2D nano-cavity using two atomically thin mirrors with degenerate resonances. Angle-resolved measurements show a flat band, which sets this system apart from conventional photonic cavities. Remarkably, we demonstrate how the excitonic nature of the mirrors enables the formation of chiral and tunable optical modes upon the application of an external magnetic field. Moreover, we show the electrical tunability of the confined mode. Our work demonstrates a mechanism for confining light with high-quality excitonic materials, opening perspectives for spin-photon interfaces, and chiral cavity electrodynamics.

# A High-Power Microwave Limiter Using A Self-Actuated Plasma-Based EIT Topology

## 使用基于自驱动等离子体的EIT拓扑的高功率微波限制器

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05940

arXiv:2411.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel metamaterial topology incorporating gas discharge tubes for high-power microwave protection. The design features two split ring resonators positioned side by side with their splits oriented orthogonally. When exposed to low-power microwaves, each split ring resonator induces a resonance that interacts to create a passband within a broad stopband, facilitated by a phenomenon known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). At high power levels, the integrated gas discharge tubes become ionized, forming plasma that acts as a switch to eliminate the EIT window, thereby reinstating the stopband for protection. Several prototypes have been developed for S-band operation based on this concept. Analytical, numerical, and experimental results are in complete agreement. The proposed device demonstrates superior protection with lower insertion loss in the OFF mode and higher isolation in the ON mode. Its strong ability to handle high-power microwaves is achieved using plasma-based switches instead of diodes, providing a reasonable response time and a straightforward design that enables rapid prototyping. Additionally, the device demonstrates frequency and power threshold tunability, highlighting its versatility as a microwave protection device.

arXiv:2411.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical and simulation study of twisted terahertz (THz) radiation generation via propagation of a circularly polarized Laguerre Gaussian (LG) laser pulse in homogeneous plasma embedded in an axial magnetic field. Analytical formulation is based on perturbation technique and quasistatic approximation. Longitudinal and transverse wakefields generated via laser plasma interactions are evaluated using Lorentz force and Maxwells equations in the mildly nonlinear regime. It is observed that two linearly polarized twisted terahertz (THz) radiation beams are generated in mutually perpendicular planes. Superposition of the two beams result in a single linearly polarized twisted THz radiation beam with modified amplitude and polarization direction. Three dimensional (3D) particle in cell (PIC) simulations are performed for this configuration using FBPIC code. Graphical comparison of amplitude of the resultant THz beam obtained via analytical and simulation studies is presented.

# Temperature Relaxation Rates in Strongly Magnetized Plasmas

## 强磁化等离子体中的温度弛豫率

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06521

arXiv:2411.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly magnetized plasmas, characterized by having a gyrofrequency larger than the plasma frequency ($\beta = \omega_c/\omega_p \gg 1$), are known to exhibit novel transport properties. Previous works studying pure electron plasmas have shown that strong magnetization significantly inhibits energy exchange between parallel and perpendicular directions, leading to a prolonged time for relaxation of a temperature anisotropy. Recent work studying repulsive electron-ion interactions showed that strong magnetization increases both the parallel and perpendicular temperature relaxation rates of ions, but in differing magnitudes, resulting in the formation of temperature anisotropy during equilibration. This previous study treated electrons as a heat bath and assumed weak magnetization of ions. Here, we broaden this analysis and compute the full temperature and temperature anisotropy evolution over a broad range of magnetic field strengths. It is found that when electrons are strongly magnetized ($\beta_e \gg 1$) and ions are weakly magnetized ($\beta_i \ll 1$), the magnetic field strongly suppresses the perpendicular energy exchange rate of electrons, whereas the parallel exchange rate slightly increases in magnitude compared to the value at weak magnetization. In contrast, the ion perpendicular and parallel energy exchange rates both increase in magnitude compared to the values at weak magnetization. Consequently, equilibration causes the electron parallel temperature to rapidly align with the ion temperature, while the electron perpendicular temperature changes much more slowly. It is also shown that when both ions and electrons are strongly magnetized ($\beta_i, \beta_e \gg 1$) the ion-electron perpendicular relaxation rate dramatically decreases with magnetization strength as well.

# Time delay estimation of coherent structure velocities from a super-position of localized pulses

arXiv:2411.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a novel method for estimating two-dimensional velocities using coarse-grained imaging data, which is particularly relevant for applications in plasma diagnostics. The method utilizes measurements from three non-collinear points and is derived from a stochastic model that describes the propagation of uncorrelated pulses through two-dimensional space. This model builds upon a well-studied one-dimensional model used to analyze turbulence in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined plasmas. We demonstrate that the method provides exact time delay estimates when applied to a superposition of Gaussian structures and remains accurate for various other pulse functions. Through extensive numerical simulations, we evaluate the method's performance under different conditions, including variations in signal duration, pulse overlap, spatial and temporal resolution, and the presence of additive noise. Additionally, we investigate the impact of temporal pulse evolution due to linear damping and explore the so-called barberpole effect, which occurs with elongated and tilted structures. Our analysis reveals that the three-point method effectively addresses the limitations encountered with two-point techniques, particularly at coarse spatial resolutions. Although the method is susceptible to the barberpole effect, we analytically demonstrate that this effect does not occur when the elongated structures propagate parallel to one of their axes, and we establish bounds for the associated errors. Overall, our findings provide a comprehensive and robust framework for accurate two-dimensional velocity estimation, enhancing the capabilities of fusion plasma diagnostics and potentially benefiting other fields requiring precise motion analysis.

# Integrated modelling of equilibrium and transport in axisymmetric magnetic mirror fusion devices

arXiv:2411.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Hammir tandem mirror design based on Realta Fusion's first-of-a-kind model for axisymmetric magnetic mirror fusion performance. This model uses an integrated end plug simulation model including, heating, equilibrium, and transport combined with a new formulation of the plasma operation contours (POPCONs) technique for the tandem mirror central cell. Using this model, it is shown that an end plug utilizing high temperature superconducting magnets and modern neutral beams enables a classical tandem mirror pilot plant producing a fusion gain Q > 5. The approach here represents an important advance in tandem mirror design. The high fidelity end plug model enables calculations of heating and transport in the highly non-Maxwellian end plug to be made more accurately and the central cell POPCON technique allows consideration of a wide range of parameters in the relatively simple near-Maxwellian central cell, facilitating the selection of more optimal central cell plasmas. These advances make it possible to find more conservative classical tandem mirror fusion pilot plant operating points with lower $\beta$, temperatures, neutral beam energies, and end plug performance than designs in the literature. Despite being more conservative, it is shown that these operating points can still form the basis of a viable fusion pilot plant.

Abstract: Single-particle orbits are investigated as the basis of a coherent kinetic theory. Analytic solutions including azimuthal circulation are obtained in elliptic functions, of which ideal cyclotron and betatron motions are limiting solutions. The elliptic modulus depends on a trapping parameter and an axis-encircling to axial-drift kinetic energy ratio. Large trapping parameters limit to guiding-center cyclotron motion, while small trapping parameters describe ideal betatron motion. The analytic solutions inform a separation of phase space into trapped and passing trajectories, with which the Bennett solution is decomposed into cyclotron and betatron distributions. The two partial densities are computed to reveal a transitional magnetization layer the extent of which depends only on an ensemble-averaged trapping parameter, equivalent to: the Budker parameter, the pinch-to-Alfv\'{e}n current ratio, the Larmor radius parameter squared, the Hall parameter squared, the drift parameter squared, and the Hartmann number squared. The interplay of diamagnetic current and axial betatron flux is clarified through partial current densities, and the radial electric fields of shear flows are observed to influence ion orbits particularly around unity Budker parameter.

arXiv:2411.06674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic compression of a self-magnetizing current filament (a Z pinch) is analyzed via the adiabatic invariants of its constituent cyclotron and betatron motions. Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) models are recovered for both trajectories but with distinct anisotropy axes, about the magnetic field for cyclotron fluid and about the electric current for betatron fluid. In particular, betatron heating produces agyrotropic anisotropy which balances with gyrophase mixing. A hybrid CGL model is proposed based on the local densities of cyclotron and betatron orbits, then validated by numerical experiments. The relation between anisotropy and shear is explored by constructing the kinetic equilibrium of a flow expanded in the flux function. Flow as a linear flux function is simply bi-Maxwellian, while higher powers display higher-moment deviations. Next, weakly collisional gyroviscosity (magnetized pressure-strain) is considered in a forward process (forced flow) and an inverse process (forced anisotropy). The forward process phase-mixes flow into a simple flux function, freezing flow into flux and inducing anisotropy. In the inverse process, betatron heating-induced anisotropy self-generates a sheared flow to resist changes in flux. This flow, arising from momentum diffusion, is concentrated in the betatron region.

Abstract: Portable, low-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners are increasingly being deployed in clinical settings. However, critical barriers to their widespread use include low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), generally low image quality, and long scan duration. As these systems can operate in unusual environments, the level and spectral characteristics of the environmental electromagnetic inference (EMI) noise can change substantially across sites and scans, further reducing image quality. Methods for accelerating acquisition and boosting image quality are of critical importance to enable clinically actionable high-quality imaging in these systems. Despite the role that compressed sensing (CS) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have had in improving image quality for high-field MRI, their adoption for low-field imaging is in its infancy, and it is unclear how robust these methods are in low SNR regimes. Here, we investigate and compare leading CS and AI-based methods for image reconstruction from subsampled data and perform a thorough analysis of their performance across a range of SNR values. We compare classical L1-wavelet CS with leading data-driven and model-driven AI methods. Experiments are performed using publicly available datasets and our own low-field and high-field experimental data. Specifically, we apply an unrolled AI network to low-field MRI, and find it outperforms competing reconstruction methods. We prospectively deploy our undersampling methods to accelerate imaging on a 6.5 mT MRI scanner. This work highlights the potential and pitfalls of advanced reconstruction techniques in low-field MRI, paving the way for broader clinical applications.

Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.

Abstract: Yttrium calcium aluminate, with the formula CaYAl3O7, has been extensively researched due to its remarkable luminescent properties when doped or co-doped. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional piezoelectric properties at high temperatures. However, the potential magnetic properties this material can acquire through doping or co-doping have largely gone unexplored until now. In this innovative study, we investigate the quantum magnetic characteristics of yttrium calcium aluminate particles doped with transition metals such as cobalt, iron, and nickel. Our magnetic measurements of hysteresis curves in the macroscopic regime reveal intriguing magnetic characteristics that have not been documented in the literature. Given the high applicability of this material in biological microelectromechanical systems, we conducted a detailed study to demonstrate these findings.

Abstract: Layertronics that manifests layer Hall effect is typically considered to intrinsically possess binary physics. Using symmetry arguments and a low-energy kp model, we show that the layer physics in layertronics can be engineered into quaternary mode, giving rise to the concept of quadri-layertronics. The mechanism correlates to the interplay between out-of-plane ferroelectricity and valley physics in antiferromagnetic multiferroic quadrilayer, which enables the layer-locked Berry curvature and Hall effect, i.e., deflecting the carriers with four different layer physics to move in specific directions. More importantly, the quadri-layertronics can be generated and manipulated by controlling the interlayer dipole arrangements via a gate voltage, allowing for the selective induction and detection of layer Hall effect in specific layers. Using first principles calculations, we further demonstrate the gate control of quadri-layertronics in multiferroic antiferromagnet of quadrilayer OsCl2. These explored phenomena and insights greatly enrich the research on layertronics.

Abstract: In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that space weather disturbances can be triggered by transient upstream mesoscale structures (TUMS), independently of the occurrence of large-scale solar wind (SW) structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Different types of magnetospheric pulsations, transient perturbations of the geomagnetic field and auroral structures are often observed during times when SW monitors indicate quiet conditions, and have been found to be associated to TUMS. In this mini-review we describe the space weather phenomena that have been associated with four of the largest-scale and the most energetic TUMS, namely hot flow anomalies, foreshock bubbles, travelling foreshocks and foreshock compressional boundaries. The space weather phenomena associated with TUMS tend to be more localized and less intense compared to geomagnetic storms. However, the quiet time space weather may occur more often since, especially during solar minima, quiet SW periods prevail over the perturbed times.

Abstract: Microrobots engineered from self-propelling active particles, extend the reach of robotic operations to submillimeter dimensions and are becoming increasingly relevant for various tasks, such as manipulation of micro/nanoscale cargo, particularly targeted drug delivery. However, achieving deep-tissue penetration and drug delivery remain a challenge. This work developed a novel biohybrid microrobot consisting of jellyfish stinging capsules, which act as natural nanoinjectors for efficient penetration and delivery, assembled onto an active Janus particle (JP). While microrobot transport and navigation was externally controlled by magnetic field-induced rolling, capsule loading onto the JP surface was controlled by electric field. Following precise navigation of the biohybrid microrobots to the vicinity of target tissues, the capsules were activated by a specific enzyme introduced to the solution, which then triggered tubule ejection and release of the preloaded molecules. Use of such microrobots for penetration of and delivery of the preloaded drug/toxin to targeted cancer spheroids and live Caenorhabditis elegans was demonstrated in-vitro. The findings offer insights for future development of bio-inspired microrobots capable of deep penetration and drug delivery. Future directions may involve encapsulation of various drugs within different capsule types for enhanced versatility. This study may also inspire in-vivo applications involving deep tissue drug delivery.

arXiv:2411.07219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit all-to-all interactions that are traditionally used to generate such entangled states. Instead, we take advantage of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction native to most neutral atoms to realize spin-squeezed states. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using the finite-range spin exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope. We further propose and demonstrate that introducing atomic motion protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work's protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantum-enhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.

Moreover, we show the electrical tunability of the confined mode. Our work demonstrates a mechanism for confining light with high-quality excitonic materials, opening perspectives for spin-photon interfaces, and chiral cavity electrodynamics.

It was tested both inside a strong magnetic field up to 1.6 T and at cryogenic temperatures down to 35K. The measurements of the velocity and positioning accuracy of the disk are shown and are found to match the MADMAX requirements.

Abstract: Investigating the interactions of vortex electrons with electromagnetic fields is crucial for advancing particle acceleration techniques, scattering theory in background fields, and developing novel electron beams for material diagnostics. In this work, we systematically study the dynamics of relativistic vortex electrons during their head-on collisions with linearly polarized (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) laser pulses, as well as their superposition. We develop a theoretical framework using Volkov-Bessel wave functions to describe the spatiotemporal characteristics of vortex electrons in these external fields. We show that the beam center of the vortex electron follows the classical trajectory of a point-charge electron while maintaining the transverse structure of both vortex eigenstates and superposition states. Specifically, CP laser pulses cause the beam center to rotate, while LP laser pulses induce a lateral shift. The combined effect of LP and CP laser pulses in a two-mode field results in a twisted spiral pattern. Our findings demonstrate the potential for versatile control of vortex electron beams using various laser modes, providing a foundation for future experimental and theoretical studies. This work serves as a benchmark reference for investigations into the manipulation of vortex electron beams using more realistic laser or other types of external fields.

Abstract: Using time as an additional design parameter in electromagnetism, photonics, and wave physics is attracting considerable research interest, motivated by the possibility to explore physical phenomena and engineering opportunities beyond the physical limits of time-invariant systems. However, despite substantial theoretical promise, the practical realization and observation of many new effects and capabilities leveraging such temporal degrees of freedom have remained elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of enhanced broadband absorption of electromagnetic waves in a continuously modulated time-varying system, exceeding one of the key theoretical limits of linear time-invariant absorbers. This is achieved by harnessing the frequency-wavevector transitions and enhanced interference effects enabled by breaking both continuous space- and time-translation symmetries in a periodically time-modulated absorbing structure operating at radio-frequencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate broadband coherent wave absorption using a secondary control wave, observing a nearly perfect, reconfigurable, anti-reflection effect over a broad continuous bandwidth. Our findings provide new insights to challenge existing paradigms on the limits of wave absorption and may pave the way to the development of devices that operate in a regime fundamentally beyond the reach of any linear time-invariant system.

Abstract: Clarifying the physical origin of valley polarization and exploring promising ferrovalley materials are conducive to the application of valley degrees of freedom in the field of information storage. Here, we explore two novel altermagnetic semiconductors (monolayers Nb2Se2O and Nb2SeTeO) with N\'eel temperature above room temperature based on first-principles calculations. It reveals that uniaxial strain induces valley polarization without spin-orbital coupling (SOC) in altermagnets owing to the piezovalley effect, while uniaxial compressive strain transforms the intrinsic ferrovalley semiconductor into a semimetal, half metal and metal. Moreover, moderate biaxial strain renders Janus monolayer Nb2SeTeO to robust Dirac-like band dispersion. The SOC and intrinsic in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy induce Dirac-like altermagnets to generate apparent valley polarization through magnetovalley coupling. In terms of SOC perturbation, we elucidate the physical mechanism behind in-plane-magnetization induced valley polarization and demonstrate the magnitude of valley polarization is positively correlated with the square of SOC strength and negatively correlated with the bandgap. The present work reveals the physical origin of valley polarization in altermagnets and expands the application of ferrovalley at room temperature in valleytronics.

# Observation of surface Fermi arcs in altermagnetic Weyl semimetal CrSb

As a special type of collinear antiferromagnetism (AFM), altermagnetism has garnered significant research interest recently. Altermagnets exhibit broken parity-time symmetry and zero net magnetization in real space, leading to substantial band splitting in momentum space even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Meanwhile, parity-time symmetry breaking always induce nontrivial band topology such as Weyl nodes. While Weyl semimetal states and nodal lines have been theoretically proposed in altermagnets, rare reports of experimental observation have been made up to this point. Using ARPES and first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the electronic structure of the room-temperature altermagnet candidate CrSb. At generic locations in momentum space, we clearly observed band spin splitting. Furthermore, we identified discrete surface Fermi arcs on the (100) cleaved side surface close to the Fermi level originating from bulk band topology. Our results imply that CrSb contains interesting nontrivial topological Weyl physics, in addition to being an excellent room temperature altermagnet.

In order to establish a shape- properties integrated digital twin framework for magnetic field assisted electrical discharge machining (MF-WEDM), this study developed a multi-scale wettability simulation model based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), which directly correlates micro-morphological parameters of the surface with performance metrics, thereby enabling the direct simulation of virtual surface properties. Secondly, the influences of the virtual surface roughness and waviness on the antenna of MF-WEDM were studied for the first time by using the constructed multiphase flow model, which provided a foundational basis for optimizing both process and texture parameters. Then the texture surface with orthogonal geometric parameters was designed and its wetting characteristics were simulated. The geometric parameters of the texture were optimized according to the simulation results of contact angle (CA) and wetting state. Finally, a superhydrophobic surface with hierarchical structure was fabricated using MF-WEDM process in one step, and the simulation results were validated. The research results indicate that the unique rough surface formed by MF-WEDM can enhance the CA of TC4 surface from 79&amp;deg; to 113&amp;deg;, while appropriately designed submillimeter micro-grooves can further increase it to 151.3&amp;deg;, accompanied by a sliding angle (SA) of 8.6&amp;deg; as measured using small droplets (5 &amp;micro;L). the wetting states obtained from both LBM simulations and experiments are in complete agreement, with average error of only 1.3&amp;deg; and standard deviation of 4.6&amp;deg; for the CA. The developed all-digital model can directly realize the unique surface function in the cutting and forming process of parts, and has an important reference for the efficient preparation of functional surfaces.

The thermomagnetic, electronic, structural, and mechanical properties of the Fe2MnAs1&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;xSix (x&thinsp;=&thinsp;0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0) full Heusler alloys were investigated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCs) and density functional theory (DFT). Both the pure and doped structures exhibit the L21 prototype, and there is a noticeable decline in the lattice parameter as the Si concentration increases. Electronic analysis was performed using Wien2k and the calculations were conducted using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method implementing various approximations including GGA-PBE, mBJ-GGA, GGA&thinsp;+&thinsp;U, and PBEsol (GGAsol). Studying exchange coupling parameters revealed that ferromagnetic states primarily arise from the interactions between Fe-Mn and Fe&ndash;Fe in both pure and doped structures. The resultant Curie temperature ranged from 215 K to 490 K by investigating the magnetic properties. Additionally, different mechanical properties such as Poisson&rsquo;s ratio, linear compressibility, anisotropy parameter, shear, bulk, and Young&rsquo;s modulus were examined for all the structures.

We use ultrafast x-ray diffraction to study non-equilibrium pathways of the phase transition in FeRh parametrized by the structural response. By increasing the pump-pulse duration beyond the electron-phonon coupling time, we suppress the electron-phonon non-equilibrium present upon femtosecond laser excitation but still photoexcite electrons to non-thermal states. Irrespective of the pump pulse duration, we find an optically induced nucleation of ferromagnetic domains on an 8 ps timescale that starts as soon as the successively deposited energy surpasses the site-specific threshold energy. If in contrast, FeRh is only indirectly excited by diffusion of thermalized electrons from an opaque Pt cap layer, the ferromagnetic phase rises on a 50 ps timescale. These findings unambiguously identify the photo-excitation of non-thermal electrons and not electron-phonon non-equilibria to enable the non-equilibrium pathway of the phase transition in FeRh.
