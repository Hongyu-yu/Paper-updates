# Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator

## 在基于原子的量子模拟器中测量霍尔电压和霍尔电阻

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09744

arXiv:2411.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hall effect has a paramount role in a wide range of disciplines, from applied sciences to the fundamental exploration of novel topological phases of matter. In the solid state, this effect describes the emergence of a voltage drop perpendicular to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Despite its fundamental nature, a full understanding and control of the Hall effect in interacting quantum systems is still lacking. This has led to the development of quantum simulators based on neutral atoms, where strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect were recently unveiled. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in those systems was not achieved so far. Here, we demonstrate a technique for the measurement of the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a non-electron-based system and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analog quantum simulations and measurements performed in real solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.

# Coherent Magneto-Conductance Oscillations in Amorphous Topological Insulator Nanowires

## 非晶拓扑绝缘体纳米线中的相干磁导振荡

arXiv:2411.09754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on amorphous materials have established the existence of surface states similar to those of crystalline three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs). Amorphous topological insulators are also independently of interest for thermo-electric and other properties. To develop an understanding of transport in these systems, we carry out quantum transport calculations for a tight-binding model of an amorphous nano-wire pierced by an axial magnetic flux, then compare the results to known features in the case of crystalline models with disorder. Our calculations complement previous studies in the crystalline case that studied the surface or used a Green's function method. We find that the periodicity of the conductance signal with varying magnetic flux is comparable to the crystalline case, with maxima occurring at odd multiples of magnetic flux quanta. However, the expected amplitude of the oscillation decreases with increasing amorphousness, as defined and described in the main text. We characterize this deviation from the crystalline case by taking ensemble averages of the conductance signatures for various wires with measurements simulated at finite temperatures. This striking transport phenomenon offers a metric to characterize amorphous TIs and stimulate further experiments on this class of materials.

# An EFT for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets: gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones, and phase transitions

arXiv:2411.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build and discuss a low energy effective field theory for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets in presence of an external magnetic field. Such an effective theory is simple yet rich, and features a number of phenomena such as the appearance of gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones and a "spin flop" phase transition, all within the regime of validity of the theory. We also discuss in detail, the quantization procedure of the free theory in the presence of a magnetic field, which is made non-trivial by the presence of a single-time derivative term. This class of materials make a precious test field for exotic phenomena in quantum field theory. Moreover, we explicitly perform the matching of the effective theory to the short distance theory of a specific anti-ferromagnet, namely, nickel oxide. The latter is particularly relevant in light of recent proposals of employing this material towards the hunt for light dark matter. As a byproduct of our study, we also re-evaluate the role played by discrete symmetries in magnetic materials, presenting it in a way that is completely consistent with the proper low energy EFT ideology.

# Large critical fields in superconducting Ti$_{4}$Ir$_2$O from spin-orbit coupling

## 自旋轨道耦合在超导Ti $_{ 4}$ I r $_2 $ O中的大临界场

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09793

arXiv:2411.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently synthesized $\eta$-carbide-type superconductors exhibit large critical fields. A notable example is Ti$_4$Ir$_2$O, for which the upper critical field strongly violates the Pauli paramagnetic limit, behavior that is unusual for cubic materials that preserve inversion symmetry. Here, by combining density functional theory (DFT) and analytic modeling, we provide an explanation for this enhanced Pauli limiting field. We show that the nonsymmorphic Fd$\overline{3}$m symmetry implies that the electronic states near the X points exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which leads to a vanishing effective $g$-factor and enables the enhanced Pauli limiting field. Furthermore, our DFT results reveal a Van Hove singularity (VHS) peak near the X points, accounting for $\sim$65\% of the total density of states (DOS), occurring near the chemical potential. We propose that the strong SOC and enhanced DOS in the vicinity of the X points provide the origin of the observed enhanced critical field. This leads to a prediction that the magnetic field will lead to a strongly momentum-dependent gap suppression. The gap due to electronic states away from (near to) the X points will be rapidly (slowly) suppressed by fields.

# Entangling color centers via magnon-antimagnon pair creation

## 通过magnon-antimagnon对创建纠缠色心

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09865

arXiv:2411.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present how entanglement between a spatially separated pair of color centers can be created by letting them weakly interact with the quantum fluctuations of a nonequilibrium magnetic environment. To this end, we consider two coupled ferromagnets, one in the ground state and one in an inverted state with respect to an applied magnetic field. The resulting energetic instability leads to a quantum spin current in the vacuum state that is sustained by the creation of magnon-antimagnon pairs at the interface. We show that these quantum fluctuations imprint a steady-state entanglement onto the two dipole-coupled color centers through nonlocal dissipation. We derive conditions for establishing a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is absent in thermal equilibrium.

arXiv:2411.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent studies have revealed cone spin continuum in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also accords with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance. These results provide further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.

Abstract: The consecutive magnetic ordering of the Ho and Ru ions in the pyrochlore Ho2Ru2O7 and their interplay are investigated by neutron scattering, magnetic and specific heat measurements. The Ru magnetic moments order at 95 K into an easy-plane antiferromagnetic state, while the Ho moments order at 1.55 K into an unsaturated ferromagnetic state that retains an extensive ground state entropy and present complex spin dynamics throughout the low temperature phase. These unexpected features are analyzed in terms of a fragmented ferromagnetic state equivalent to the pyrochlore kagome ice. Selection of this unusual state relies on a subtle compromise between long-range ferromagnetic interactions between holmium moments and a repulsive cubic field, both mediated by the ruthenium lattice.

arXiv:2411.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the altermagnets, a new kind of colinear antiferromagnet with zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin-splitting of bands, have sparked great interest. Despite simple magnetic structures, these altermagnets exhibit intriguing and intricate dependence of AHE on the N\'eel vector, in contrast to the conventional perpendicular configuration of Hall current with magnetization in ferromagnets. However, the relationship between the AHE and the N\'eel vector remains largely elusive. Here, we propose an "extrinsic parameter" method and further reveal diverse unconventional anomalous Hall textures in the N\'eel vector space, dubbed anomalous-Hall N\'eel textures (AHNTs), for altermagnets. Notably, we find that AHNTs resemble the spin textures in momentum space, and identify 10 types across four categories of AHNTs in altermagnets. Meanwhile, we examine our key discoveries in prototypical altermagnets. Our work can offer a methodology for detecting N\'eel vectors via anomalous Hall transport, and provide useful guidelines for designing electronic and optoelectronic devices based on altermagnets.

arXiv:2411.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ices provide a controlled platform for investigating diverse physical phenomena, such as geometric frustration, magnetic monopoles, and phase transitions, via deliberate design. Here, we introduce a novel approach by developing artificial spin ice on the surfaces of a three-dimensional cube, which leads to emergent geometric frustration mediated by topologically protected domain walls, distinct from its flat counterparts. These domain walls connect vertices at the corners of cube that acting as intrinsic topological defects. Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we observe robust, topologically protected correlations among the intrinsic topological defects, regardless of their spatial separation. Our findings demonstrate that three-dimensional surfaces can unveil emergent properties absent in flat architectures.

arXiv:2411.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Josephson vortices in planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, where the TI section is narrow and long. We are motivated by recent experiments, especially by those in junctions of Corbino ring geometry, where non-zero critical current was observed at low temperatures even if a non-zero phase winding number (fluxoid) was enforced in the ring by the perpendicular magnetic field. In this paper we focus on the "atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit we can associate the non-vanishing critical current with the irregularities (disorder) in the junction's width. We also discuss the microwave spectroscopy of the Josephson vortices in the atomic limit and observe particularly simple selection rules for the allowed transitions.

Abstract: This study investigates methods for controlling the physical properties of the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) by substituting Mn with Pb in Mn$_{1-x}$Pb$_x$Bi$_2$Te$_4$ (MPBT) solid solutions. This substitution enables tunable magnetic and electronic properties. Using various angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) techniques, including spin-resolved and circular dichroism (CD) measurements, we analyzed the evolution of the electronic structure across different Pb concentrations, with a focus on topological phase transitions (TPT) near x = 50 %. Key indicators of TPT include the presence or absence of topological surface states (TSS) and bulk band gap closure. The results show a gradual decrease of the bulk band gap in the electronic structure of MPBT up to x = 40 %, where it nearly vanishes, followed by a constant gap value between 40 - 60 %, and its reopening above 80 %, which is accompanied by a transition of the electronic structure of MPBT to a PbBi$_2$Te$_4$-like electronic structure. TSS were observed at x less than 30 % and greater than 80 %, as confirmed by CD and spin-resolved ARPES data, but were absent near x = 55 %, suggesting a distinct topological phase - possibly semi-metallic or a trivial insulator with a narrow gap phase. These findings demonstrate the tunability of the electronic structure of MPBT, making it a promising candidate for topological and spintronic applications.

arXiv:2411.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $6 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.

# Inverse Melting of Polar Order in a Ferroelectric Oxide

## 铁电氧化物中极性顺序的反向熔化

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10445

arXiv:2411.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many condensed matter systems, long range order emerges at low temperatures as thermal fluctuations subside. In the presence of competing interactions or quenched disorder, however, some systems can show unusual configurations that become more disordered at low temperature, a rare phenomenon known as "inverse melting". Here, we discover an inverse melting of the polar order in a ferroelectric oxide with quenched chemical disorder (BaTi1-xZrxO3) through direct atomic-scale visualization using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. In contrast to the clean BaTiO3 parent system in which long range order tracks lower temperatures, we observe in the doped system BaTi1-xZrxO3 that thermally driven fluctuations at high temperature give way to a more ordered state and then to a re-entrant disordered configuration at even lower temperature. Such an inverse melting of the polar order is likely linked to the random field generated by Zr dopants, which modulates the energy landscape arising from the competition between thermal fluctuations and random field pinning potential. These visualizations highlight a rich landscape of order and disorder in materials with quenched disorder, which may be key to understanding their advanced functionalities.

Abstract: The dislocation created in the topological material lays the foundation of many significant findings to control light but requires delicate fabrication of the material. To extend its flexibility and reconfigurability, we propose the magnetic dislocation concept and unveil its properties in a representative model, which effectively combines the topological defect and edge mode at the magnetic domain wall. The results include distinct localization modes and robust light trapping phenomena with the rainbow feature where the eigen-energy of each light-trapping state can be linearly tuned by the magnetic dislocation. The conversion from the trapping state to edge modes can be harnessed by further adiabatically pumping light across an amount of the magnitude of the magnetic dislocation. Our work solves a fundamental problem by introducing magnetic dislocation with new light-manipulation flexibility, which may be implemented in a variety of platforms in photonic, acoustics, and optomechanics with dynamic modulations and synthetic dimensions.

# Nonresonant Raman control of material phases

## 材料相的非共振拉曼控制

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10131

arXiv:2411.10131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Important advances have recently been made in the search for materials with complex multi-phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light-matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above-bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes has been experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion has been limited to perturbative levels. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to overcome this challenge by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid-infrared pulses, we induce ferroelectric reversal in lithium niobate and phase switching in tin selenide and characterize the large-amplitude mode displacements through femtosecond Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and x-ray diffraction. This approach, validated by first-principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast speeds.

Abstract: Experimental efforts on topological superconductivity (TSC) have primarily focused on the detection of Majorana boundary modes, while the bulk properties of TSC - particularly in two dimensions (2D) - remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we theoretically propose a distinctive signature in the spectral function away from the boundaries, capable of detecting 2D chiral p-wave TSC induced in a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) heterostructure. This signature can be probed experimentally through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or momentum- and energy-resolved tunneling spectroscopy (MERTS) under a weak magnetic field B. We show that within the topological phase, the spectral intensity of the lowest superconducting band at small momenta k~0 brightens linearly with increasing B, whereas it darkens in the trivial phase. This sharp contrast arises from the phase-space Berry curvature (BC) of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, a novel quantum geometric property that generalizes the conventional momentum-space BC. The effect of this phase-space BC can also be detected by the differential conductance away from the boundaries. Our falsifiable prediction provides a new experimental avenue for detecting Rashba-induced chiral p-wave TSC without relying on Majorana mode detection, addressing a key challenge in the realization of 2D TSC.

Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), a newly discovered magnetic state, ingeniously integrates the properties of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, representing a significant breakthrough in the field of magnetic materials. Despite experimental verification of some typical AM materials, such as MnTe and MnTe$_2$, the pursuit of AM materials that feature larger spin splitting and higher transition temperature is still essential. Here, our research focuses on CrSb, which possesses N{\'e}el temperature of up to 700K and giant spin splitting near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Utilizing high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we meticulously map the three-dimensional electronic structure of CrSb. Our photoemission spectroscopic results on both (0001) and (10$\overline{1}$0) cleavages of CrSb collaboratively reveal unprecedented details on AM-induced band splitting, and subsequently pin down its unique bulk $g$-wave symmetry through quantitative analysis of the angular and photon-energy dependence of spin splitting. Moreover, the observed spin splitting reaches the magnitude of 0.93~eV near $E_F$, the most substantial among all confirmed AM materials. This study not only validates the nature of CrSb as a prototype $g$-wave like AM material but also underscores its pivotal role in pioneering applications in spintronics.

Abstract: We study the influence of the quantum geometry on the magnetic responses of quadratic band crossing semimetals. More explicitly, we examine the Landau levels, quantum Hall effect, and magnetic susceptibility of a general two-band Hamiltonian that has fixed isotropic quadratic band dispersion but with tunable quantum geometry, in which the interband coupling is fully characterized by the maximum quantum distance $d_\mathrm{max}$. By continuously tuning $d_\mathrm{max}$ in the range of $0\leq d_\mathrm{max}\leq 1$, we investigate how the magnetic properties of the free electron model with $d_\mathrm{max}=0$ evolve into those of the bilayer graphene with $d_\mathrm{max}=1$. We demonstrate that despite sharing the same energy dispersion $\epsilon(p) =\pm\frac{p^2}{2m}$, the charge carriers in the free electron model and bilayer graphene exhibit entirely distinct Landau levels and quantum Hall responses due to the nontrivial quantum geometry of the wave functions.

Abstract: Floating edge bands (FEB) have been identified in systems such as obstructed atomic insulators and layered nonsymmorphic semimetals, attracting considerable interest recently. Here we demonstrate that FEB can arise in a simplified model incorporating altermagnetism. By enhancing the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model on a square lattice with additional altermagnetic and Zeeman fields perpendicular to the 2D plane, we uncover the emergence of FEB that are distinct from the bulk bands across the entire Brillouin zone and over broad parameter regimes. We calculate topological phase diagrams, highlighting the strong topological properties characterized by the Chern number and the weak topological properties marked by the winding number. Furthermore, we provide analytical results of the energy spectrum and the wave functions of the FEB. We also study the robustness of the FEB, showcasing its resilience against various perturbations such as geometric rotation, energy spectrum asymmetry, and spin coupling. Our findings advance our understanding of FEB and may pave new avenues for further exploration of topological phases in quantum materials.

Abstract: Using density-functional theory, we demonstrate that the formal layer charges of the metallic samarium nickelate electrode influence the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of the barium titanate in SmNiO$_3$/BaTiO$_3$ capacitors. We find that, despite the metallic screening of SmNiO$_3$, the spontaneous polarization of BaTiO$_3$ always aligns with the layer polarization of the SmNiO$_3$ formal charges. We also find zero critical thickness for the ferroelectricity in BaTiO$_3$ in this orientation. The opposite polarization direction is highly disfavored for thin BaTiO$_3$ slabs but becomes less unstable with increasing slab thickness. We construct a simple electrostatic model that allows us both to study the behavior for thicker BaTiO$_3$ and SmNiO$_3$ slabs and to extract the influence of various material parameters on the behavior. We mimic a metal-insulator transition in the SmNiO$_3$ by varying the metallic screening length, which we find greatly influences the stability of the ferroelectric polarization. Our results show that the layer charges in the metal electrodes strongly influence the properties in ferroelectric capacitors and in fact can provide new ways to control the ferroelectric properties.

Abstract: Superconducting memory is a promising technology for data storage because of its speed, high energy efficiency, non-volatility, and compatibility with quantum computing devices. However, the need for cryogenic temperatures makes superconducting memory an extremely expensive and specialized device. Ternary lanthanum polyhydrides, due to their high critical temperatures of 240-250 K, represent a convenient platform for studying effects associated with superconductivity in disordered granular systems. In this work, we investigate a trapped magnetic flux and memory effects in recently discovered lanthanum-neodymium (La,Nd)H$_{10}$ and lanthanum-scandium (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ superhydrides at a pressure of 175-196 GPa. We use a steady magnetic field of a few Tesla (T) and strong pulsed fields up to 68 T to create the trapped flux state in the compressed superhydrides. We find a clockwise hysteresis of magnetoresistance in cerium CeH$_{9-10}$ and lanthanum-cerium (La,Ce)H$_{10+x}$ polyhydrides, a characteristic feature of granular superconductors. A study of the current-voltage characteristics and voltage-temperature curves of the samples with frozen magnetic flux indicates a significant memory effect in La-Sc polyhydrides already at 225-230 K.

Abstract: Materials exhibiting electronic inhomogeneities at the nanometer scale have enormous potential for applications. Magnetic polarons are one such type of inhomogeneity which link the electronic, magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom in correlated matter and often give rise to colossal magnetoresistance. Here, we investigate single crystals of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ by thermal expansion and magnetostriction along different crystallographic directions. These data provide compelling evidence for the formation of magnetic polarons in Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ well above the magnetic ordering temperature. More specifically, our results are consistent with anisotropic polarons with varying extent along the different crystallographic directions. A crossover revealed within the magnetically ordered phase can be associated with a surprising stabilization of ferromagnetic polarons within the global antiferromagnetic order upon decreasing temperature. These findings make Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ a rare example of such coexisting and competing magnetic orders and, importantly, shed new light on colossal magnetoresistive behavior beyond manganites.

Abstract: Motivated by a recent pseudo-spin model for monolayer-bilayer phase transitions in silver-based honeycomb layered materials, we propose that the critical pseudo-magnetic fields in such systems correspond to both the infinite-channel Feshbach resonance widths of a (Fermi-Dirac/Bose-Einstein/etc.) condensate in 2 dimensions, and equivalently to the Lee-Yang zeros of the Ising model of two pseudo-spins with a partition function corresponding to a class of functions that must include the Riemann Xi function. Identifying the quantum-mechanical operator that yields the discontinuous/random/topological spectrum of the critical pseudo-magnetic fields in such systems offers a tenable realisation of the Hilbert-P\'{o}lya conjecture.

Abstract: Superlattice formation dictates the physical properties of many materials, including the nature of the ground state in magnetic materials. Chemical composition is commonly considered to be the primary determinant of superlattice identity, especially in intercalation compounds. Here, we find that, contrary to this conventional wisdom, kinetic control of superlattice growth leads to the coexistence of disparate domains within a compositionally "perfect" single crystal. We demonstrate that Cr$_{1/4}$TaS$_2$ is a bulk noncollinear antiferromagnet in which scattering between bulk and minority superlattice domains engenders complex magnetotransport below the N\'{e}el temperature, including an anomalous Hall effect. We characterize the magnetic phases in different domains, image their nanoscale morphology, and propose a mechanism for nucleation and growth. These results provide a blueprint for the deliberate engineering of macroscopic transport responses via microscopic patterning of magnetic exchange interactions in superlattice domains.

arXiv:2411.09912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moskowitz-Lombardi rule gives a simple relation between the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus and the effect of its radial distribution on the hyperfine structure - the magnetic hyperfine anomaly or "Bohr-Weisskopf" effect. It was originally formulated for mercury, for which experimental data for nuclear magnetic moments and hyperfine constants were available for a number of isotopes. While the relation for the differential effect between isotopes may be completely determined experimentally, the value for the additive constant that is needed to give the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect for a single isotope has remained untested. In this work, we determine the BW effect in singly-ionized and neutral mercury from experimental muonic Hg-199 data together with our atomic calculations. We check this result by directly extracting the BW effect from the hyperfine constant for singly-ionized Hg-199 using state-of-the-art atomic many-body calculations. From this we deduce an empirical value for the additive constant in the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule, which differs significantly from the values advocated previously.

Abstract: Important advances have recently been made in the search for materials with complex multi-phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light-matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above-bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes has been experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion has been limited to perturbative levels. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to overcome this challenge by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid-infrared pulses, we induce ferroelectric reversal in lithium niobate and phase switching in tin selenide and characterize the large-amplitude mode displacements through femtosecond Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and x-ray diffraction. This approach, validated by first-principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast speeds.

# Satellite monitoring of long period ocean-induced magnetic field variations

## 长周期海洋感应磁场变化的卫星监测

arXiv:2411.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite magnetic field observations have the potential to provide valuable information on dynamics, heat content and salinity throughout the ocean. Here we present the expected spatio-temporal characteristics of the ocean-induced magnetic field at satellite altitude on periods of months to decades. We compare these to the characteristics of other sources of Earth's magnetic field, and discuss whether it is feasible for the ocean-induced magnetic field to be retrieved and routinely monitored from space.
  We focus on large length scales (spherical harmonic degrees up to 30) and periods from one month up to five years. To characterize the expected ocean signal we make use of advanced numerical simulations taking high resolution oceanographic inputs and solve the magnetic induction equation in 3D including galvanic coupling and self induction effects. We find the time-varying ocean-induced signal dominates over the primary source of the internal field, the core dynamo, at high spherical harmonic degree with the cross-over taking place at degree 15 to 20 depending on the considered period. The ionospheric and magnetospheric fields (including their Earth induced counterparts) have most power on periods shorter than one month and are expected to be mostly zonal in magnetic coordinates at satellite altitude.
  Based on these findings we discuss future prospects for isolating and monitoring long period ocean induced magnetic field variations using data collected by present and upcoming magnetic survey satellites.

# Radio-frequency induced Autler-Townes Effect for single- and double-photon magnetic-dipole transitions in the Cesium ground state

## 铯基态中单光子和双光子磁偶极跃迁的射频感应autler-townes效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10327

arXiv:2411.10327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have observed the Autler-Townes effect in single- and suspected double-photon magnetic-dipole transitions in the Cesium ground-state magnetic-sublevel manifold. Experiments were performed in a Cesium vapor cell. The D$_1$ line was excited by laser radiation to create ground-state optical polarization, and transitions between the ground-state magnetic sublevels were excited by radio-frequency (RF) radiation. Two different excitation geometries were studied: in one case the electric field vector of the linearly polarized laser radiation was parallel to the static magnetic field, whereas in the other case these vectors were perpendicular. The oscillating magnetic field produced by the RF coils was in the plane perpendicular to the electric field vector of the laser radiation. The Autler-Townes effect was confirmed by its linear dependence on the RF magnetic field amplitude, which is proportional to the Rabi frequency, in the case of single-photon transitions. We also observed peaks that by their position appeared to correspond to double and even triple photon transitions, which were more pronounced when the DC magnetic field and optical electric field vectors were perpendicular. In the peak at an energy that corresponds to two photons, splitting with a quadratic dependence on the RF magnetic field amplitude could be observed. The experimental measurements are supplemented by theoretical calculations of a model $J=1 \longrightarrow J=0$ system.

Abstract: Global attention has been focused on extreme climatic changes. This paper investigates the relationship between different phases of solar activity and extreme precipitation events in Kerala, India. Sunspot number and rainfall data were analysed over 122 years (1901-2022) on an annual scale. A negative correlation was observed in the winter and post-monsoon seasons, while positive correlations were seen in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, all of which were statistically significant. Using cross-wavelet transform, the temporal relationship between sunspot number and rainfall values was investigated, revealing significant cross-power at an 8-12 year scale across all seasons. Wavelet coherence between the two data sets demonstrated significant correlation at the 2-4 and 4-8 year scales throughout the four seasons. The results show that the seasonal rainfall over Kerala is related to solar activity. The solar phases of Solar Cycles 14-24 were determined for all seasons, and the years with excessive and insufficient rainfall were identified. It was observed that the descending phase had an impact on excess rainfall events during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons, while the ascending phase notably affected the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The study specifically examined the different magnetic polarities of sunspots in alternating solar cycles, focusing on even and odd cycles. It was found that extreme rainfall events were more frequent during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons in the even cycles, whereas in the odd cycles, they were more prevalent during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. These findings are presented for the first time and may offer new perspectives on how different phases affect rainfall. This study suggests a physical link between solar activity and extreme precipitation in Kerala, which could increase predictability.

# A reconfigurable non-linear active metasurface for coherent wave down-conversion

arXiv:2411.09965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces can manipulate the amplitude and phase of electromagnetic waves, offering applications ranging from antenna design and cloaking to imaging and communication. Additionally, temporal, and non-linear metasurfaces have the potential to adjust the frequency of impinging waves, driving advancements in frequency conversion, sensing, and quantum systems. Here, we report the demonstration of a non-linear active electronic-photonic metasurface that transfers information from an impinging optical wave to a millimeter-wave (mm-wave) beam. The proof-of-concept metasurface is designed to radiate a steerable 28GHz beam when illuminated with an optical wave at 193THz and consists of optically synchronized electronic-photonic chips tiled on a printed circuit board containing a microstrip patch antenna array. Input light, modulated with a data-encoded mm-wave carrier, is coupled into electronic-photonic chips using microlenses. Within each chip, the mm-wave signal is detected, phase-adjusted, amplified, and routed to an off-chip antenna. Beam-steering over a range of 60$^{\circ}$ in elevation and azimuth and data transmission at 2Gb/s over a fiber-wireless link is demonstrated. Free-space optical synchronization can significantly reduce the complexity of large-scale metasurfaces composed of non-uniform or randomly placed elements, is compatible with scalable architectures, and facilitates data transfer and mm-wave beam shaping, allowing for large-scale high-bandwidth and energy-efficient links with reduced complexity for the next generation communication, computation, sensing and quantum systems.

# Simulation of Thermal Nonequilibrium Cycles in the Solar Wind

## 太阳风中热非平衡循环的模拟

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10215

arXiv:2411.10215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) is a condition of the plasma in the solar corona in which the local rate of energy loss due to radiation increases to the point that it cannot be sustained by the various heating terms acting on the plasma, precluding the existence of a steady state. The limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation that result from TNE have been simulated in 1D models of coronal loops, as well as 2D and 3D models of the solar chromosphere and lower corona. However, a careful study of TNE in the solar wind has not been performed until now. Here we demonstrate that for suitable combinations of local and global heating rates it is possible for the plasma to exhibit a TNE condition, even in the context of a transonic solar wind with appreciable mass and energy fluxes. This implies limits on the amount of foot-point heating that can be withstood under steady-state conditions in the solar wind, and may help to explain the variability of solar wind streams that emanate from regions of highly concentrated magnetic flux on the solar surface. The implications of this finding pertain to various sources of high-density solar wind, including plumes that form above regions of mixed magnetic polarity in polar coronal holes and the slow solar wind (SSW) that emanates from coronal hole boundaries.

Abstract: Based on our previous study [S. Wang $\textit{et al}$. J. Chem. Phys. $\textbf{153}$, 184102 (2020)], we generalize the theory of molecular emission power spectra (EPS) from one molecule to multichromophoric systems in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. This generalized theory is applicable to ensembles of molecules, providing a comprehensive description of the molecular spontaneous emission spectrum in arbitrary inhomogeneous, dispersive, and absorbing media. In the far-field region, the analytical formula of EPS can be expressed as the product of a lineshape function (LF) and an electromagnetic environment factor (EEF). To demonstrate the polaritonic effect on multichromophoric systems, we simulate the LF and EEF for one to three molecules weakly coupled to surface plasmon polaritons above a silver surface. Our analytical expressions show that the peak broadening originates from not only the spontaneous emission rates but also the imaginary part of resonant dipole-dipole interactions (non-Hermitian interactions), which is associated with the superradiance of molecular aggregates, indicating that the superradiance rate can be controlled through an intermolecular distance and the design of dielectric environments. This study presents an alternative approach to directly analyze the hybrid-state dynamics of multichromophoric systems coupled with polaritons.

Abstract: In this study, we examine thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall effect in electron-ion plasmas relevant to hot neutron stars, white dwarfs, and binary neutron star mergers, focusing on densities found in the outer crusts of neutron stars and the interiors of white dwarfs. We consider plasma consisting of single species of ions, which could be either iron $\isotope[56]{Fe}$ or carbon $\isotope[12]{C}$ nuclei. The temperature range explored is from the melting temperature of the solid $T\sim10^9$~K up to $10^{11}$~K. This covers both degenerate and non-degenerate electron regimes. We find that thermal conductivity increases with density and temperature for which we provide analytical scaling relations valid in different regimes. The impact of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity is also analyzed, showing anisotropy in low-density regions and the presence of the thermal Hall effect characterized by the Righi--Leduc coefficient. The transition from a degenerate to non-degenerate regime is characterized by a minimum ratio of thermal conductivity to temperature, which is analogous to the minimum observed already in the case of electrical conductivity. We provide also formulas fit to our numerical results, which can be used in dissipative magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of warm compact stars.

arXiv:2410.23048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-mode fibers are used in fiber-optic gyroscopes to measure the Sagnac effect and are planned to be used in forthcoming experiments on the gravitationally induced phase shift in single photons. However, current theoretical models of such experiments are limited to ray-optics approximations or, if based on wave optics, to a restricted class of fiber alignments. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper develops a comprehensive perturbative scheme to solve for electromagnetic modes, i.e., monochromatic solutions to Maxwell's equations, of arbitrarily bent step-index fibers in general stationary space-times. This leads to transport equations for the electromagnetic phase and polarization that include the gravitational redshift, the Sagnac effect, a generalization of Rytov's law to curved space, a gravitational Faraday effect in the form of shift-induced gyrotropy, as well as inverse spin Hall effects caused by fiber bending, gravitational acceleration, and space-time curvature.

Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-swb7z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Sulfur-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and coordination polymers (CPs) are an emerging class of hybrid materials that have received growing attention due to their potential magnetic, conductive, and catalytic properties with applications in electrocatalysis and energy storage. In this work, we report a high-throughput virtual screening protocol to predict the synthesizability of candidate metal-sulfur MOFs/CPs by computing the thermodynamically stable structures resulting from a particular combination of metal cluster, linker, cation, and synthetic conditions. Free energies are computed using all-atom classical mechanical thermodynamic integration. Low-free energy structures are refined using ab initio density functional theory, and pair distribution functions and powder X-ray diffraction patterns calculated to complement and guide experimental structure determination. We validate the computational approach by retrospective predictions of the stable structure produced by experimental syntheses, and a subsequent screen predicts Fe4S4-BDT--TPP as a new thermodynamically stable 1D CP comprising a redox-active Fe4S4 cluster, 1,4-benzenedithiolate (BDT) linker, and tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP) countercation. This material is experimentally synthesized and the 1D chain structure of the crystal confirmed using microcrystal electron diffraction. The computational screening pipeline is generically transferable to neutral and ionic MOFs/CPs comprising arbitrary metal clusters, linkers, cations, and synthetic conditions, and we make it freely available as an open source tool to guide and accelerate the discovery and engineering of novel porous materials.

# Functionalized Cyclic Olefin Copolymers: Chemoselective Polymerization of Cyclopropane-Containing Norbornadiene Dimer using Titanium Catalyst and Post-Polymerization Modification

The synthesis of functionalized polyolefins is important for turning their properties and expanding their application range. However, the copolymerization of olefins with polar monomers using early transition-metal catalysts remains a formidable challenge. Here, we demonstrate a synthesis strategy through the Ti-catalyzed addition polymerization of a cyclopropane-containing norbornadiene dimer (1) followed by post-polymerization modification (PPM). The polymerization of 1 using a constrained-geometry Ti catalyst afforded poly1 with narrow molecular weight distributions (Đ < 1.3), wherein the molecular weight linearly increased against the monomer conversion. Additionally, the copolymerization of 1 with 1-octene proceeded rapidly, and 1 was consumed faster than 1-octene to form gradient copolymers. The 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies indicated the 2,3-addition structure of poly1 and no side reaction at the cyclopropane moiety. The polymerizations were highly controlled and chemoselective owing to the lack of cyclopropane coordination to the active polymerization Ti species. The PPM of poly(1-co-1-octene) via the protic acid-catalyzed ring-opening reaction of the cyclopropane introduced aromatic, acyloxyl, and alkoxy groups in high incorporation ratios without cross-linking reactions. Thus, this work demonstrates a promising procedure for the modification of cyclic olefin copolymers using specific cyclopropane reactivity.

# Metabolic changes in living human lymphoma cells intervening NAD+ metabolism as revealed by NAD(P)H-fluorescence lifetime imaging and para-hydrogen induced polarization NMR.

Proliferating cells have a sustained high demand for regeneration of electron acceptors as NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H is involved in a number of critical redox-reactions within cells. However, their analysis in living cells is still challenging.
We propose that combining label-free NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging (NAD(P)H-FLIM) and signal-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy allows new, deeper insights into changes of specific metabolic pathways in living cells.
For proof of principle NAD+-metabolism was perturbed by specific inhibiton of the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD+ „Salvage pathway“ Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) by FK866 in RAMOS human lymphoma cells. FK866 treatment leads to NAD(H) reduction followed by reduced RAMOS cell proliferation. The NAD(P)H-FLIM analysis revealed increased general NAD(P)H-dependent metabolic activity indicated by increased ratios of enzyme-bound to total NAD(P)H concentration upon NAMPT-inhibition. More importantly, a marked reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity accompanied by NADPH oxidase activity increase is observed. Using signal-enhanced MR spectroscopy a reduced flux of pyruvate to lactate catalyzed by LDH is detectable in real time in living cells. This strongly supports NAD(P)-FLIM analysis and demonstrates that intervening into the NAD+ „Salvage pathway“ can have specific and global consequences for cells. 
Our principle study shows how spatially-resolved metabolic imaging techniques, i.e. NAD(P)H-FLIM, are complemented by real-time MR, paving the way towards a comprehensive spatio-temporal understanding of metabolic pathways in living cells.

Choerospondias axillaris, recognized as an effective herbal remedy for coronary heart disease(CHD), has been clinically utilized. Although the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been extensively investigated as a pertinent target for CHD treatment, there is currently limited research on screening potential ACE inhibitors from Choerospondias axillaris. To advance the broader utilization of Choerospondias axillaris in coronary heart disease treatment, the target active components of ACE in Choerospondias axillaris were analyzed through the integration of magnetic targeted fishing technique with magnetic nano-microspheres. Magnetic nanospheres functionalized with GO@Fe3O4@SiO2-ACE(SMGO-ACE) were characterized using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), scanning electron microscope(SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The specific binding of lisinopril with an angiotensin-converting enzyme was employed to optimize the performance of the synthesized material and the relevant conditions during targeted fishing. Subsequently, five active ingredients were identified as (-) - (7R, 8S) - dihydrodehydrophenol, Isovanillin, Quinic acid, Chrysin, and Isorhamnetin, This study provides a precedent for the targeted salvage and separation of active ingredients in complex mixtures.

Background The Gas6/TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) receptor system has been implicated in demyelination and delayed remyelination in experimental animal models, but data in humans are scarce. We aimed to investigate the role of Gas6/TAM in neurodegenerative processes in multiple sclerosis (MS).Methods From a prospective 5-year follow-up study, soluble Gas6/TAM biomarkers were analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;40), progressive MS (PMS) (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;20), and healthy controls (HC) (n&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;25). Brain volumes, including myelin content (MyC) and white matter (WM) were measured by synthetic magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, 12 months, and 60-month follow-up. Associations with brain volume changes were investigated in multivariable linear regression models. Gas6/TAM concentrations were also determined at 12 month follow-up in RRMS to assess treatment response.Results Baseline concentrations of Tyro3, Axl, and Gas6 were significantly higher in PMS vs. RRMS and HC. Mer was significantly higher in PMS vs. HC. Tyro3 and Gas6 were associated with reduced WM (&beta;&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;25.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] [6.11&amp;ndash;44.96, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.012; &beta;&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;11.4, 95%CI [0.42&amp;ndash;22.4], p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.042, respectively) and MyC (&beta;&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;7.95, 95%CI [1.84&amp;ndash;14.07], p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.012; &beta;&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;4.4, 95%CI [1.04&amp;ndash;7.75], p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.012 respectively) at 60 months. Patients with evidence of remyelination at last follow-up had significantly lower baseline soluble Tyro3 (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.033) and Gas6 (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.014). Except Mer, Gas6/TAM concentrations did not change with treatment in RRMS.Discussion Our data indicate a potential role for the Gas6/TAM receptor system in neurodegenerative processes influencing demyelination and ineffective remyelination.

Fe-Al and Fe-Al-Sn alloys were prepared using the high-energy ball milling process. The effects of adding small amounts of tin on structural and microstructural properties were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), 57Fe M&ouml;ssbauer Spectroscopy, and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The M&ouml;ssbauer spectra of all samples reveal the presence of both magnetic and paramagnetic components. For Fe-Al alloys, the spectrum obtained after 1 hour of milling contains a magnetically split sextet with a hyperfine field (Hₕf) of 33.1 T and an isomer shift (IS) of 0.00 mm/s, characteristic of the starting bcc Fe powder. The spectrum recorded after 32 hours of milling indicates more advanced alloying. At this stage, a significant decrease in the intensity of the bcc Fe sextet in favor of the paramagnetic quadrupole doublet's intensity was observed. The doublet seen in the center of the M&ouml;ssbauer spectrum was attributed to the paramagnetic Fe(Al) solid solution. The relative fraction of this paramagnetic component increased to approximately 63.11%, with an isomer shift (IS) of 0.21 mm/s. For the Fe-Al-Sn alloy, the relative fraction of the paramagnetic component was found to be 33.33%.

# Emergent photons and fractionalized excitations in a quantum spin liquid

## 量子自旋液体中的出射光子和分馏激发

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3691304/latest

A quantum spin liquid (QSL) arises from a highly entangled superposition of many degenerate classical ground states in a frustrated magnet, and is characterized by emergent gauge fields and deconfined fractionalized excitations (e.g., spinons)1-5. Because such a novel phase of matter is relevant to high-transition-temperature superconductivity6,7 and quantum computation8,9, the microscopic understanding of QSL states is a long-sought goal in condensed matter physics. The 3D pyrochlore lattice of corner-sharing tetrahedra can host a QSL with U(1) gauge fields called quantum spin ice (QSI)10, which is a quantum (with effective S=1/2) analog of the classical (with large effective moment) spin ice11-13. A key difference between QSI and classical spin ice is the predicted presence of the linearly dispersing collective excitations near zero energy, dubbed the &ldquo;photons&rdquo;, arising from emergent quantum electrodynamics, in addition to the spinons at higher energies10,14,15. Recently, 3D pyrochlore systems Ce2M2O7 (M = Sn, Zr, Hf) have been suggested as effective S=1/2 QSI candidates16-23, but there has been no evidence of quasielastic magnetic scattering signals from photons, a key signature for a QSI. Here, we use polarized neutron scattering experiments and low-temperature specific heat measurements on single crystals of Ce2Zr2O7 to conclusively demonstrate the presence of magnetic excitations near zero energy at 33-50 mK in addition to signatures of spinons at higher energies, and T 3 temperature dependence of the heat capacity expected for linearly dispersing gapless bosonic modes14,15,24. &amp;nbsp;Using an acoustic phonon mode to normalize spin excitations in absolute units25, we calculate the normalized quantum Fisher information (nQFI) as a witness of multipartite entanglement26,27 and find nQFI=3.7&plusmn;0.7 at the (0,0,1) position, implying that the system must be at least four-partite entangled. &amp;nbsp;By comparing the energy (E), wave vector (Q), and polarization dependence of the magnetic excitations with theoretical calculations28-34, we conclude that Ce2Zr2O7 is the first example of a dipolar-octupolar &pi;-flux QSI32 with dominant dipolar Ising interactions.

# Leakage Inductance Analysis of Small-Size AFPMSMs with Different Core Materials for Micro Generator Application

## 微型发电机用不同铁芯材料的小型AFPMSMs漏感分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5151395/latest

This study investigates the leakage inductance of small-size axial flux permanent-magnet synchronous machines (AFPMSM) with different core materials under saturation conditions. Two identical AFPMSMs were manufactured, one with a soft magnetic composite (SMC) stator core and the other with a grain-oriented (GO) steel stator core. First, the synchronous inductance values for both motors are calculated analytically, considering the magnetizing, slot leakage, tooth-tip leakage, end-winding leakage, and air-gap harmonic leakage components according to saturation values of magnetic flux density. This finding is further supported by finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. Phase inductance measurements for both AFPMSMs were obtained using analytical, simulation, and experimental methods. The phase inductance was measured as 288.9 uH for the GO steel core AFPMSM and 204.86 uH for the SMC core AFPMSM using an LCR meter. The phase inductance ratio was found to be 0.709. The average inductance ratio was 0.743 during operation in the range of 2000&amp;ndash;10000 rpm and 1&amp;ndash;10 mNm.
