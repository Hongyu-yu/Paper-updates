# Exotic Quantum Phenomena in Twisted Bilayer Graphene

## 扭曲双层石墨烯中的奇异量子现象

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00854

arXiv:2411.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene twisted at the angle of about 1.1{\deg} better known as magic angle, exhibits ultra-flat moir\'e superlattice bands that are a source of highly-tunable, exotic quantum phenomena. Such phenomena, like superconductivity, correlated Mott-like insulating states and orbital ferromagnetism are driven by strong-correlation physics that defies classical theories. The inadequacy of such classical models and the lack of theoretical understanding of the recently observed exotic phenomena calls for revisiting the theory behind the material system and associating it with the observed behaviour. This article reviews the physics behind twisted bilayer graphene, focusing primarily on moir\'e physics and the importance of electronic (flat) band structure. In addition, this paper provides a brief overview of the emerging phenomena of correlated insulating states, superconductivity and orbital ferromagnetism. Finally, the most recent developments in controlling the interaction-driven states and tuning the electronic interactions are presented.

# Large dynamical magnetic effective charges in the Jahn-Teller KCoF$_3$

## Jahn-teller kcoof $_3 $ 中的大动态磁有效电荷

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00974

arXiv:2411.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute from density functional theory calculations the dynamical magnetic effective charges of the Jahn-Teller ground state of KCoF$_3$ and we unexpectedly obtain the largest up-to-date values reported in real materials (close to 200$\times 10^{-2}\mu_{\text{B}}/\text{\r{A}}$). We determine that those large values are due to both spin and orbital contributions, as expected from the presence of unquenched Co-d orbital magnetic moment, even though we show that the Co dynamical magnetic effective charges values are surprisingly zero by symmetry. Hence, we conclude that even if KCoF$_3$ is not multiferroic, it is antimagnetoelectric with a compensating but large individual magnetic sublattice magnetoelectric response of 210 ps/m per spin-channel. Our study shows that the dynamical magnetic effective charges might be an important property of magnetic materials beyond the magnetoelectric ones.

# Optical Band Engineering of Monolayer WSe2 in a Scanning Tunneling Microscope

## 扫描隧道显微镜中单层WSe2的光带工程

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01010

arXiv:2411.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense electromagnetic fields can result in dramatic changes in the electronic properties of solids. These changes are commonly studied using optical probes of the modified electronic structure. Here we use optical-scanning tunneling microscopy (optical-STM) equipped with near-field continuous wave (CW) laser excitation to directly measure the electronic structure of light-dressed states in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor, WSe2. We find that the effective tunneling gap and tunneling density of states are strongly influenced by the intensity of the electromagnetic field when the applied field is resonant with the bandgap of the semiconductor. Our findings indicate that CW laser excitation can be used to generate light-dressed electronic states of quantum materials when confined strongly to the nanoscale.

# Half-Metallicity in Triangulene-based Superatomic Graphene

arXiv:2411.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets has opened up new possibilities for miniaturizing spintronic devices to the monolayer limit. 2D half-metals, capable of conducting fully spin-polarized currents when spin-orbit coupling is minimal, provide a key advantage in improving device performance. Extensive theoretical research has been carried out to discover 2D half-metals, yet their realization remains elusive. Here we report the bottom-up synthesis of superatomic graphene and the demonstration of its half-metallic properties. The produced graphene half-metal is fabricated through an on-surface synthetic approach with phosphorus-doped triangulene as its building block. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements reveal its metallic band structures and identify its ferromagnetism through magnon excitation under varying magnetic fields. Density functional theory simulations accurately capture its half-metallic characteristics, uncovering the origin of spin-polarized bands from the p$_x,_y$-like orbital of superatomic graphene. Our work demonstrates intrinsic 2D carbon magnetism, paving the way for harnessing its advantages in spintronics.

arXiv:2411.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and magnetic effects of non-magnetic vanadium (V) doping in helimagnetic SrFeO$_{3-\delta}$ (SFO) are investigated, focusing on up to 3% substitution at the Fe site. Structural analysis from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy, supported by phonon mode calculations, reveals that pure SFO exists as a mixed tetragonal-orthorhombic phase, while V-doped samples exhibit an emerging cubic phase alongside tetragonal symmetry. Magnetic hysteresis (M-H) loops show notable ferromagnetic behavior within the antiferromagnetic matrix, persisting even at room temperature. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements indicate a Neel temperature (TN ) shift from 70K to 55K, along with increased magnetization differences in field-cooled (FC) and zero field-cooled (ZFC) data, reflecting heightened magnetic frustration due to competing FM/AFM exchange interactions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses reveal a rise in Fe$^{3+}$ and V$^{5+}$ states, affecting oxygen vacancy distributions and corresponding structural shifts seen in XRD and Raman results. The multivalent Fe$^{3+}$/Fe$^{4+}$ and V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ states enhance double-exchange (DE) and super-exchange (SE) interactions (Fe$^{3+}$-O-Fe$^{4+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$-O-V$^{5+}$), promoting ferromagnetism. Frequency-dependent magnetization studies display a subtle susceptibility peak shift, indicating spin-glass-like behavior in V-doped samples.

# Longitudinal and transverse mobilities of $n$-type monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the presence of proximity-induced interactions at low temperature

## 在低温下存在邻近诱导的相互作用的情况下，$ n型单层过渡金属二硫化物的纵向和横向迁移率

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01160

arXiv:2411.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical investigation on the electronic transport properties of $n$-type monolayer (ML) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at low temperature in the presence of proximity-induced interactions such as Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and the exchange interaction. The electronic band structure is calculated by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian, and the electric screening induced by electron-electron interaction is evaluated under a standard random phase approximation approach. In particular, the longitudinal and transverse or Hall mobilities are calculated by using a momentum-balance equation derived from a semi-classical Boltzmann equation, where the electron-impurity interaction is considered as the principal scattering center at low temperature. The obtained results show that the RSOC can induce the in-plane spin components for spin-split subbands in different valleys, while the exchange interaction can lift the energy degeneracy for electrons in different valleys. The opposite signs of Berry curvatures in the two valleys would introduce opposite directions of Lorentz force on valley electrons. As a result, the transverse currents from nondegenerate valleys can no longer be canceled out so that the transverse current or Hall mobility can be observed. Interestingly, we find that at a fixed effective Zeeman field, the lowest spin-split conduction subband in ML-TMDs can be tuned from one in the $K'$-valley to one in the $K$-valley by varying the Rashba parameter. The occupation of electrons in different valleys also varies with changing carrier density. Therefore, we can change the magnitude and direction of the Hall current by varying the Rashba parameter, effective Zeeman field, and carrier density by, e.g., the presence of a ferromagnetic substrate and/or applying a gate voltage.

# Magneto-optical conductivity of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the presence of proximity-induced exchange interaction and external electrical field

## 在邻近诱导的交换相互作用和外部电场存在下单层过渡金属二硫属化物的磁光电导率

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01162

arXiv:2411.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magneto-optical (MO) properties of monolayer (ML) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the presence of external electrical and quantizing magnetic fields and of the proximity-induced exchange interaction. The corresponding Landau Level (LL) structure is studied by solving the Schr\"odinger equation and the spin polarization in ML-TMDs under the action of the magnetic field is evaluated.The impact of trigonal warping on LLs and MO absorption is examined. Furthermore, the longitudinal MO conductivity is calculated through the dynamical dielectric function under the standard random-phase approximation (RPA) with the Kubo formula. We take ML-MoS$_2$ as an example to examine the effects of proximity-induced exchange interaction, external electrical and magnetic fields on the MO conductivity induced via intra- and interband electronic transitions among the LLs. For intraband electronic transitions within the conduction or valence bands, we can observe two absorption peaks in terahertz (THz) frequency range. While the interband electronic transitions between conduction and valence LLs show a series of absorption peaks in the visible range. We find that the proximity-induced exchange interaction, the carrier density, the strengths of the external electrical and magnetic fields can effectively modulate the positions of the absorption peaks and the shapes of the MO absorption spectra. The results obtained from this study can benefit to an in-depth understanding of the MO properties of ML-TMDs which can be potentially applied for magneto-optic, spintronic and valleytronic devices working in visible to THz frequency bandwidths.

Abstract: Unlike noncentrosymmetric superconductors, the effects of spin singlet- and spin triplet-pairing mixing in centrosymmetric superconductors remain ambiguous. Recently, it was experimentally demonstrated that an anisotropically enhanced in-plane critical fields beyond Pauli limit would be induced by the coupling of spin,orbit and parity ($p$-, $d$-orbitals) degrees of freedom in centrosymmetric transition metal dichacogenides , which is called as spin-orbit-parity coupled (SOPC) superconductors. In this work, we show that the SOPC would induce a strong spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing mixing near the topological band inversion in this system. Moreover, we find that the presence of such mixing provides a close explanation of the observed the in-plane upper critical fields $B_{c2}$ in terms of both the enhancement and anisotropy. We also propose measuring the equal-spin Andreev reflection between 2M-WS$_2$ and a ferromagnetic (FM) lead to detect the spin-triplet pairing in 2M-WS$_2$. Our work paves a way to study the spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing in centrosymmetric superconductors with strong spin-orbital parity coupling.

Abstract: Multiply connected electronic networks threaded by flux tubes have been proposed as a platform for adiabatic quantum transport and topological states. Multi-terminal Josephson junction (MTJJ) has been suggested as a pathway to realize this concept. Yet, the manifestations of topology in MTJJ remain open for experimental study. Here, we investigated the artificial topological band structure of three-terminal graphene Josephson junctions. Employing tunnelling spectroscopy and magnetic flux gates, we captured the tomography of the Andreev bound state (ABS) energy spectrum as a function of two independent phase differences. This ABS spectrum exhibits the topological transition from gapped to gapless states, akin to the band structure of nodal-line semimetals. Our results show the potential of graphene-based MTJJs for engineering band topologies in higher dimensions.

Abstract: The relation between superconductivity and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is one of the most fascinating problems in condensed matter physics. Although most superconductors inherently possess TRS, nonmagnetic disorder can induce states that demonstrate the breaking of this symmetry. Yet, the identification of experimental signatures of superconductivity with broken TRS remains a challenge. Here, we fabricate vertical Josephson junctions using metallic superconductor (Al) and ion bombarded Sr2RuO4 to study disorder-driven TRS breaking effects. We observe persistent magnetoresistive hysteresis behavior dependent on the disorder deposition time that provides evidence of TRS breaking below the superconducting transition temperature. Field and temperature dependent measurements suggest that the observed effects arise from disorder-induced anomalous flux in Sr2RuO4 which can be sensitively detected by superconducting Al. Our experimental results can be accounted within a physical framework of disorder-induced reconstruction of the superconducting order parameter as described within a multiband Ginzburg-Landau approach.

Abstract: The newly identified field-induced up-up-down order in Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$ etc. renewed attention on exotic phases in spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnets. Here, we report a unique zero-field noncoplanar up,up,down, down,down,up Kagome spin order in spin-1/2 antiferromagnet Clinoatacamite, Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$, which consists of weakly-coupled Kagome layers and was known as the parent compound for the most researched spin liquid candidate Herbertsmithite ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. The two-dimensional uud-ddu Kagome order develops below T$_{N1}$ = 18.1 K in Clinoatacamite before a further transition into a three-dimensional magnetic order at low temperatures below T$_{N2}$ ~ 6.4 K with persistent spin fluctuations. The present work reveals a new unpredicted Kagome order in a readily accessible temperature range in the parent compound of a well-studied spin liquid. In addition, it has also solved a puzzling issue for a mysterious magnetic phase.

arXiv:2411.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two models have recently been proposed for a description of dielectric spectroscopy measurements of ferroelectric nematics (NF) in thin planar capacitors. The polarization-external capacitance Goldstone reorientation mode (PCG model) considers the NF layer between the electrodes as an effective low resistivity material, the resistivity being inversely proportional to the square of polarisation magnitude. The high-{\epsilon} model considers the NF material as having a huge permittivity due to the ease of polarisation rotation. In this paper we study implications of both models and show, why both models describe majority of the observed dielectric spectroscopy results equally well. We point out differences among the models predictions and explain why some observations can be explained only by the high-{\epsilon} model. The major difference between the models is that the high-{\epsilon} model predicts that the increase in the cell thickness can lead to an increase in the frequency range within which capacitors filled with NF material can be used for energy storage while within the PCG model this frequency range reduces with increasing capacitor thickness. Within both models a crucial parameter which determines the behaviour of the capacitors filled with a NF material is parasitic resistance, primarily due to the electrode resistance. We present measurements of electrode resistance and find that in ITO cells it is of the order of few hundred ohms.

arXiv:2411.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A p-n junction, induced in graphene by gating, works to contrast the edge states of electrons and holes on each side of it. In a magnetic field those edge states carry two species of persistent current, which are intimately tied to the edge-mode spectra. We study how those persistent currents change along each side of the junction as the Fermi level is varied, with special emphasis on the electron-hole conjugation property of the Dirac electrons. A close look is made into the electromagnetic response of the valence band filled with negative-energy electrons, or the Dirac sea, which as a whole turns out to be electrically inactive while showing intrinsic orbital diamagnetism. Recently, in experiment, it became possible to observe local currents in planar samples by use of a nanoscale magnetometer. The p-n junctions in graphene and related atomic layers, via detection of associated microscopic currents, will be a useful platform for exploring many-body quantum phenomena.

arXiv:2411.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $1/r$ long-range interaction introduced by the laser beams offers a mechanism for the implementation of stable self-trapping in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the three-dimensional free space. Using the variational approximation and numerical solution, we find that self-trapped states in this setting closely resemble tightly-bound compactons. This feature of the self-trapped states is explained by an analytical solution for their asymptotic tails. Further, we demonstrate that stable vortex quasi-compactons (QCs), with topological charges up to $6$ (at least), exist in the same setting. Addressing two-body dynamics, we find that pairs of ground states, as well as vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex pairs, form stably rotating bound states. Head-on collisions between vortex QCs under small kicks are inelastic, resulting in their merger into a ground state soliton that may either remain at the collision position or move aside, or alternatively, lead to the formation of a vortex that also moves aside.

Abstract: The impact of vacancies on spin-resolved electronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) in phosphorene-based junctions, are investigated numerically. Regardless of the crystal orientation, a phosphorene nanoribbon (PNR) containing a monovacancy is found to exhibit a topological quasi-flat band that emerges within the band gap. The electronic properties of QDs, including spatial confinement and energy level distribution, can be strongly tuned by controlling the topological structure of the QDs and by applying electric fields. Additionally, these QDs exhibit remarkable spin-selective properties under a ferromagnetic exchange field, enabling the manipulation of QD features. This opens up the potential for novel applications such as quantum computing, magnetic sensing, spin-based light emission.

arXiv:2411.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic Gilbert damping and spin-orbital to charge interconversion phenomenon play vital role in controlling the modern spintronics device performances. Though the ferromagnets (FMs) and heavy metals (HMs) are considered to be the key components of the future spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) devices, recently the integration of lighter materials with low intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in spintronics devices has proven to be noteworthy. Here we demonstrate the efficient control of magnetization dynamics of $\beta$-W/CoFeB bilayer when capped by low SOC organic and inorganic layers. The C$_{60}$ capping layer (CL) significantly enhances the magnetization relaxation process compared to the CuO$_x$ in $\beta$-W/CoFeB/CL heterostructures, while the static magnetic properties remain in-different irrespective of the nature of CL. Interestingly, the spin-orbital to charge conversion phenomenon is found to be enhanced for $\beta$-W/CoFeB/CuO$_x$ stacking compared to the $\beta$-W/CoFeB/C$_{60}$ heterostructure, signifying the anti-correlation between the magnetic damping and spin-orbital to charge conversion. The results are interpreted by the interfacial phenomena, like the orbital Rashba effect, two-magnon scattering, and interfacial spin memory loss. Our detailed experimental investigations shed light on the importance of low SOC materials in effectively tuning the magnetization dynamics for the development of future power efficient spintronics devices.

# Cancellation theorem breaking and resonant spin-tensor Hall conductivity in higher-rank spin-tensor Hall effects

arXiv:2411.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent advances in simulating quantum phenomena in cold atoms, the higher-rank spin tensor Hall effect was discovered in larger spin systems with spin-tensor-momentum coupling, which is an extension of the celebrated spin Hall effects in larger spins. Previously, it has been proposed that a 2D electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling can generate dissipationless transverse spin current, namely the spin Hall effect. However, later work showed that the spin current is canceled by vertex correction, which was subsequently proven by a cancellation theorem that does not depend on any assumptions related to the scattering mechanism, the strength of spin-orbit coupling, or the Fermi energy. While the recent proposal demonstrates a universal intrinsic spin-tensor Hall conductivity, it is unclear if it vanishes similarly to the spin Hall effect. In this work, we address this critical problem and show that the rank-2 spin-tensor current can be divergent by considering the contributions of both interbranch and intrabranch transitions, which resembles the quantum Hall effect in some sense. So the \textit{universal} spin-tensor Hall effect can not be observed in a system with finite size. However, we further show that there is an \textit{observable non-zero} resonance of spin-tensor Hall conductivity as the Landau levels cross under the magnetic field. Our work reveals interesting conductivity properties of larger-spin systems and will provide valuable guidance for experimental explorations of higher-rank spin-tensor Hall effects, as well as their potential device applications.

arXiv:2411.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals recently discovered in van der Waals structures of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. These chiral phonons can emerge under the inversion symmetry breaking introduced by an effective mass imbalance between the two layers or a moir\'e potential in one layer, as well as under the time-reversal symmetry breaking realized by applying a magnetic field. Considering the wide tunability of layered materials, the frequencies and chirality values of phonons can both be tuned by varying the system parameters. These findings suggest that bilayer honeycomb-type Wigner crystals can serve as an exciting new platform for studying chiral phonons.

Abstract: Spin Berry curvature characterizes the band topology as the spin counterpart of Berry curvature and is crucial in generating novel spintronics functionalities. By breaking the crystalline inversion symmetry, the spin Berry curvature is expected to be significantly enhanced; this enhancement will increase the intrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials and, thus, the spin-orbit torques (SOTs). However, this intriguing approach has not been applied to devices; generally, the extrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayer is used for SOT magnetization switching. Here, SOT-induced partial magnetization switching is demonstrated in a single layer of a single-crystalline Weyl oxide SrRuO3 (SRO) with a small current density of ~3.1{\times}10^6 A cm-2. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure in the seemingly perfect periodic lattice of the SRO film reveals barely discernible oxygen octahedral rotations with angles of ~5{\deg} near the interface with a substrate. Tight-binding calculations indicate that a large spin Hall conductivity is induced around small gaps generated at band crossings by the synergy of inherent spin-orbit coupling and band inversion due to the rotations, causing magnetization reversal. Our results indicate that a minute atomic displacement in single-crystal films can induce strong intrinsic SOTs that are useful for spin-orbitronics devices.

Abstract: The interplay between short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) universal behaviors remains a fundamental topic in studying long-range interacting systems. The interaction between LR coupling and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism introduces significant complexity, especially in the two-dimensional (2D) XY model, which is crucial for exploring low-dimensional phenomena and their implications for quantum computation. In the paper [arXiv:2404.08498], we investigated the 2D XY model with algebraically decaying interactions of the form $1/r^{2+\sigma}$. Our findings demonstrated continuous phase transitions into a ferromagnetic phase for $\sigma \leq 2$, characterized by the emergence of long-range order. In the ferromagnetic phase, for $\sigma<2$, we identified a power-law decaying correlation function attributed to the Goldstone mode, and for $\sigma=2$, logarithmic behaviors were observed. In this supplemental paper, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the detailed methodology, additional simulation results, and further insights into the above phenomena. It enhances our understanding of the crossover between SR and LR behaviors and has practical implications for experimental systems, such as Rydberg atom arrays.

# Site Selective Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Partial Order in Kondo Lattices

arXiv:2411.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the combination of a new effective Hamiltonian approach and hybrid Monte-Carlo simulations, we unveil a variety of partially magnetically ordered (PMO) phases in the Kondo lattice model. Our approximation is motivated by two crucial features of the Hamiltonian: (i) formation of Kondo singlets leading to vanishing local magnetic moments, and (ii) spatially correlated nature of the effective single-particle kinetic energy. We discover PMO phases with fractional values $1/4$, $3/8$, and $1/2$ of Kondo-screened sites. A common understanding of these states emerges in terms of a non-local ordering mechanism. The concept of site-selective spontaneous symmetry breaking introduced here provides a new general approach to study models of interacting fermions in the intermediate coupling regime.

Abstract: Applying strain to epitaxial thin films has proven to be an effective approach for controlling material properties, paving the way for "materials by design". In this study, we explore this concept in the context of topological Kagome antiferromagnets, which can exhibit a range of exotic magnetic states. One such material, Mn$_{3}$Sn, features a non-collinear yet coplanar inverse triangular spin order that lacks scalar spin chirality. By applying anisotropic strain to reduce the point group symmetry of the Kagome triangles from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{1}$, and utilizing the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in epitaxial Mn$_{3}$Sn heterostructures, we achieve a canting of the manganese spins out of the Kagome plane. This newly induced magnetic state introduces a finite scalar spin chirality and results in a significant Berry phase in momentum space. Consequently, a large anomalous Hall effect emerges in the Kagome plane at room temperature, which can be fully controlled by charge current, enabling the realization of multiple-stable antiferromagnetic memory states.

arXiv:2411.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev model, renowned for its exact solvability and potential to host non-Abelian anyons, remains a focal point in the study of quantum spin liquids and topological phases. While much of the existing literature has employed Majorana fermion techniques to analyze the model, particularly at zero temperature, its finite-temperature behavior has been less thoroughly explored via alternative approaches. In this paper, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of the Kitaev model using the spin Green's function formalism. This approach enables the computation of key physical quantities such as spin correlations, magnetic susceptibility, and the dynamical spin structure factor, offering crucial insights into the system's thermal dynamics. In solving the equation of motion for the spin Green's function, we truncate the hierarchy of multi-spin Green's functions using a decoupling approximation, which proves to be particularly accurate at high temperatures. Our results show several similarities with Majorana-based numerical simulations, though notable differences emerge. Specifically, both static and dynamical spin-spin correlation functions capture not only $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations but also simple spin-flip excitations, with the latter overshadowing the former. Interestingly, without explicitly assuming fractionalization, our results for the spin susceptibility and spin relaxation rate still suggest the presence of fermionic degrees of freedom at low temperatures. This study provides a complementary approach to understanding the thermal properties of the Kitaev model, which could be relevant for future experiments and theoretical investigations.

# Spin-stripe order tied to the pseudogap phase in La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4

arXiv:2411.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although spin and charge stripes in high-Tc cuprates have been extensively studied, the exact range of carrier concentration over which they form a static order remains uncertain, complicating efforts to understand their significance. In La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) and in zero external magnetic field, static spin stripes are confined to a doping range well below p*, the pseudogap boundary at zero temperature. However, when high fields suppress the competing effect of superconductivity, spin stripe order is found to extend up to p*. Here, we investigated La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4 (Eu-LSCO) using 139La nuclear magnetic resonance and observe field-dependent spin fluctuations suggesting a similar competition between superconductivity and spin order as in LSCO. Nevertheless, we find that static spin stripes are present practically up to p* irrespective of field strength: the stronger stripe order in Eu-LSCO prevents superconductivity from enforcing a non-magnetic ground state, except very close to p*. Thus, spin-stripe order is consistently bounded by p* in both LSCO and Eu-LSCO, despite their differing balances between stripe order and superconductivity. This indicates that the canonical stripe order, where spins and charges are intertwined in a static pattern, is fundamentally tied to the pseudogap phase. Any stripe order beyond the pseudogap endpoint must then be of a different nature: either spin and charge orders remain intertwined, but both fluctuating, or only spin order fluctuates while charge order remains static. The presence of spin-stripe order up to p*, the pervasive, slow, and field-dependent spin-stripe fluctuations, as well as the electronic inhomogeneity documented in this work, must all be carefully considered in discussions of Fermi surface transformations, quantum criticality, and strange metal behavior.

arXiv:2411.01930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that epitaxial thin film antiferromagnet Mn2As exhibits the quench-switching effect, which was previously reported only in crystallographically similar antiferromagnetic CuMnAs thin films. Quench switching in Mn2As shows stronger increase in resistivity, reaching hundreds of percent at 5K, and significantly longer retention time of the metastable high-resistive state before relaxation towards the low-resistive uniform magnetic state. Qualitatively, Mn2As and CuMnAs show analogous parametric dependence of the magnitude and relaxation of the quench-switching signal. Quantitatively, relaxation dynamics in both materials show direct proportionality to the N\'eel temperature. This confirms that the quench switching has magnetic origin in both materials. The presented results suggest that the antiferromagnets crystalizing in the Cu2Sb structure are well suited for exploring and exploiting the intriguing physics of highly non-uniform magnetic states associated with the quench switching.

Abstract: Recently discovered high-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La-327) is believed to be driven by the non-phononic repulsive interaction. Depending on the strength of the interlayer repulsion, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is expected to be either $d$-wave or sign-changing bonding-antibonding $s_{\pm}$-wave. Unfortunately, due to the need of high pressure to reach superconducting phase, conventional spectroscopic probes to validate the symmetry of the order parameter are hard to use. Here, we study the effect of the point-like non-magnetic impurities on the superconducting state of La-327 and show that $s_{\pm}$-wave and $d$-wave symmetries show a very different behavior as a function of impurity concentration, which can be studied experimentally by irradiating the La-327 samples by electrons prior applying the pressure. While $d-$wave superconducting state will be conventionally suppressed, the $s_{\pm}$-wave state shows more subtle behavior, depending on the asymmetry between bonding and antibonding subspaces. For the electronic structure, predicted to realize in La-327, the $s_{\pm}-$wave state will be robust against complete suppression and the transition temperature, $T_c$ demonstrates a transition from convex to concave behavior, indicating a crossover from $s_{\pm}$-wave to $s_{++}$-wave symmetry as a function of impurity concentration. We further analyze the sensitivity of the obtained results with respect to the potential electronic structure modification.

Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides of group VI are well-known for their prominent excitonic effects and the transition from an indirect to a direct band gap when reduced to monolayers. While considerable efforts have elucidated the Rydberg series of excitons in monolayers, understanding their properties in multilayers remains incomplete. In these structures, despite an indirect band gap, momentum-direct excitons largely shape the optical response. In this work, we combine magneto-reflectance experiments with theoretical modeling based on the $\mathbf {k\cdot p}$ approach to investigate the origin of excitonic resonances in WSe$_2$ bi-, tri-, and quadlayers. For all investigated thicknesses, we observe a series of excitonic resonances in the reflectance spectra, initiated by a ground state with an amplitude comparable to the ground state of the 1$s$ exciton in the monolayer. Higher energy states exhibit a decrease in intensity with increasing energy, as expected for the excited states of the Rydberg series, although a significant increase in the diamagnetic shift is missing in tri- and quadlayers. By comparing the experimental observations with theoretical predictions, we discover that the excitonic resonances observed in trilayers originate from two Rydberg series, while quadlayers exhibit four such series, and bilayers host a single Rydberg series similar to that found in monolayers.

arXiv:2411.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the instability of antiferromagnets with easy-axis anisotropy under a magnetic field, uncovering single or even multiple phase transitions at the boundary between non-collinear and collinear spin orderings. Near the phase boundary, the entanglement between the sublattice magnons diverges due to the interplay among antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, anisotropy, and magnetic field. Furthermore, our study reveals that this magnetic criticality extends to a superradiant phase transition within cavity magnonics systems. The magnon-photon interaction results in diverging cavity photon numbers and squeezing in the ground state at the transition points between spin orderings. This investigation not only elucidates the criticality of multi-component squeezed magnons in antiferromagnets, but also proposes cavity photon measurements as a viable method for detecting magnetic phase transitions.

Abstract: Increasing complications due to bacterial and viral infections require novel antimicrobial approaches. One emerging strategy is that based on catalysts able to selectively deliver reactive oxygen species (ROS) without leaching of other substances. In particular, metal oxide thin films activated by daylight can produce ROS by simply catalyzing oxygen and water molecules. This study examines plasma technology, combining deposition and oxidation processes, as well as plasma polymerization, to obtain functionalized AgOx-doped titanium oxide (TiOx) catalytic materials. The high-energy conditions in the reactive, ionized gas enable the intrinsic formation of a large number of reactive sites at defects and interfaces between the metal oxide nanostructures. Furthermore, plasma functionalization with nanoporous SiOx films (up to 100 nm thick) allows to precisely control the ROS delivery as well as unravel ROS formation mechanism at the metal oxide interface. Combining fluorescence spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, the controlled delivery of superoxide anion and singlet oxygen has been tuned based on the thickness of the nanoporous functional layer. ROS delivery by functionalized catalytic plasma coating has been related to excellent antimicrobial activity against E. coli bacteria as well as murine hepatitis virus, while avoiding cytotoxic and sensitization effects.

Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have proven invaluable in condensed matter physics, particularly for studying ground states and thermal equilibrium properties of quantum Hamiltonians without a sign problem. Over the past decade, significant progress has also been made on their rigorous convergence analysis.
  Heisenberg antiferromagnets (AFM) with bipartite interaction graphs are a popular target of computational QMC studies due to their physical importance, but despite the apparent empirical efficiency of these simulations it remains an open question whether efficient classical approximation of the ground energy is possible in general. In this work we introduce a ground state variant of the stochastic series expansion QMC method, and for the special class of AFM on interaction graphs with an $O(1)$-bipartite component (star-like), we prove rapid mixing of the associated QMC Markov chain (polynomial time in the number of qubits) by using Jerrum and Sinclair's method of canonical paths. This is the first Markov chain analysis of a practical class of QMC algorithms with the loop representation of Heisenberg models.
  Our findings contribute to the broader effort to resolve the computational complexity of Heisenberg AFM on general bipartite interaction graphs.

Abstract: Spin is a fundamental property of any many-electron system. The ability of density functional theory to accurately predict the physical properties of a system, while varying its spin, is crucial for describing magnetic materials and high-spin molecules, spin flip, magnetization and demagnetization processes. Within density functional theory, when using various exchange-correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the spin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which is directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and challenges the description of molecular dissociation. In this paper, we study the behavior of the energy, the frontier Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals, the KS potentials and the electron density, with respect to fractional spin, in different atomic systems. We analyze five standard exchange-correlation functionals and find three main scenarios of deviation from the expected exact results. We clearly recognize a jump in the frontier orbital energies upon spin variation in the exact exchange and in hybrid functionals, and the related plateau in the corresponding KS potential. Our results are instrumental for the assessment of the quality of existing approximations from a new perspective and for the development of advanced functionals with sensitivity to magnetic properties.

Abstract: We study the finite temperature and edge induced effects on the charge and current densities for a massive spinor field localized on a 2D conical space threaded by a magnetic flux. The field operator is constrained on a circular boundary, concentric with the cone apex, by the bag boundary condition and by the condition with the opposite sign in front of the term containing the normal to the edge. In two-dimensional spaces there exist two inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra and the analysis is presented for both the fields realizing those representations. The circular boundary divides the conical space into two parts, referred as interior (I-) and exterior (E-) regions. The radial current density vanishes. The edge induced contributions in the expectation values of the charge and azimuthal current densities are explicitly separated in the both regions for the general case of the chemical potential. They are periodic functions of the magnetic flux and odd functions under the simultaneous change of the signs of magnetic flux and chemical potential. In the E-region all the spinorial modes are regular and the total charge and current densities are continuous functions of the magnetic flux. In the I-region the corresponding expectation values are discontinuous at half-integer values of the ratio of the magnetic flux to the flux quantum. 2D fermionic models, symmetric under the parity and time-reversal transformations (in the absence of magnetic fields) combine two spinor fields realizing the inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra. The total charge and current densities in those models are discussed for different combinations of the boundary conditions for separate fields. Applications are discussed for electronic subsystem in graphitic cones described by the 2D Dirac model.

Abstract: We present an innovative robotic device designed to provide controlled motion for studying active matter. Motion is driven by an internal vibrator powered by a small rechargeable battery. The system integrates acoustic and magnetic sensors along with a programmable microcontroller. Unlike conventional vibrobots, the motor induces horizontal vibrations, resulting in cycloidal trajectories that have been characterized and optimized. Portions of these orbits can be utilized to create specific motion patterns. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how this versatile system can be exploited to develop active particles with varying dynamics, ranging from ballistic motion to run-and-tumble diffusive behavior.

Abstract: Ferroelectric field-effect transistors integrated on 2D semiconducting platforms are extremely relevant for low power electronics. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel phase-change ferroelectric field effect transistor (PCFE-FET) for steep switching applications. Our gate stack is engineered as a ferroelectric Lanthanum doped hafnium oxide (LHO) proximity coupled with Mott insulator Ti$_x$O$_{2x-1}$(N$_y$) and is integrated onto a 2D MoS$_2$ channel. The interplay of partial polarization switching in the ferroelectric LHO layer and reversible field-tunable metal-insulator transition (MIT) in Ti$_x$O$_{2x-1}$(N$_y$) layer concomitantly triggers polar to non-polar phase transition in the LHO layer between 200 and 220 K. This results in distinctive step-like features in the channel current during DC measurements, and random current fluctuations in high-speed measurements with slim anticlockwise hysteresis. Our devices show subthreshold slopes as steep as 25 mV/dec at 210 K, breaking the Boltzmann limit. Our gate stack is also potentially tunable for operation at temperatures of interest, presenting innovative gate stack engineering approaches for low-power computing solutions.

Abstract: Materials-realistic microscopic theoretical descriptions of copper-based superconductors are challenging due to their complex crystal structures combined with strong electron interactions. Here, we demonstrate how density functional theory can accurately describe key structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the normal state of the prototypical cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212). We emphasize the importance of accounting for energy-lowering structural distortions, which then allows us to: (a) accurately describe the insulating antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of the undoped parent compound (in contrast to the metallic state predicted by previous {\it ab initio} studies); (b) identify numerous low-energy competing spin and charge stripe orders in the hole-overdoped material nearly degenerate in energy with the AFM ordered state, indicating strong spin fluctuations; (c) predict the lowest-energy hole-doped crystal structure including its long-range structural distortions and oxygen dopant positions that match high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements; and (d) describe electronic bands near the Fermi energy with flat antinodal dispersions and Fermi surfaces that in agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and provide a clear explanation for the structural origins of the so-called ``shadow bands''. We also show how one must go beyond band theory and include fully dynamic spin fluctuations via a many-body approach when aiming to make quantitative predictions to measure the ARPES spectra in the overdoped material. Finally, regarding spatial inhomogeneity, we show that the local structure at the CuO$_2$ layer, rather than dopant electrostatic effects, modulates the local charge-transfer gaps, local correlation strengths, and by extension the local superconducting gaps.

Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations, and their connection to the higher temperature pseudogap metal. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the pseudogap `Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency.

Abstract: Electronic properties of molecular conductors exhibiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin order and charge order (CO) owing to electron correlation are studied using first-principles density functional theory calculations. We investigate two systems, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott insulator $\beta^\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$ with an AFM ground state, and several members of quasi-one-dimensional (TMTTF)$_2$$X$ showing CO. The stabilities of the AFM and CO states are compared between the use of a standard exchange-correlation functional based on the generalized gradient approximation and that of a range-separated hybrid functional; we find that the latter describes these states better. For $\beta^\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$, the AFM order is much stabilized with a wider band gap. For (TMTTF)$_2$$X$, only by using the hybrid functional, the AFM insulating state is realized and the CO states coexisting with AFM order are stable under structural optimization, whose stability among different \textit{X} shows the tendency consistent with experiments.

Abstract: Alloying stands out as a pivotal technological method employed across various compounds, be they metallic, magnetic, or semiconducting, serving to fine-tune their properties to meet specific requirements. Ternary semiconductors represent a prominent example of such alloys. They offer fine-tuning of electronic bands, the band gap in particular, thus granting the technology of semiconductor heterostructures devices, key elements in current electronics and optoelectronics. In the realm of magnetically ordered systems, akin to electronic bands in solids, spin waves exhibit characteristic dispersion relations, featuring sizeable magnon gaps in many antiferromagnets. The engineering of the magnon gap constitutes a relevant direction in current research on antiferromagnets, aiming to leverage their distinct properties for THz technologies, spintronics, or magnonics. In this study, we showcase the tunability of the magnon gap across the THz spectral range within an alloy comprising representative semiconducting van-der-Waals antiferromagnets FePS$_3$ and NiPS$_3$. These constituents share identical in-plane crystal structures, magnetic unit cells and the direction of the magnetic anisotropy, but differ in the amplitude and sign of the latter. Altogether these attributes result in the wide tunability of the magnon gap in the Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$PS$_3$ alloy in which the magnetic order is imposed by stronger, perpendicular anisotropy of iron.

Abstract: We introduce a spin-1 version of the random energy model with crystal field. Crystal field controls the density of 0 spins in the system. We solve the model in the micro-canonincal ensemble. The model has a spin-glass transition at a finite temperature for all strengths of the crystal field. By introducing the magnetic field we also obtain the de Almeida Thouless line for the model. The spin-glass transition persists in the presence of external field. We also find that the magnetisation shows non-monotonic behaviour for high positive crystal field strengths. The zero magnetic field specific heat and magnetic susceptibility also exhibit a cusp beyond a threshold value of the crystal field.

Abstract: Spin gapless semiconductors based Heusler alloys are the special class of materials due to their unique band structure, high spin polarization and high Curie temperature. These materials exhibit a distinct electronic structure: a nonzero band gap in one spin channel while the other spin channel remains gapless, making them highly suitable for tunable spintronics. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of structural, magnetic, thermoelectric, and transport properties of the quaternary Heusler alloy CoFeMnSn is conducted. X-ray diffraction and Neutron diffraction analyses confirm a well ordered structure with partial antisite disorder between Co, Fe and Mn, Sn atoms. Magnetic studies show that the material exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, with a Curie temperature of around 660 K. Notably, we observe an anomalous Hall effect linked to intrinsic mechanisms driven by Berry curvature, underscoring the intricate relationship between structural disorder and electronic behavior. Transport measurements also highlight the impact of antisite disorder on the systems, with resistivity decreasing as temperature increases. These insights position CoFeMnSn as a promising material for future spintronic devices and advanced technological applications.

# Quantum Supercritical Regime with the Universally Boosted Magnetocaloric Effect

arXiv:2410.22236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Across finite temperatures and fields, a quantum critical point (QCP) can extend to a quantum critical regime (QCR), characterized by prominent quantum fluctuations and universal scalings. The QCR is essential for comprehending many-body systems and correlated quantum materials, attracting intensive research interest over the past decades. In this study, we identify a distinct quantum supercritical regime (QSR) that also originates from the QCP but is driven by a symmetry-breaking field $h$, which couples to the order parameter. The QSR has crossover lines following $T \propto h^{\frac{z\nu}{\beta+\gamma}}$, where $\beta, \gamma, z, \nu$ are the critical exponents. Amongst other intriguing phenomena in QSR, the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) exhibits a universally diverging magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio as $\Gamma_h \equiv \frac{1}{T} (\frac{\partial T}{\partial h})_{S} \propto T^{-\frac{\beta+\gamma}{z\nu}}$. This constitutes a boost in the universal MCE, when compared to that of QCR, as even a small field $h$ can induce a dramatic temperature variation. Experimental realizations involving quantum Ising and Heisenberg magnets are discussed. These systems offer an ideal platform for investigating quantum supercriticality and also hold significant potential as advanced refrigerants.

arXiv:2410.22769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a mechanism to realize the superconducting diode effect (SDE): The current can generate a magnetic field, affecting the magnetic moment of magnetic impurity. When the connection region of the Josephson junction is coupled with the magnetic impurity, the supercurrents in positive and negative directions have different influences on the magnetic moment. This results in a phenomenon that the critical supercurrents in these opposite directions are unequal, which is called SDE. We model the Josephson connection region by a quantum dot. Then the critical supercurrents are investigated by the non-equilibrium Green's function method, and we carry out a detailed symmetry analysis on the supercurrent relations. The calculation results confirm that the SDE does exist in this system. Besides, the SDE is significant in a wide parameter space and can be effectively adjusted in various ways. Our design only demands a magnetic impurity and conventional superconductors. The unconventional finite-momentum Cooper pair and spin-orbit coupling are not required, and there is also no need for the existence of chirality or an external magnetic field. Our work provides a universal device structure for the development of superconducting electronics.

Abstract: We consider Maxwell theory on a non-spin manifold. Depending on the choice of statistics for line operators, there are three non-anomalous theories and one anomalous theory with different symmetry fractionalizations. We establish the gauging maps that connect the non-anomalous theories by coupling them to a discrete gauge theory. We also construct topological interfaces associated with $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality and gauging of electric and magnetic one-form symmetries. Finally, by stacking the topological interfaces, we compose various kinds of duality defects, which lead to non-invertible symmetries of non-spin Maxwell theories.

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) possess valley pseudospin, allowing photon spin to be coupled to electron spin and enabling initialization and readout of both classical and quantum information. Rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission, even with linearly polarized excitation. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement, resulting in unitary emission circular dichroism (i.e. single-handed circularly polarized emission). Our fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiral electromagnetic modes with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths, spectrally tuned to the exciton energy of MoSe2 monolayers. Using spatially- and spectrally-resolved mapping from temperatures of 100 K to 294 K, we demonstrate degrees of circular polarization (DOP) reaching a record high of 0.5 at room temperature. Reciprocal space mapping of the exciton emission reveals the chiral q-BIC localizes valley-selective emission in the vicinity of the photonic gamma-point. Photon-spin and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states provided by the metasurface, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of approximately 13, with lifetimes as short as 189 ps. Our work could facilitate the development of compact chiral classical and quantum light sources and the creation of molecular chiral polaritons for quantum enantioselective synthesis.

Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.

arXiv:2411.01219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing complications due to bacterial and viral infections require novel antimicrobial approaches. One emerging strategy is that based on catalysts able to selectively deliver reactive oxygen species (ROS) without leaching of other substances. In particular, metal oxide thin films activated by daylight can produce ROS by simply catalyzing oxygen and water molecules. This study examines plasma technology, combining deposition and oxidation processes, as well as plasma polymerization, to obtain functionalized AgOx-doped titanium oxide (TiOx) catalytic materials. The high-energy conditions in the reactive, ionized gas enable the intrinsic formation of a large number of reactive sites at defects and interfaces between the metal oxide nanostructures. Furthermore, plasma functionalization with nanoporous SiOx films (up to 100 nm thick) allows to precisely control the ROS delivery as well as unravel ROS formation mechanism at the metal oxide interface. Combining fluorescence spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, the controlled delivery of superoxide anion and singlet oxygen has been tuned based on the thickness of the nanoporous functional layer. ROS delivery by functionalized catalytic plasma coating has been related to excellent antimicrobial activity against E. coli bacteria as well as murine hepatitis virus, while avoiding cytotoxic and sensitization effects.

Abstract: In this short communication, we qualitatively analyze possible effects of the 10 October 2024 geomagnetic storm on accelerating the reentry of a Starlink satellite from low-Earth orbit (LEO). The storm took place near the maximum of solar cycle (SC) 25, which has shown to be more intense than SC24. Based on preliminary geomagnetic indices, the 10 October 2024, along with the 10 May 2024, were the most intense events since the well-known Halloween storms of October/November 2003. By looking at a preliminary version of the Dst index and two-line element (TLE) altitude data of the Starlink-1089 (SL1089) satellite, we observe a possible connection between storm main phase onset and a sharp decay of SL1089. The satellite was scheduled to reenter on 22 October, but it reentered on 12 October, 10 days before schedule. The sharp altitude decay of SL1089 revealed by TLE data coincides with the storm main phase onset. Therefore, we call for future research to establish the eventual causal relationship between storm occurrence and satellite orbital decay. As predicted by previous works, SC25 is already producing extreme geomagnetic storms with unprecedented satellite orbital drag effects and consequences for current megaconstellations in LEO.

Abstract: Ferroelectric field-effect transistors integrated on 2D semiconducting platforms are extremely relevant for low power electronics. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel phase-change ferroelectric field effect transistor (PCFE-FET) for steep switching applications. Our gate stack is engineered as a ferroelectric Lanthanum doped hafnium oxide (LHO) proximity coupled with Mott insulator Ti$_x$O$_{2x-1}$(N$_y$) and is integrated onto a 2D MoS$_2$ channel. The interplay of partial polarization switching in the ferroelectric LHO layer and reversible field-tunable metal-insulator transition (MIT) in Ti$_x$O$_{2x-1}$(N$_y$) layer concomitantly triggers polar to non-polar phase transition in the LHO layer between 200 and 220 K. This results in distinctive step-like features in the channel current during DC measurements, and random current fluctuations in high-speed measurements with slim anticlockwise hysteresis. Our devices show subthreshold slopes as steep as 25 mV/dec at 210 K, breaking the Boltzmann limit. Our gate stack is also potentially tunable for operation at temperatures of interest, presenting innovative gate stack engineering approaches for low-power computing solutions.

Abstract: A formulation for the parametric instability of electromagnetic (EM) waves in magnetized pair plasma is developed. The linear growth rate of induced Compton scattering is derived analytically for frequencies below the cyclotron frequency for the first time. We identify three modes of density fluctuation: ordinary, charged, and neutral modes. In the charged mode, the ponderomotive force separates charges (electrons and positrons) longitudinally, in contrast to the nonmagnetized case. We also recognize two effects that significantly reduce the scattering rate for waves polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field: (1) the gyroradius effect due to the magnetic suppression of particle orbits, and (2) Debye screening for wavelengths larger than the Debye length. Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs), we find that these effects facilitate the escape of X-mode waves from the magnetosphere and outflow of a magnetar and neutron star, enabling 100\% polarization as observed. Our formulation provides a foundation for consistently addressing the nonlinear interaction of EM waves with magnetized plasma in astrophysics and laser physics.

arXiv:2411.01165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are subject to changes in their direction of propagation, tilt, and other properties as they interact with the variable solar wind. We investigated the heliospheric propagation of 15 Earth-impacting CMEs observed during April 2010 to August 2018 in the field of view (FOV) of the Heliospheric Imager (HI) onboard the STEREO. About half of the 15 events followed self-similar expansion up to 40 $R_\odot$. The remaining events showed deflection either in latitude, longitude, or a tilt change. Only two events showed significant rotation in the HI1 FOV. We also use toroidal and cylindrical flux rope fitting on the in situ observations of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind parameters to estimate the tilt at L1 for these two events. Although the sample size is small, this study suggests that CME rotation is not very common in the heliosphere. We attributed the observed deflections and rotations of CMEs to a combination of factors, including their interaction with the ambient solar wind and the influence of the ambient magnetic field. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex dynamics involved in CME propagation and highlight the need for comprehensive modeling and observational studies to improve space weather prediction. In particular, HI observations help us to connect observations near the Sun and near Earth, improving our understanding of how CMEs move through the heliosphere.

Abstract: Spin Berry curvature characterizes the band topology as the spin counterpart of Berry curvature and is crucial in generating novel spintronics functionalities. By breaking the crystalline inversion symmetry, the spin Berry curvature is expected to be significantly enhanced; this enhancement will increase the intrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials and, thus, the spin-orbit torques (SOTs). However, this intriguing approach has not been applied to devices; generally, the extrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayer is used for SOT magnetization switching. Here, SOT-induced partial magnetization switching is demonstrated in a single layer of a single-crystalline Weyl oxide SrRuO3 (SRO) with a small current density of ~3.1{\times}10^6 A cm-2. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure in the seemingly perfect periodic lattice of the SRO film reveals barely discernible oxygen octahedral rotations with angles of ~5{\deg} near the interface with a substrate. Tight-binding calculations indicate that a large spin Hall conductivity is induced around small gaps generated at band crossings by the synergy of inherent spin-orbit coupling and band inversion due to the rotations, causing magnetization reversal. Our results indicate that a minute atomic displacement in single-crystal films can induce strong intrinsic SOTs that are useful for spin-orbitronics devices.

# Generation of fast magnetoacoustic waves in the corona by impulsive bursty reconnection

arXiv:2411.02180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in the solar corona are often known to be produced by solar flares and eruptive prominences. We here simulate the effect of the interaction of an external perturbation on a magnetic null in the solar corona which results in the formation of a current sheet (CS). Once the CS undergoes a sufficient extension in its length and squeezing of its width, it may go unstable to the formation of multiple impulsive plasmoids. Eventually, the plasmoids merge with one another to form larger plasmoids and/or are expelled from the sheet. The formation, motion and coalescence of plasmoids with each other and with magnetic Y-points at the outer periphery of the extended CS are found to generate wave-like perturbations. An analysis of the resultant quasi-periodic variations of pressure, density, velocity and magnetic field at certain locations in the model corona indicate that these waves are predominantly fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves. For typical coronal parameters, the resultant propagating waves carry an energy flux of $\mathrm{10^{5}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}}$ to a large distance of at least 60 Mm away from the current sheet. In general, we suggest that both waves and reconnection play a role in heating the solar atmosphere and driving the solar wind and may interact with one another in a manner that we refer to as a $"$Symbiosis of WAves and Reconnection (SWAR)$"$.

Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides of group VI are well-known for their prominent excitonic effects and the transition from an indirect to a direct band gap when reduced to monolayers. While considerable efforts have elucidated the Rydberg series of excitons in monolayers, understanding their properties in multilayers remains incomplete. In these structures, despite an indirect band gap, momentum-direct excitons largely shape the optical response. In this work, we combine magneto-reflectance experiments with theoretical modeling based on the $\mathbf {k\cdot p}$ approach to investigate the origin of excitonic resonances in WSe$_2$ bi-, tri-, and quadlayers. For all investigated thicknesses, we observe a series of excitonic resonances in the reflectance spectra, initiated by a ground state with an amplitude comparable to the ground state of the 1$s$ exciton in the monolayer. Higher energy states exhibit a decrease in intensity with increasing energy, as expected for the excited states of the Rydberg series, although a significant increase in the diamagnetic shift is missing in tri- and quadlayers. By comparing the experimental observations with theoretical predictions, we discover that the excitonic resonances observed in trilayers originate from two Rydberg series, while quadlayers exhibit four such series, and bilayers host a single Rydberg series similar to that found in monolayers.

Abstract: The standard magnetorotational instability (SMRI) is widely believed to be responsible for the observed accretion rates in astronomical disks. It is a linear instability triggered in the differentially rotating ionized disk flow by a magnetic field component parallel to the rotation axis. Most studies focus on axisymmetric SMRI in conventional base flows with a Keplerian profile for accretion disks or an ideal Couette profile for Taylor-Couette flows, since excitation of nonaxisymmetric SMRI in such flows requires a magnetic Reynolds number Rm more than an order of magnitude larger. Here, we report that in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow, nonaxisymmetric SMRI can be destabilized in a free-shear layer in the base flow at Rm $\gtrsim$ 1, the same threshold as for axisymmetric SMRI. Global linear analysis reveals that the free-shear layer reduces the required Rm, possibly by introducing an extremum in the vorticity of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations validate the results from linear analysis and confirm that a novel instability recently discovered experimentally (Nat. Commun. 13, 4679 (2022)) is the nonaxisymmetric SMRI. Our finding has astronomical implications since free-shear layers are ubiquitous in celestial systems.

Abstract: According to classical electrodynamics, a steady loop current does not radiate. Edward, Kenyon, and Lemon take the approximated electric field equation (the approximation of the magnetic one is trivial) for a moving point charge and show that the electric field of a steady loop current can be partitioned into a static field falling with the square of the distance and a loop integral of an exact differential (also called total differential, full differential, or perfect differential). Thus, no radiation is emitted. Inspired by their work, we do the same to the electric and magnetic fields without approximation.

# Anisotropy in a wire medium resulting from the rectangularity of a unit cell

Abstract: The study is focused on the dispersion properties of a wire medium formed by a rectangular lattice of parallel wires at the frequencies close to its plasma frequency. While the effective medium theory predicts isotropic behaviour of transverse magnetic (TM) waves in the structure, numerical simulations reveal noticeable anisotropic properties. This anisotropy is dependent on the lattice rectangularity and reaches over 6% and over 75% along and across the wires respectively for thick wires with the radii about 20 times smaller than the smallest period. This conclusion is confirmed by line-of-current approximation theory. The revealed anisotropy effect is observed when the wavelength at the plasma frequency is comparable to the period of the structure. The effect vanishes in the case of extremely thin wires. A dispersion relation for TM waves in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point was obtained in a closed form. This provides an analytical description of the anisotropy effect.

# Room-temperature valley-selective emission in Si-MoSe2 heterostructures enabled by high-quality-factor chiroptical cavities

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) possess valley pseudospin, allowing photon spin to be coupled to electron spin and enabling initialization and readout of both classical and quantum information. Rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission, even with linearly polarized excitation. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement, resulting in unitary emission circular dichroism (i.e. single-handed circularly polarized emission). Our fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiral electromagnetic modes with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths, spectrally tuned to the exciton energy of MoSe2 monolayers. Using spatially- and spectrally-resolved mapping from temperatures of 100 K to 294 K, we demonstrate degrees of circular polarization (DOP) reaching a record high of 0.5 at room temperature. Reciprocal space mapping of the exciton emission reveals the chiral q-BIC localizes valley-selective emission in the vicinity of the photonic gamma-point. Photon-spin and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states provided by the metasurface, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of approximately 13, with lifetimes as short as 189 ps. Our work could facilitate the development of compact chiral classical and quantum light sources and the creation of molecular chiral polaritons for quantum enantioselective synthesis.

# Proton Acceleration in Low-beta Magnetic Reconnection with Energetic Particle Feedback

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection regions in space and astrophysics are known as active particle acceleration sites. There is ample evidence showing that energetic particles can take a substantial amount of converted energy during magnetic reconnection. However, there has been a lack of studies understanding the backreaction of energetic particles at magnetohydrodynamical scales in magnetic reconnection. To address this, we have developed a new computational method to explore the feedback by non-thermal energetic particles. This approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating their pressure into Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the energetic particles is evaluated from their distribution evolved through Parker's transport equation, solved using stochastic differential equations (SDE), so we coin the name MHD-SDE. Applying this method to low-beta magnetic reconnection simulations, we find that reconnection is capable of accelerating a large fraction of energetic particles that contain a substantial amount of energy. When the feedback from these particles is included, their pressure suppresses the compression structures generated by magnetic reconnection, thereby mediating particle energization. Consequently, the feedback from energetic particles results in a steeper power-law energy spectrum. These findings suggest that feedback from non-thermal energetic particles plays a crucial role in magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration.

# A kiloparsec-scale ordered magnetic field in a galaxy at z=5.6

Abstract: Magnetic fields are widely observed in various astronomical contexts, yet much remains unknown about their significance across different systems and cosmic epochs. Our current knowledge of the evolution of magnetic fields is limited by scarce observations in the distant Universe, where galaxies have recently been found to be more evolved than most model predictions. To address this gap, we conducted rest-frame 131 um full-polarisation observations of dust emission in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy, SPT0346-52, at z=5.6, when the Universe was only 1 Gyr old. Dust grains can become aligned with local magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of linearly polarised thermal infrared radiation. Our observations have revealed a median polarisation level of $0.9\pm0.2$ percent with a variation of $\pm0.4$ percent across the 3 kpc extention, indicating the presence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields. The polarised dust emission is patchy, offset from the total dust emission and mostly overlaps with the [C II] emission at a velocity of about -150 km/s. The bimodal distribution of field orientations, their spatial distribution, and the connection with the cold gas kinematics further emphasise the complexity of the magnetic environment in this galaxy and the potential role of mergers in shaping its magnetic fields. Such early formation of ordered galactic magnetic fields also suggests that both small-scale and large-scale dynamos could be efficient in early galaxies. Continued observations of magnetic fields in early galaxies, as well as expanding surveys to a wider galaxy population, are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and impact of magnetic fields in the evolving Universe.

# Intramolecular Magnetic Exchange Interaction in Dichalcogenide Substituted Organic Diradical Dications

Organic diradical dications, due to reduced intermolecular interactions, exhibit a greater tendency to adopt high spin states in the solid phase compared to their neutral diradical counterparts. This characteristic makes them promising candidates for applications involving organic electronics. We present a theoretical study of a recently synthesized sulfur-based diradical dication, a unique system exhibiting a robust triplet ground state. Using a number of density functional theory (DFT) based methods (e.g. standard broken-symmetry DFT, constrained DFT, spin-flip TDDFT) and wavefunction-based multi-reference CASSCF+NEVPT2 methods, we investigate its magnetic properties and explore the influence of chalcogen substitution on the magnetic exchange coupling. An active space scanning method was adopted to overcome the difficulties in choosing the correct active space for multireference calculation. Our findings highlight the critical role of multi-reference methods in accurately capturing the magnetic behavior of highly pi-conjugated systems. The study reveals a surprising variation in magnetic properties among sulfur, selenium, and tellurium-based diradical dications, despite being elements of the same group. These results offer valuable insights into the design and tuning of magnetic properties in organic diradical dications.

# Spin Hall and Edelstein Effects in Novel Chiral Noncollinear Altermagnets

## 新型手性非共线高磁中的自旋霍尔和Edelstein效应

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5367202/latest

Altermagnets are a newly discovered class of magnetic phases that combine the spin polarization behavior of ferromagnetic band structures with the vanishing net magnetization characteristic of antiferromagnets. Initially proposed for collinear magnets, the concept has since been extended to include certain non-collinear structures. A recent development in Landau theory for collinear altermagnets incorporates spin-space symmetries, providing a robust framework for identifying this class of materials. Here we expand on that theory to identify altermagnetic multipolar order parameters in non-collinear chiral materials. We demonstrate that the interplay between non-collinear altermagnetism and chirality allows for spatially odd multipole components, leading to non-trivial spin textures on Fermi surfaces and unexpected transport phenomena, even in the absence of SOC. This makes such chiral altermagnets fundamentally different from the well-known SOC-driven Rashba-Edelstein and spin Hall effects used for 2D spintronics. Choosing the chiral topological magnetic material Mn3IrSi as a case study, we apply toy models and first-principles calculations to predict experimental signa- tures, such as large spin-Hall and Edelstein effects, that have not been previously observed in altermagnets. These findings pave the way for a new realm of spintronics applications based on spin-transport properties of chiral altermagnets.
