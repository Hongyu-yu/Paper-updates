# Nonresonant nonlinear magnonics in an antiferromagnet

arXiv:2411.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets exhibit rapid spin dynamics in a net zero magnetic background which enables novel spintronic applications and interrogation of many-body quantum phenomena. The layered antiferromagnet Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ hosts an exotic spin one-half Mott insulating state with an electronic gap arising from on-site Coulomb repulsion and strong spin-orbit coupling. This makes Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ an interesting candidate to interrogate dynamical attributes of the magnetic order using ultrafast laser pulses. We investigate the magnetization dynamics of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ following circularly-polarized photoexcitation with below-gap mid-infrared (mid-IR -- 9 $\mu m$) and above-gap near-infrared (near-IR -- 1.3 $\mu m$) pulses. In both cases, we observe excitation of a zone-center coherent magnon mode featuring a 0.5 THz oscillation in the pump-induced Kerr-rotation signal. However, only below-gap excitation exhibits a helicity dependent response and linear (quadratic) scaling of the coherent magnon amplitude with excitation fluence (electric field). Moreover, below-gap excitation has a magnon generation efficiency that is at least two orders of magnitude greater in comparison to above-gap excitation. Our analysis indicates that the helicity dependence and enhanced generation efficiency arises from a unique one-photon two-magnon coupling mechanism for magnon generation. Thus, preferential spin-photon coupling without photoexcitation of electrons permits extremely efficient magnon generation. Our results reveal new possibilities for ultrafast control of antiferromagnets.

# Inter-Event Time Power Laws in Heterogeneous Systems

## 异构系统中的事件间时间幂律

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10608

arXiv:2411.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic behavior of spin reversal events in the dilute Ising model, focusing on the influence of static disorder introduced by pinned spins. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that in a homogeneous, defect-free system, the inter-event time (IET) between local spin flips follows an exponential distribution, characteristic of Poissonian processes. However, in heterogeneous systems where defects are present, we observe a significant departure from this behavior. At high temperatures, the IET exhibits a power-law distribution resulting from the interplay of spins located in varying potential environments, where defect density influences reversal probabilities. At low temperatures, all site classes converge to a unique power-law distribution, regardless of their potential, leading to distinct critical exponents for the high- and low-temperature regimes. This transition from exponential to power-law behavior underscores the critical response features of magnetic systems with defects, suggesting analogies to glassy dynamics. Our findings highlight the complex mechanisms governing spin dynamics in disordered systems, with implications for understanding the universal aspects of relaxation in glassy materials.

# Stability frontiers in the AM$_6$X$_6$ kagome metals; The LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Lu,Y) family and density-wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$

arXiv:2411.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome motif is a versatile platform for condensed matter physics, hosting rich interactions between magnetic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom. In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves in FeGe and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM$_6$X$_6$ chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships between the $\approx$125 member family. Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ series of compounds into the broader AM$_6$X$_6$ family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research.

arXiv:2411.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered nature and simple structure of FeSe reveal this iron-based superconductor as a unique building block for the design of artificial heterostructure materials. While superconductivity develops in ultrathin films of FeSe on SrTiO3 substrates, it remains unclear whether it can be developed on more chemically inert, layered materials such as graphene. Here, we report on the characterization of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of few-layer FeSe on bilayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). STM imaging of our FeSe films with thicknesses up to three layers exhibit the tetragonal crystal structure of bulk FeSe, which is supported by XPS spectra consistent with the FeSe bulk counterpart. While our STS measurements at 340 mK reveal a metallic character for few-layer FeSe on BLG/SiC(0001), they show an absence of superconductivity, as the low-lying electronic structure exhibits a spatially anisotropic dip-like feature robust against magnetic fields. Superconductivity in FeSe/BLG/SiC(0001), however, emerges for thicker films with a transition temperature of 6 K. Our results underscore the significance of the substrate as key factor driving the suppression superconductivity in FeSe in the 2D limit.

arXiv:2411.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation using an f-d-p model, which is an effective model of UTe2. Solving the linearized Eliashberg equation in the f-d-p model based on third-order perturbation theory, we obtain a point-node-like s-wave pairing state. Our result shows that the Hebel-Slichter peak in the point-node-like s-wave pairing state is smaller than that in the isotropic s-wave pairing state. However, the Hebel-Slichter peak remains robust even in the point-node-like s-wave pairing state, and the point-node-like s-wave state is inconsistent with the results of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.

Abstract: The nanosized boron vacancy ($V_\mathrm{B}^-$) defect spot in hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) is promising for a local magnetic field quantum sensor. One of its advantages is that a helium-ion microscope can make a spot at any location in an $h$-BN flake with nanometer accuracy. In this study, we investigate the properties of the created nanosized $V_\mathrm{B}^-$ defect spots by systematically varying three conditions: the helium-ion dose, the thickness of the $h$-BN flakes, and the substrate on which the $h$-BN flakes are attached. The physical background of the results obtained is successfully interpreted using Monte Carlo calculations. From the findings obtained here, a guideline for their optimal creation conditions is obtained to maximize its performance as a quantum sensor concerning sensitivity and localization.

Abstract: We report the observation of a light-induced subpicosecond topological phase transition in the antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetal EuAgAs, achieved through precise manipulation of its magnetic configuration. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we probe the nonequilibrium carrier dynamics and reveal a magnetic-order-driven transition between distinct topological states. Our results demonstrate that EuAgAs, with its highly tunable magnetic structure, offers a unique platform for exploring topological phase transitions, distinct from conventional methods like Floquet engineering, coherent-phonon excitation, and lattice structural modifications. These results underscore the potential of ultrashort optical pulses as powerful tools for real-time control of topological phases, opening pathways for advances in spintronics, quantum computing, and energy-efficient information technologies.

arXiv:2411.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-body Fermi liquid effects in the SU($N$) Anderson impurity model in the strong interaction limit where the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of the impurity levels varies over the range of $0<1$. The three-body correlation of impurity electrons contributes to the next-to-leading order terms of transport coefficients at low energies when the electron-hole symmetry, the time-reversal symmetries, or both are broken by external fields or potentials. Using the numerical renormalization group approach, we calculate the differential conductance and the nonlinear current noise through quantum dots, as well as the thermal conductivity of both quantum dots and magnetic alloys. Specifically, we focus on the SU(2) and SU(4) cases and demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve in the limit of $U\to\infty$, across the $1/N$-filling Kondo regime and the valence fluctuation regime. Our results clarify how the three-body correlation affects low-energy transport, with a crucial dependence on the occupation number $N_d^{}$. We also show that the three-body correlation strongly couples with asymmetries in the tunnel couplings between quantum dots and reservoirs; in particular it significantly affects the nonlinear current through the quarter-filling Kondo state for $N=4$.

Abstract: This study presents the first-ever investigation of spin-phonon coupling mechanisms in fullerene-based single-molecule magnets (SMMs) using ab initio CASSCF combined with DFT calculations. While lanthanide-based SMMs, particularly those with DyIII ions, are known for their impressive blocking temperatures and relaxation barriers, endohedral metallofullerene (EMFs) offer a unique platform for housing low-coordinated lanthanides within rigid carbon cages. We have explored the spin dynamics of in DyScS@C82 exhibiting among the highest blocking temperature (TB) reported. Through our computational analysis, we reveal that while the fullerene cage enhances crystal field splitting and provides structural stability without significantly contributing to spin-relaxation-driving low-energy phonons, the internal ionic motion emerges as the primary factor controlling spin relaxation and limiting blocking temperature. This computational investigation into the spin dynamics of EMF-based SMMs provides key insights into their magnetic behaviour for the first time an

# Effect of Hubbard U corrections on the electronic and magnetic properties of 2D materials: A high-throughput study

## Hubbard U校正对2D材料的电子和磁性能的影响: 一项高通量研究

arXiv:2411.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic investigation of the role of Hubbard U corrections in electronic structure calculations of two-dimensional (2D) materials containing 3d transition metals. Specifically, we use density functional theory (DFT) with the PBE and PBE+U approximations to calculate the crystal structure, band gaps, and magnetic parameters of 638 monolayers. Based on a comprehensive comparison to experiments we first establish that inclusion of the U correction worsens the accuracy for the lattice constant. Consequently, PBE structures are used for subsequent property evaluations. The band gaps show significant dependence on the U-parameter. In particular, for 134 (21%) of the materials the U parameter leads to a metal-insulator transition. For the magnetic materials we calculate the magnetic moment, magnetic exchange coupling, and magnetic anisotropy parameters. In contrast to the band gaps, the size of the magnetic moments shows only weak dependence on U. Both the exchange energies and magnetic anisotropy parameters are systematically reduced by the U correction. On this basis we conclude that the Hubbard U correction will lead to lower predicted Curie temperatures in 2D materials. All the calculated properties are available in the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB).

arXiv:2411.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating magnetism at the THz timescale in atomically thin ferromagnets by exploiting the interactions of spins with optical phonon modes presents an innovative idea for THz spintronics. Spin-phonon coupling raises an important question about the flow of spin angular momentum possibly to chiral phonons. We use femtosecond optical pulses to generate bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) in the 2D ferromagnet CrI3, and probe the subsequent charge and spin dynamics. The observed change in the optical signal during temporal pump-probe overlap represents the buildup of the exciton population. This is accompanied by the excitation of coherent optical phonon modes with 2.4 and 3.9 THz frequencies, corresponding to the bending and stretching of the Cr-I bonds. We observe both modes in the magnetism channel which agrees with first-principles calculations that identify changes in the exchange coupling due to the lattice displacements for both phonon modes.

# Twisted Type-II Rashba Homobilayer: A Platform for Tunable Topological Flat Bands

arXiv:2411.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of topological flat bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and multilayer graphene has sparked significant research interest. We propose a new platform for realizing tunable topological moire flat bands: twisted type-II Rashba homobilayers. The interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions generates an effective pseudo-antiferromagnetic field, opening a gap within the Dirac cone with non-zero Berry curvature. Using twisted BiTeI bilayers as an example, we predict the emergence of flat topological bands with a remarkably narrow bandwidth (below 20 meV). Notably, the system undergoes a transition from a valley Hall insulator to a quantum spin Hall insulator as the twisting angle increases. This transition arises from a competition between the twisting-driven effective spin-orbit coupling and sublattice onsite energies presented in type-II Rashba moir\'e structures. The high tunability of Rashba materials in terms of the spin-orbit coupling strength, interlayer interaction, and twisting angle expands the range of materials suitable for realizing and manipulating correlated topological properties.

# Symmetry-based phenomenological model for magnon transport in a multiferroic

arXiv:2411.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons carriers of spin information can be controlled by electric fields in the multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ (BFO), a milestone that brings magnons closer to application in future devices. The origin of magnon-spin currents in BFO, however, is not fully understood due to BFO's complicated magnetic texture. In this letter, we present a phenomenological model to elucidate the existence of magnon spin currents in generalized multiferroics by examining the symmetries inherent to their magnetic and polar structures. This model is grounded in experimental data obtained from BFO and its derivatives, which informs the symmetry operations and resultant magnon behavior. By doing so, we address the issue of symmetry-allowed, switchable magnon spin transport in multiferroics, thereby establishing a critical framework for comprehending magnon transport within complex magnetic textures.

# Competing phases in kagome magnet FeGe from functional renormalization

arXiv:2411.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a charge density wave in FeGe extends the discussion of the nature of charge order in kagome metals to a magnetic compound. Motivated by this observation, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and functional-renormalization-group calculations to study interaction-induced Fermi-surface instabilities of the magnetic state of FeGe. We argue that the leading intra-band contribution to electronic correlations are approximately 2D and come from Van Hove points at the projected $M$~points. By varying parameters around DFT values, we determine a phase diagram for the quasi-2D scenario as function of on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions. We discuss universal aspects in the electronic mechanisms for the resulting phases, as well as the role of SU(2) symmetry breaking. We find FeGe to be in a regime of strong competition between $p$-wave charge density wave, $f$-wave pairing, and $d$-wave spin Pomeranchuk instabilities. This interplay can be influenced in favor of superconducting pairing for slightly increased nearest-neighbor interaction, suggesting a potential to induce superconductivity in FeGe.

Conventional techniques, including transient spin grating spectroscopy and spatial- and time-resolved Kerr rotation microscopy, are limited by fixed optical grating periods and uniform light polarization, respectively, which constrain the flexibility of spin helix generation. Here, we introduce a novel approach utilizing structured light to directly imprint spatial spin structures in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. This method allows for the precise control over the wave number and configuration of the spin helices, overcoming the limitations of previous techniques. Experiments conducted using pump-probe Kerr rotation microscopy combined with a programmable spatial light modulator revealed the efficient and tunable generation of spin helices. This approach is broadly applicable not only to semiconductors but also to magnetic thin films and 2D materials.

# Altermagnetic Perovskites

arXiv:2411.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet is a class of antiferromagnets, which shows a staggered spin ordering with wave vector ${\bm q}=0$, while its net magnetization is canceled out in the limit of zero relativistic spin-orbit coupling. The simplest case is when the up and down spins are ordered on two crystallographically equivalent sublattice sites within the unit cell that are not connected by translation, and consequently, the system breaks the macroscopic time-reversal symmetry. Accordingly, it exhibits non-relativistic spin splitting in the energy band and characteristic cross-correlation phenomena between spin, charge, and lattice (orbital) degrees of freedom. This is in contrast to conventional N\'{e}el-type antiferromagnets with ${\bm q} \neq 0$ conserving the macroscopic time-reversal symmetry, where the time-reversal operation flipping of spins combined with translation can make the system identical to the original state. Altermagneticsm is universally latent in various magnetic materials that have been considered as simple collinear-type antiferromagnets. In this article, we focus on perovskites with chemical formula {\it ABX}$_3$, which are typical playgrounds for strongly correlated electron systems, and overview their altermagnetic aspects that have been overlooked in the past researches, based on microscopic model studies revealing the mechanisms of their properties. We display that a combination of a variety of antiferromagnetic ordering and the commonly-seen lattice distortions in perovskites gives rise to a non-relativistic spin splitting whose mechanism does not rely on the spin-orbit coupling and its consequent spin current generation, and the anomalous Hall effect in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: Unconventional superconductors that spontaneously break space-group symmetries of their underlying crystal lattice are distinguished by spatial modulations of the superconducting order parameter. These states have recently captured significant attention in various strongly correlated materials, where the breaking of translational or intra-unit-cell symmetries results in the emergence of pair density waves with wavelengths extending across one or multiple unit cells. Here, we employ a spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscope to identify robust half-unit-cell modulations of the superconducting gap magnitude, coherence strength and subgap states in tunable 1T$^{\prime}$-MoTe$_2$ monolayer. The modulations are oriented perpendicular to the zigzag Mo chains and coexist with three-unit-cell primary pair density wave modulations along the Mo chains, both of which attenuate with increasing temperature and the application of external magnetic fields. Importantly, we find that the superconductivity modulations are strongly linked to unconventional electron pairing mechanisms, which significantly deviate from the Cooper pairing observed in traditional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. Our results advance the knowledge of Cooper-pair density modulations and the intricate interplay with other symmetry-breaking states in strongly correlated superconductors.

# Pseudotransitions in a dilute Ising chain

## 稀释的Ising链中的伪跃迁

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11104

arXiv:2411.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the ground state and thermodynamic properties of a spin-pseudospin chain representing a model of a one-dimensional dilute magnet with two types of nonmagnetic charged impurities. For this purpose, a method utilizing the transfer-matrix properties is employed. Despite the wide variety of intriguing frustrated phase states, we show that the model showcases pseudotransitions solely between simple charge and magnetic quasiorders. These pseudotransitions are characterized by distinct features in the thermodynamic and magnetic quantities, resembling first- and second-order phase transitions. In addition to pseudotransitions for the ``pure'' system, similar to those observed in other one-dimensional spin models, this study also reveals the presence of ``second-order'' pseudotransitions for the dilute case. We show that the nature of these discovered pseudotransitions is associated with the phase separation in the chain into regions of (anti)ferromagnetic and charge-ordered phases. The ability to compare the results of an exact transfer-matrix calculation with a simple phenomenological description within the framework of Maxwell construction contributes to a deeper understanding of both the physical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the analytical methods used.

arXiv:2411.11141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When interactions overcome disorder, integer quantum Hall plateaus support topological phases with different bulk insulators. In the center of the $\nu=1$ plateau the bulk is an Anderson-type insulator, while in the flanks of the plateau the bulk is the integer quantum Hall Wigner solid. We find that the activation energy along the $\nu=1$ plateau exhibits a very dramatic non-monotonic dependence on the magnetic field, a dependence that is strongly correlated with the stability regions of the two phases. Furthermore, the activation energy has an unexpected minimum at the boundary between the Anderson insulator and the Wigner solid. Our findings constrain the theory of the integer quantum Hall Wigner solid, determine its thermodynamic properties, and reveal novel behavior at the boundary between the Anderson insulator and the Wigner solid.

Abstract: Pressure evolution of RuO2 is studied using single-crystal x-ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell, combined with \textit{ab initio} band-structure calculations. The tetragonal rutile structure transforms into the orthorhombic CaCl$_2$-type structure above 13 GPa under quasi-hydrostatic pressure conditions. This second-order transition is ferroelastic in nature and accompanied by tilts of the RuO$_6$ octahedra. Orthorhombic RuO$_2$ is expected to be paramagnetic metal, similar to ambient-pressure RuO$_2$. It shows the increased $t_{2g}-e_g$ crystal-field splitting that is responsible for the pressure-induced color change. It further features the Dirac nodal line that shifts across the Fermi level upon compression.

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11154

arXiv:2411.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal telluride compositions are explored extensively for their unique magnetic behavior. Since chromium telluride (Cr2Te3) exhibits a near-room-temperature phase transition, the material can be effectively used in applications such as magnetic refrigeration. Compared to existing magnetocaloric materials, Heusler alloys, and rare-earth-based alloys, the large-scale synthesis of Cr2Te3 involves less complexity, resulting in a stable composition. Compared to existing tellurides, Cr2Te3 exhibited a large magnetic entropy change of 2.36 J/kg-K at a very small magnetic field of 0.1 T. The refrigeration capacity (RC) of 160 J/kg was determined from entropy change versus temperature curve. The results were comparable with the existing Cr compounds. The telluride system, Cr2Te3 compared to pure gadolinium, reveals an enhanced room temperature magnetocaloric effect (MCE) with a broad working temperature range. The heating cycle of MCE was successfully visualized using a thermal imaging setup. To confirm the observed magnetic properties of Cr2Te3, first-principles calculations were conducted. Through density functional theory (DFT) studies, we were able to determine both Curie temperature (TC) and Neel temperature (TN) which validated our experimental transitions at the same temperatures. Structural transition was also observed using first principles DFT calculation which is responsible for magnetic behavior.

# Theory of three-terminal Andreev spin qubits

## 三端Andreev自旋量子比特理论

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11155

arXiv:2411.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a concise theoretical framework for the equilibrium three-terminal Josephson effect in spin-orbit-interacting systems, inspired by recent experiments on an InAs/Al heterostructure [Phys. Rev. X 14, 031024 (2024)]. We develop an analytical model to capture the essential low-energy physics of the system and examine its potential as an Andreev spin qubit, while also reconciling some findings of Ref. [Phys. Rev. B 90, 155450 (2014)]. Our analysis of the transitions between the Andreev levels in the junction shows that, in an idealized scenario, the transition between the lowest pair of pseudo-spin-split Andreev levels is blocked by pseudo-spin conservation. We demonstrate that to operate the system as an Andreev spin qubit, leveraging the significant spin splitting observed experimentally, additional ingredients such as external magnetic filed or magnetic impurities are required. Finally, we apply our model to investigate the coupling between two such qubits, mediated by supercurrent.

Abstract: We performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments on single-crystal samples of the honeycomb lattice magnet, ilmenite NiTiO3. Below the Neel temperature of 22 K, spin wave excitations with a band energy of 3.7 meV were observed. The neutron energy spectra were well-reproduced by modeling the system as a ferromagnetic honeycomb lattice with antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, using linear spin wave theory. Similar to another ilmenite CoTiO3, a crossing structure was observed at the K point, suggesting the resence of Dirac magnons in NiTiO3. Further calculations suggested the formation of Dirac nodal line.

# Markov chains for the analysis of states of one-dimensional spin systems

## 用于分析一维自旋系统状态的马尔可夫链

arXiv:2411.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze frustrated states of the one-dimensional dilute Ising chain with charged interacting impurities of two types with mapping of the system to some Markov chain. We perform classification and reveal two types of Markov chains: periodic with period 2 and aperiodic. Frustrated phases with various types of chains have different properties. In phases with periodic Markov chains, long-range order is observed in the sublattice while another sublattice remains disordered. This results in a conjunction of the non-zero residual entropy and the infinite correlation length. In frustrated phases with aperiodic chains, there is no long-range order, and the correlation length remains finite. It is shown that under the magnetic field the most significant change in the spin chain structure corresponds to the change of the Markov chain type.

arXiv:2411.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange couplings are fundamental to our understanding of many physical phenomena in condensed matter physics and material science. Model systems provide a controlled environment to investigate such phenomena, effectively. In this study, we employ first-principle calculations based on density functional theory and Green's function (GF) method to explore the impact of chemical structure on the sign and magnitude of exchange coupling, systematically. By designing model systems with bcc-Fe bulk doped with nonmagnetic X= (H, B, C, N, O, and F) atoms, we examine the effects of different ligands on the behavior of Fe-Fe exchange coupling, and demonstrate that the chemical environment surrounding the metal atom significantly influences the Fe-Fe exchange coupling. Our results highlight the tunability of exchange coupling based on Fe-dopant bond length(s), where the nature of ligand atoms and their electron correlation play a crucial role. This work illuminates the complex relationship between structure, and magnetism in magnetic materials, providing insights into the development of high-performance magnetic materials.

Abstract: A source which generates sustained terahertz electromagnetic radiation (oscillator) controllable by an applied voltage is proposed. The structure consists of a nanocomposite slab containing metal nanorods enclosed between two graphene sheets which are electrostatically gated.

arXiv:2411.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear electrodynamics in materials manifests as an electronic response that depends on second- or higher-order powers of the applied electromagnetic field. This response is highly dependent on the underlying crystal symmetries in the material and is typically smaller than the linear responses. Nonlinear responses are therefore usually employed to expose the symmetry breaking, geometric properties of the electronic band structure in materials. Naturally, a material system with a strong nonlinear response is also the key component in nonlinear devices. Here we report the strong room-temperature second-harmonic transport response in a quantum magnet,TbMn6Sn6, which is governed by the quantum metric and can be tuned with applied magnetic fields and temperature. We show that around room temperature, which is close to the spontaneous spin-reorientation transition, the magnetic configurations, and therefore the related symmetry breaking phases, are easily controlled. Our results pave the way from quantum materials to high performance tuneable nonlinear device applications at room temperature.

arXiv:2411.11418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking is pivotal for controlling ferroelectric, ferroelastic and/or ferromagnetic functions of materials, which enables applications in sensors, memories, transducers or actuators. Commonly, ferroic phases emerge from descending symmetry-breaking, as the laws of thermodynamics dictate that the ordered low entropy phases form at low temperature, which limits practical applications of many materials at room temperature. Rare examples of ascending symmetry-breakings have been observed, but the driving force remains often unclear. Here, we report on a ferroelastic symmetry-breaking occurring at high temperature in a spin-crossover material, studied by magnetic, DSC and X-ray diffraction measurements. Our DFT calculations and our model, based on the Landau theory of phase transitions, explain how the cooperative thermal switching of molecular spin state drives a ferroelastic symmetry breaking at high temperature, through a coupled Jahn-Teller distortion. Ferroelastic materials have rich properties, with important applications in memory, multifunctional and novel controllable devices. The electronic bistability in soft functional materials represents an important source of entropy gain, capable of overcoming the cost of symmetry-breaking entropy, which opens up new perspectives for stabilizing high-temperature and low-symmetry ferroic functions of advanced materials

arXiv:2411.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder in the heterogeneous material stack of semiconductor spin qubit systems introduces noise that compromises quantum information processing, posing a challenge to coherently control large-scale quantum devices. Here, we exploit low-disorder epitaxial strained quantum wells in Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Ge wafers to comprehensively probe the noise properties of complex micron-scale devices comprising of up to ten quantum dots and four rf-charge sensors arranged in a two-dimensional array. We demonstrate an average charge noise of $\sqrt{S_{0}}=0.3(1)$ $\mu\mathrm{eV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz across different locations on the wafer, providing a benchmark for quantum confined holes. We then establish hole-spin qubit control in these heterostructures and extend our investigation from electrical to magnetic noise through spin echo measurements. Exploiting dynamical decoupling sequences, we quantify the power spectral density components arising from the hyperfine interaction with $^{73}$Ge spinful isotopes and identify coherence modulations associated with the interaction with the $^{29}$Si nuclear spin bath near the Ge quantum well. We estimate an integrated hyperfine noise amplitude $\sigma_f$ of 180(8) kHz from $^{73}$Ge and of 47(5) kHz from $^{29}$Si, underscoring the need for full isotopic purification of the qubit host environment.

arXiv:2411.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors offer an ideal platform to achieve exciton-polaritons correlated with magnetic orders for developing solid-state quantum, spintronic, and photonic devices. However, in the as-demonstrated systems, the coupling strength, light velocity, and effective mass of exciton-polaritons are almost inert to the external magnetic field. Here, we report the experimental observation of giant magnetic tuning of B exciton-polaritons in vdW magnet CrSBr crystals. The Rabi splitting energy is tuned up to 100 meV within a moderate 0.45 T in-plane magnetic field due to changes in excitonic states during the spin transitions. Besides, the light velocity and effective mass of exciton-polaritons are tuned by 10.3% and 26.1% below 100 meV of exciton energy. Further, the strong coupling persists at room temperature, controlled by temperature-tailored exciton-magnon and exciton-phonon coupling. These results advance the development of on-demand strong coupling systems for spin-correlated quantum optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.

Abstract: The stationary Dirac equation $(p\cdot\sigma)\psi=E\psi$, confined to a two-dimensional (2D) region, supports states propagating along the boundary and decaying exponentially away from the boundary. These edge states appear on the 2D surface of a 3D topological insulator, where massless fermionic quasiparticles are governed by the Dirac equation and confined by a magnetic insulator. We show how the continuous system can be simulated on a 2D square lattice, without running into the fermion-doubling obstruction. For that purpose we adapt the existing tangent fermion discretization on an unbounded lattice to account for a lattice termination that simulates the magnetic insulator interface.

Abstract: Chiral materials lacking mirror symmetry can exhibit unconventional spin-orbit fields, including fully momentum-aligned radial Rashba fields as seen in twisted van-der-Waals homobilayers. We theoretically study Cooper-pair transfer in superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions with crossed (tangential and radial) interfacial Rashba fields. We find that their interplay leads to what we call the unconventional supercurrent diode effect (SDE), where supercurrent rectification occurs even with collinear (w.r.t. the current) barrier magnetization, not possible for conventional spin-orbit fields. This SDE, distinct from conventional Rashba-induced effects on Cooper-pair momenta, arises from the spin precession in the magnetic barrier. We propose it as a sensitive probe of chiral spin textures.

Abstract: We report the crystal structures, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of two magnetically frustrated $A$'$A$"$M_2$F$_7$-type antiferromagnets, NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ and NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$. While NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ forms a stable pyrochlore structure (SG: $Fd \overline{3} m$, #227) with magnetic $S$ = 1 Ni$^{2+}$ ions on the frustrated pyrochlore 16$c$ site and fully disordered non-magnetic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ions on the pyrochlore 16$d$ site, NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$ favors the defect-fluorite structure (SG: $Fm \overline{3} m$, #225) with magnetic $S$ = 5/2 Mn$^{2+}$ and non-magnetic Na$^+$ and Cd$^{2+}$ ions fully disordered on the fluorite 4$a$ site. This is a result of the Mn$^{2+}$ ionic radius being too close to the average Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ionic radius, hindering the cationic site ordering towards the stable pyrochlore structure. In both cases, dominant antiferromagnetic interactions $\theta_{CW,Ni}$ = -91.2(5) K and $\theta_{CW,Mn}$ = -42.4(4) K are noted, with no magnetic transition until $T_{f,Ni}$ = 3.2 K and $T_{f,Mn}$ = 2.0 K, implying substantial frustration, with frustration indices $f_{Ni}$ = 28.5 and $f_{Mn}$ = 21. AC susceptibility measurements and bifurcation of ZFC/FC low-field magnetization indicate a glassy ground-state, precipitated by the magnetic-bond-disorder stemming from the inherent structural disorder.

arXiv:2411.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field and the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We demonstrate that they are beyond the semi-classical picture, as the exponential prefactor indicates quantum tunneling between distinct quantum states. We draw a picture of these quantum oscillations, in which the linear dispersion of the semi-Dirac band in the cadmium plays a crucial role. The oscillations arise by the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement. Positive and negative corrections to semi-classical magneto-conductance can occur by alternation between destructive and constructive interference in phase-coherent helical states. The quantum limit of Sondheimer oscillations emerges as another manifestation of Aharanov-Bohm flux quantization.

arXiv:2411.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ashkin-Teller model is a two-layer lattice model where spins in each layer interact ferromagnetically with strength $J$, and the spin-dipoles (product of spins) interact with neighbors with strength $\lambda.$ The model exhibits simultaneous magnetic and electric transitions along a self-dual line on the $\lambda$-$J$ plane with continuously varying critical exponents. In this article, we investigate the percolation of geometric clusters of spins and spin-dipoles denoted respectively as magnetic and electric clusters. We find that the largest cluster in both cases becomes macroscopic in size and spans the lattice when interaction exceeds a critical threshold given by the same self-dual line where magnetic and electric transitions occur. The fractal dimension of the critical spanning clusters is related to order parameter exponent $\beta_{m,e}$ as $D_{m,e}=d-\frac{5}{12}\frac{\beta_{m,e}}\nu,$ where $d=2$ is the spatial dimension and $\nu$ is the correlation length exponent. This relation determines all other percolation exponents and their variation wrt $\lambda.$ We show that for magnetic Percolation, the Binder cumulant, as a function of $\xi_2/L$ with $\xi_2$ being the second-moment correlation length, remains invariant all along the critical line and matches with that of the spin-percolation in the usual Ising model. The function also remains invariant for the electric percolation, forming a new superuniversality class of percolation transition.

Abstract: The spin-resolved dispersion dependencies for the topological insulator Mn$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$Bi$_2$Te$_4$ in the $\bar{\rm K}\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm K}'$ path of the Brillouin zone were studied by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy using laser radiation (Laser Spin-ARPES) with variation of the concentration of substitutional Ge atoms (x from 0.1 to 0.8) for in-plane ($s_x$) and out-of-plane ($s_z$) spin orientation. The formation of Rashba-like states is shown, which shift to lower energies with increasing Ge concentration. In the region of Ge concentrations from 50% to 75%, the contribution of these states to the formed spin-dependent dispersions becomes predominant. A pronounced in-plane ($s_y$) spin polarization, asymmetric for opposite $\pm k_\parallel$ directions, is revealed for the Dirac cone states, while the Rashba-like states exhibit a pronounced asymmetry in both in-plane ($s_y$) and out-of-plane ($s_z$) spin polarizations. Theoretical calculations confirmed the asymmetric polarization of the Rashba-like states formed in the $\bar{\rm K}\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm K}'$ path of the BZ, simultaneously for in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientation. Constant energy maps for Rashba-like states show a pronounced $s_z$ spin component along the $\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm K}$ direction, with a sign change as the contour crosses the $\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm M}$ direction. The observed spin polarization can influence the development of spin devices based on magnetic topological insulators.

arXiv:2411.11661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the pseudogap opening in the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling is captured only in the magnetic channel representation of the SDE, while its expressions in terms of the density and superconducting channels fail to correctly account for the driving antiferromagnetic fluctuations.

Wang-Landau simulations measuring the joint density of states in combination with the method of field mixing allow us to probe the phase coexistence curve in high resolution, determining the tricritical point $(\Delta_{\rm t}, T_{\rm t})$ with improved accuracy and verifying the tricritical exponents. Extensive multicanonical simulations identifying transition points across the phase diagram characterize the Ising universality class for $\Delta < \Delta_{\rm t}$ with precise determination of thermal and magnetic critical exponents expected in the second-order regime. On the other hand, for $\Delta > \Delta_{\rm t}$, a finite-size scaling analysis is dedicated to revealing the first-order signature in the surface tension that linearly increases upon lowering the temperature deeper into the first-order transition regime. Finally, a comprehensive picture of the phase diagram for the model is presented, collecting transition points obtained from the combined numerical approach in this study and previous estimates in the literature.

# Magnetic field Characterization of edge currents in quantum spin Hall insulators

arXiv:2411.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators are materials with nontrivial topological properties, characterized by helical edge currents. In 2D strips, the application of a bias voltage along the edge generates a magnetization that can be measured using quantum sensors and magnetometry techniques. In this work, we calculate the magnetic field in the vicinity of the edge and explore the potential role of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as local probes for the characterization of QSH edge states in topological insulators. We characterize the magnetic field near the edges produced by both electron currents and spin accumulation at the edge. We focus on identifying the position from the edge at which the effects of spin accumulation become detectable. We observe that a larger gap between the conduction and valence bands, along with a lower Fermi velocity, results in a stronger magnetic field, with the detectable spin accumulation being more concentrated near the edge. Conversely, a smaller gap results in a slight reduction in the magnetic field magnitude, but the field associated with spin accumulation becomes detectable further from the edge. This work provides insights that could be useful for the characterization of topological materials and the development of novel electro-optical devices.

# Energy shifts and broadening of excitonic resonances in electrostatically-doped semiconductors

arXiv:2411.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning the density of resident electrons or holes in semiconductors provides crucial insight into the composition of excitonic complexes that are observed as absorption or photoluminescence resonances in optical studies. Moreover, we can change the way these resonances shift and broaden in energy by controlling the quantum numbers of the resident carriers with magnetic fields and doping levels, and by selecting the quantum numbers of the photoexcited or recombining electron-hole (e-h) pair through optical polarization. We discuss the roles of distinguishability and optimality of excitonic complexes, showing them to be key ingredients that determine the energy shifts and broadening of optical resonances in charge-tunable semiconductors. A distinguishable e-h pair means that the electron and hole undergoing photoexcitation or recombination have quantum numbers that are not shared by any of the resident carriers. An optimal excitonic complex refers to a complex whose particles come with all available quantum numbers of the resident carriers. All optical resonances may be classified as either distinct or indistinct depending on the distinguishability of the e-h pair, and the underlying excitonic complex can be classified as either optimal or suboptimal. The universality of these classifications, inherited from the fundamental Pauli exclusion principle, allows us to understand how optical resonances shift in energy and whether they should broaden as doping is increased. This understanding is supported by conclusive evidence that the decay of optical resonances cannot be simply attributed to enhanced screening when resident carriers are added to a semiconductor. Finally, applying the classification scheme in either monolayer or moire heterobilayer systems, we relate the energy shift and amplitude of the neutral exciton resonance to the compressibility of the resident carrier gas.

arXiv:2411.11827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for new quantum spin liquid materials relies on systems with strong frustration such as spins on the kagome lattice. This allows lattice imperfections to have substantial effects which are not well understood. In recent work the 2D kagome system YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{(1-x)}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_y$] has emerged as a leading candidate hosting a Dirac spin liquid which appears to survive at least for x<0.4, associated with alternating-bond hexagon (ABH) disorder. Here in samples with x=0.58 we report an unusual coexistence of anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) order, and propose a semi-microscopic model to account for this order. Combined with a phenomenological model the results suggest growth of large FM clusters at intermediate temperatures which order eventually at lower temperatures. Generating these FM clusters relies on two ingredients: ABH disorder, and local-AFM FM-canting generated by small Kitaev interactions which can arise on the kagome lattice. The combination of experimental observation and theory suggests that Kitaev interactions and ABH disorder are necessary for describing the magnetic fluctuations in this family of materials, with potential implications for the proposed proximate spin liquid phase.

Abstract: Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit that has been shown to reach strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes. Here we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with the cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude from the earlier ones. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current by applying small magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, we provide a new tool for quantum thermodynamics aimed at realizing true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and environment.

arXiv:2411.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at a cryogenic temperature (10 K). The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at sub-nanometer gap distances of the junction formed by a Ag tip and Ag(111) surface. We clarify that the predominant contribution of the electromagnetic field enhancement of the picocavity to the detection of a single hydrogen molecule. The gap-distance dependent TERS reveals not only the evolution of the picocavity field, but also the interaction between the molecule and tip/surface, which exhibit nontrivial isotope effects. A significant red-shift and peak broadening of the H-H stretching as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretching mode is unaffected. A combination of density functional theory and reduced-dimension models reveals that a distinct anharmonicity in the mode potential of H2 is one cause of the anomalous red-shift, whereas D2 has less anharmonicity due to the geometric isotope effect.

Abstract: Interferometry has underpinned a century of discoveries, ranging from the disproval of the ether theory to the detection of gravitational waves, offering insights into wave dynamics with unrivalled precision through the measurement of phase relationships. In electronics, phase-sensitive measurements can probe the nature of transmissive topological and quantum states, but are only possible using complex device structures in magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate electronic interferometry in a single-molecule device through the study of non-equilibrium Fano resonances. We show the phase difference between an electronic orbital and a coupled Fabry-Perot resonance are tuneable through electric fields, and consequently it is possible to read out quantum information in the smallest devices, offering new avenues for the coherent manipulation down to single molecules.

# Conventional and unconventional anomalous velocities in multiband systems

## 多频带系统中的常规和非常规异常速度

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07810

arXiv:2202.07810v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous velocity has been derived so far based on the single-band approximation. In this paper, the anomalous velocity is derived accounting for multiple energy bands. It is shown that when multiple energy bands are considered, the anomalous velocity is actually derived from the velocity term which goes to zero under the single-band approximation. It is also shown that the anomalous velocity based on the single-band approximation is derived improperly from the velocity term which becomes zero in considering multiple energy bands. Furthermore, it is found that unconventional types of anomalous velocity may appear in addition to the conventional anomalous velocity. These unconventional anomalous velocities are perpendicular to the electric field and come from the singularity of the magnetic Bloch function in the magnetic Brillouin zone. It is confirmed that conventional and unconventional anomalous velocities can also be derived not only from the steady-state perturbation theory but also from the time-dependent perturbation theory in which a time-dependent vector potential yielding the uniform electric field is treated as a perturbation.

arXiv:2311.05031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two legged skewed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ladders are frustrated and exhibit exotic quantum phases in ground state due to strong quantum fluctuations and competing spin exchanges. Here, we study ground state properties of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model on 3/4, 3/5 and 5/5 skewed ladders in the presence of a Zeeman magnetic field, $B$, using exact diagonalization and the density matrix renormalization group method. We note the existence of plateaus at $m =$ 1/3 and 2/3 for 3/4 skewed ladder, at $m =$ 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 for 3/5 skewed ladder, and at $m =$ 0, 1/3, and 2/3 for 5/5 skewed ladder, where $m$ is the ratio of the observed magnetization ($M$) to the saturated magnetization (${M_\mathrm{max}}$). The plateau state is always a gapped state and the plateau width depends on the gap in the system. Surprisingly, the 3/4 and 5/5 skewed ladders show interesting quadrupolar or n-type spin nematic phases below the 1/3$^{rd}$ plateau, i.e, at very low magnetic fields. These two systems are unique as they host both a plateau and a quadrupolar phase at low magnetic fields. The linear variation of pitch angle of the spin with magnetization and behavior of binding energy of magnon pairs as function of magnetic field are also calculated in both the systems. We also study the contribution of the binding energy to two magnon condensate.

# Dichroic cavity mode splitting and lifetimes from interactions with a ferromagnetic metal

Abstract: We study the effect of ferromagnetic metals (FM) on the circularly polarized modes of an electromagnetic cavity and show that broken time-reversal symmetry leads to a dichroic response of the cavity modes. With one spin-split band, the Zeeman coupling between the FM electrons and cavity modes leads to an anticrossing for mode frequencies comparable to the spin splitting. However, this is only the case for one of the circularly polarized modes, while the other is unaffected by the FM, allowing for the determination of the spin-splitting of the FM using polarization-dependent transmission experiments. Moreover, we show that for two spin-split bands, also the lifetimes of the cavity modes display a polarization-dependent response. The change in photon lifetimes can be understood as a suppression due to level attraction with a continuum of Stoner modes with the same wavevector. The reduced lifetime of modes of only one polarization could potentially be used to engineer and control circularly polarized cavities.

arXiv:2401.03377v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed a divergent decrease of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with irreducible representation $T_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening. Although, understanding of the microscopic mechanism behind the observed softening is still an open question, present analysis strongly suggest sub-ppb level of neutral single-atomic vacancies or other unspecified non-magnetic vacancy concentrations in all investigated diamonds. Our findings also open new avenues for the quantitative determination of non-magnetic vacancies in diamonds, an important information needed for their potential application as a substrate for quantum computers and next-generation semiconductor devices.

Abstract: Fluctuations of quantum spins play a crucial role in the emergence of exotic magnetic phases and excitations. The lack of the charge degree of freedom in insulating quantum magnets, however, precludes such fluctuations from mediating electronic transport. Here we show that the quantum fluctuations of a localized frustrated magnet induce strong proximitized charge transport of the conduction electrons in a synthetic heterostructure comprising an epitaxial $\rm{Bi_{2}Ir_{2}O_{7}}$ ultrathin film on the single crystal of $\rm{Yb_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$. The proximity effects are evidenced by the scaling behavior of the $\rm{Bi_{2}Ir_{2}O_{7}}$ resistance in correspondance with the dynamic scaling of the dynamic spin correlation function of $\rm{Yb_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$, which is a result of quantum fluctuations near a multi-phase quantum critical point. The proximitized transport in $\rm{Bi_{2}Ir_{2}O_{7}}$ can be effectively tuned by magnetic field through suppressing the quantum spin fluctuations as well as inducing transitions via magnetic anisotropy in $\rm{Yb_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$. Our work establishes a new pathway for harnessing quantum spin fluctuations in magnetic insulators with electric transport, offering exciting prospects for potential applications in the realm of quantum spintronics.

Abstract: Topological semimetals, known for their intriguing properties arising from band degeneracies, have garnered significant attention. However, the discovery of a material realization and the detailed characterization of spinless Dirac semimetals have not yet been accomplished. Here, we propose from first-principles calculations that the $RE_8\mathrm{Co}X_3$ group ($RE$ = rare earth elements, $X$ = Al, Ga, or In) contains ideal spinless Dirac semimetals whose Fermi surfaces are fourfold degenerate band-crossing points (without including spin degeneracy). Despite the lack of space inversion symmetry in these materials, Dirac points are formed on the rotation-symmetry axis due to accidental degeneracies of two bands corresponding to different 2-dimensional irreducible representations of $C_{6v}$ group. We also investigate, through first-principles calculations and effective model analysis, various phase transitions caused by lattice distortion or elemental substitutions from the Dirac semimetal phase to distinct topological semimetallic phases such as nonmagnetic linked-nodal-line and Weyl semimetals (characterized by the second Stiefel-Whitney class) and ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials have a vanishingly small net magnetization, which generates weak dipolar fields and makes them robust against external magnetic perturbation and rapid magnetization dynamics, as dictated by the geometric mean of their exchange and anisotropy energies. However, experimental and theoretical techniques to detect and manipulate the antiferromagnetic order in a fully electrical manner must be developed to enable advanced spintronic devices with antiferromagnets (AFMs) as their active spin-dependent elements. Among the various AFMs, conducting AFMs offer high electrical and thermal conductivities and strong electron-spin-phonon interactions. Noncollinear metallic AFMs with negative chirality, including Mn3Sn, Mn3Ge, and Mn3GaN, offer rich physics that arises from their topology. In this review article, we introduce the crystal structure and the physical phenomena observed in negative chirality AFMs. Experimental and theoretical advances related to current-induced dynamics on the spin structure of Mn3Sn are discussed. We then present a potential AFM spintronic device that can serve as a non-volatile memory, high-frequency signal generator, neuron emulator, and even a probabilistic bit, depending on the design parameters and the input stimuli, i.e., amplitude and pulse width of the injected spin current and the external magnetic field. In this device, spin-orbit torques can be used to manipulate the order parameter, while the device state can be read via tunneling magnetoresistance. We also present analytic models that relate the performance characteristics of the device with its design parameters, thus enabling a rapid technology-device assessment. Effects of Joule heating and thermal noise on the device characteristics are briefly discussed. We close the paper by summarizing the status of research and present our outlook in this rapidly evolving research field.

# Magnon spectrum of altermagnets beyond linear spin wave theory: Magnon-magnon interactions via time-dependent matrix product states vs. atomistic spin dynamics

Abstract: The energy-momentum dispersion of magnons, as collective low-energy excitations of magnetic material, is computed from an effective quantum spin Hamiltonian but simplified via linearized Holstein-Primakoff transformations to describe noninteracting magnons. The dispersion produced by such linear spin wave theory (LSWT) is then plotted as ``sharp bands'' of infinitely long-lived quasiparticles. However, magnons are prone to many-body interactions with other quasiparticles -- such as electrons, phonons or other magnons -- which can lead to shifting (i.e., band renormalization) and broadening of ``sharp bands'' as the signature of finite quasiparticle lifetime. The magnon-magnon interactions can be particularly important in antiferromagnets (AFs), and, therefore, possibly in newly classified altermagnets sharing many features of collinear AFs. Here, we employ nonperturbative quantum many-body calculations, via time-dependent matrix product states (TDMPS), to obtain magnon spectral function for RuO$_2$ altermagnet whose effective quantum spin Hamiltonian is put onto 4-leg cylinder. Its upper band is shifted away from upper ``sharp band'' of LSWT, as well as broadened, which is explained as the consequence of {\em hybridization} of the latter with three-magnon continuum. This implies that two-magnon Raman scattering spectra {\em cannot} be computed from LSWT bands, which offers a litmus test for the relevance of magnon-magnon interactions. Finally, we employ atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, based on classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, to obtain magnon spectrum at finite temperature and/or at a fraction of the cost of TDMPS calculations. Despite including magnon-magnon interactions via nonlinearity of LLG equation, ASD simulations {\em cannot} match the TDMPS-computed magnon spectrum, thereby signaling {\em nonclassical} effects harbored by AFs and altermagnets.

Abstract: The Kondo lattice, describing a grid of the local magnetic moments coupling to itinerant electrons, is a fertile ground of strongly correlated states in condensed matter physics. While the Kagome lattice has long been predicted to host Kondo physics with exotic magnetism and nontrivial topology, no experimental realization has been achieved. Here, we report the discovery of CsCr6Sb6, a van der Waals-like Kagome Kondo lattice featuring extremely flat, isolated bands at the Fermi level (EF) that composed entirely of Cr-3d electrons. We observe heavy fermions with the effective mass over 100 times greater than those of its vanadium counterpart. We also observe Kondo insulating behavior in an ultra-low carrier density of 1019 cm-3 and dimensionality-induced Kondo breakdown. More interestingly, the frustrated magnetism observed in the bulk give way to a hidden A-type antiferromagnetic ordering in few layers, in sharp contrast to the common sense of weakened magnetism with thinning. The realization of Kondo physics in Kagome lattice opens avenues for exploring diverse quantum criticalities in a strongly-correlated frustrated system.

Abstract: We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the
  Nagle-Kardar model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's). The model represents one-dimensional Ising chain with long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength $J_{l}/N>0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength $J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}>0$) or antiferromagnetic ($J_{s}<0$). In the infinite system limit the model exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s>-\ln3/4$, which ends at a tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly, with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field. It is \textit{repulsive} near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular regimes fast away from them and becoming \textit{attractive}, displaying in which the maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion.
  This represents a violation of the widely-accepted ``boundary condition rule,'' which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for conflicting BC's \textit{independently} of the actual bulk universality class of the phase transition under investigation.

Abstract: Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezer array have been used as a quantum simulator of the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Ising model with longitudinal and transverse fields. We suggest how to implement the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction whose sign is opposite to that of the nearest neighbor one in the Rydberg atom systems. We show that this can be achieved by weakly coupling one Rydberg state with another Rydberg state. We further study the surface criticality associated with the first-order quantum phase transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, which emerges due to the sign-inverted NNN interaction. From the microscopic model, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation, which describes static and dynamic properties of the antiferromagnetic order parameter near the transition. Using both analytical GL theory and numerical method based on a mean-field theory, we calculate the order parameter in the proximity of a boundary of the system in order to show that the healing length of the order parameter logarithmically diverges, signaling the surface criticality.

Abstract: The insulating magnetic pyrochlore Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ has gained attention as a quantum spin ice candidate with dipole-octupole character that arises from the crystal electric field ground state doublet for the Ce$^{3+}$ Kramers ion. This permits both spin ice phases based on magnetic dipoles and those based on more-exotic octupoles. This work reports low-temperature neutron diffraction measurements on single crystal Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ with $Q$-coverage both at low $Q$ where the magnetic form factor for dipoles is near maximal and at high $Q$ covering the region where the magnetic form factor for Ce$^{3+}$ octupoles is near maximal. This study was motivated by recent powder neutron diffraction studies of other Ce-based dipole-octupole pyrochlores, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$, which each showed temperature-dependent diffuse diffraction at high $Q$ that was interpreted as arising from octupolar correlations. Our measurements use an optimized single crystal diffuse scattering instrument that allows us to screen against strong Bragg scattering from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. The temperature-difference neutron diffraction reveals a low-$Q$ peak consistent with dipolar spin ice correlations reported in previous work, and an alternation between positive and negative net intensity at higher $Q$. These features are consistent with our numerical-linked-cluster calculations using pseudospin interaction parameters previously reported for Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Importantly, neither the measured data nor any of the NLC calculations show evidence for increased scattering at high $Q$ resulting from octupolar correlations. We conclude that at the lowest attainable temperatures for our measurement ($T = 0.05$ K), octupolar correlations are not present in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ on the level of our observation threshold of $\sim$ 0.1$\%$ of the low-$Q$ dipole scattering.

Abstract: We investigate the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall setups, where we subject a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and a weak (i.e., non-quantizing) magnetic field $\mathbf B $. For computing the in-plane transport components, we have added an elastic deformation which gives rise to a chirality-dependent effective magnetic field $ \mathbf B^{\text{tot}} = \mathbf B + \chi \, \mathbf B_5 $, where $\chi $ is the chirality of an RSW node. We have included the effects of orbital magnetic moment (OMM), in conjunction with the Berry curvature (BC), both of which appear as a consequence of nontrivial topology of the bandstructure. Due to the presence of four bands, RSW semimetals provide a richer structure for obtaining the linear-response coefficients, compared to the Weyl semimetals. In particular, we have found that the OMM-contributed terms may oppose or add up to the BC-only parts, depending on which band we are considering. Last, but not the least, we have determined the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, whose nature corroborates the findings of some recent experimental results.

arXiv:2408.10062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of helical edge modes in a Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice, driven by a topological mechanism similar to that proposed by Dong et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 206701 (2023)] for chiral spin waves in ferromagnets. The spin-frame field theory of a three-sublattice antiferromagnet allows for a topological term in the energy that modifies the boundary conditions for certain polarizations of spin waves and gives rise to edge modes. These edge modes are helical: modes with left and right circular polarizations propagate in opposite directions along the boundary in a way reminiscent of the electron edge modes in two-dimensional topological insulators. The field-theoretic arguments are verified in a realistic lattice model of a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with superexchange interactions that exhibits helical edge modes. The strength of the topological term is proportional to the disparity between two inequivalent superexchange paths. These findings suggest potential avenues for realizing magnonic edge states in frustrated antiferromagnets without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions or nontrivial magnon band topology.

Abstract: In this work we study the temperature independent resistivity of rare-earth magnetic (Gd, Tb, Dy) and non-magnetic (Lu) impurities diluted in dhcp Lanthanum. We considered a two-band system where the conduction is entirely due to $s$-electrons while the screening of the charge difference induced by the impurity is made by the $d$-electrons. We obtain an expression of the resistivity using the $T$-matrix formalism from the Dyson equation. As the electronic properties depend strongly on the band structure, we have considered two types of bands structure, a "parabolic" band and a more realistic one calculated by first principles with VASP. We verify that the exchange parameters appearing as cross products strongly affect the magnitude of the spin resistivity term; And that the role of the band structure in resonant scattering or virtual bound states, depends on the band structure.

Abstract: The manganese pnictide CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$, with Mn atoms arranged in a puckered honeycomb structure, exhibits narrow-gap antiferromagnetism, and it is currently a promising candidate for the study of complex electronic and magnetic phenomena, such as magnetotransport effects and potential spin spirals under high pressure. In this paper, we perform a detailed research of the magnetic properties of CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$ using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the Hubbard U correction and spin-orbit coupling, which accurately describe the magnetic interactions. Our results obtained for a large number of magnetic configurations are accurately captured by a modified Heisenberg model that includes on-site magnetization terms to describe magnetic energy excitations. We further investigate the role of the spin-orbit coupling, and find that the magnetic anisotropy of CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$ shows an easy plane, with the preferred magnetization direction being exchanged between axes in the plane by applying small strain values. This strain-tunable magnetization, driven by the interplay between spin-orbit interactions and lattice distortions, highlights the potential for controlling magnetic states in Mn-pnictides for future applications in spintronic and magnetoelectric devices.

Abstract: Single-layer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, lacking point inversion symmetry, provide an efficient platform for valleytronics, where the electronic, magnetic, valley and lattice degrees of freedom can be selectively manipulated by using polarized light. This task is however thought to be limited in parent bulk compounds where the point inversion symmetry is restored. Exploiting the underlying quantum physics in bulk materials is thus one of the biggest paradigmatic challenges. Here we show that a sizable optical Kerr rotation can be efficiently generated in a wide energy range on ultrafast timescales in bulk WSe$_2$, by means of circularly-polarized light. We rationalize these findings as a result of the hidden spin/layer/valley quantum entanglement. The spectral analysis reveals clear features at the three characteristic frequencies corresponding to the A-, B- and C-exciton edges. The origin and the relative sign of all these features is shown to stem from the selective Pauli blocking of intralayer and interlayer optical transitions. The long lifetime of the broadband Kerr response ($\tau \sim 500$ fs) provides a strong indication that coupled photo-induced electron and hole densities survive in bulk compounds longer than previously expected. The present report demonstrates that a hidden quantum entanglement is operative also in bulk centrosymmetric layered materials, opening the way for an effective exploitation of bulk WSe$_2$ in optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: Since the initial discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials, significant effort has been made to incorporate the three properties of magnetism, band structure topology, and strong electron correlations $-$ to leverage emergent quantum phenomena and expand their potential applications. However, the discovery of a single vdW material that intrinsically hosts all three ingredients has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we report the discovery of a Kondo-interacting topological antiferromagnet in the vdW 5$f$ electron system UOTe. It has a high antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature of 150 K, with a unique AFM configuration that breaks the combined parity and time reversal ($PT$) symmetry in an even number of layers while maintaining zero net magnetic moment. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal Dirac bands near the Fermi level, which combined with our theoretical calculations demonstrate UOTe as an AFM Dirac semimetal. Within the AFM order, we observed the presence of the Kondo interaction, as evidenced by the emergence of a 5$f$ flat band near the Fermi level below 100 K and hybridization between the Kondo band and the Dirac band. Our density functional theory calculations in its bilayer form predict UOTe as a rare example of a fully-compensated AFM Chern insulator.

Abstract: The interplay of chiralities in light and quantum matter provides an opportunity to design and manipulate chirality-dependent properties in quantum materials. Herein we report the chirality-dependent Floquet engineering on topological fermions with the high Chern number in chiral crystal CoSi via circularly polarized light (CPL) pumping. Intense light pumping does not compromise the gapless nature of topological fermions in CoSi, but displaces the crossing points in momentum space along the direction of light propagation. The Floquet chirality index is proposed to signify the interplay between the chiralities of topological fermion, crystal, and incident light, which determines the amplitudes and directions of light-induced momentum shifts. Regarding the time-reversal symmetry breaking induced by the CPL pumping, momentum shifts of topological fermions result in the birth of transient anomalous Hall signals in non-magnetic CoSi within an ultrafast time scale, which Mid-infrared (IR) pumping and terahertz (THz) Kerr or Faraday probe spectroscopy could experimentally detect. Our findings provide insights into exploring novel applications in optoelectronic devices by leveraging the degree of freedom of chirality in the non-equilibrium regime.

arXiv:2409.01375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the coherence dynamics of a central spin coupled to a spin chain with a time-dependent noisy magnetic field, focusing on how noise influences the system's decoherence. Our results show that decoherency due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment allows partial revivals of coherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depends on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows. Our findings have potential applications in the noise spectroscopy of external signals.

arXiv:2410.14850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal propagation of energy and information is fundamental to a wide range of quantum technology applications. In this work, we explore the quantum many-body dynamics of a qubit ensemble coupled to a shared bath that mediates coherent and dissipative inter-qubit interactions with both symmetric and anti-symmetric components. We find that the interplay between anti-symmetric (symmetric) coherent and symmetric (anti-symmetric) dissipative interactions results in non-reciprocal couplings, which, in turn, generate a spatially asymmetric emission pattern. We demonstrate that this pattern arises from non-reciprocal interactions coupling different quantum many-body states within a specific excitation manifold. Focusing on solid-state baths, we show that their lack of time-reversal and inversion symmetry is a key ingredient for generating non-reciprocal dynamics in the qubit ensemble. With the plethora of quantum materials that exhibit this symmetry breaking at equilibrium, our approach paves the way for realizing cooperative non-reciprocal transport in qubit ensembles without requiring time-modulated external drives or complex engineering. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to a generic non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic bath as a concrete example, we demonstrate that our predictions can be tested in near-future experiments. As the spatial asymmetry in the relaxation dynamics of the qubit ensemble is a direct probe of symmetry breaking in the solid-state bath, our work also opens the door to developing model-agnostic quantum sensing schemes capable of detecting bath properties invisible to current state-of-the-art protocols, which operate solid-state defects as single-qubit sensors.

arXiv:2411.10538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores 4 different magnetic field topologies for application to spherical inertial confinement fusion implosions: axial, mirror, cusp and closed field lines. A mirror field is found to enhance the impact of magnetization over an axial field; this is because the mirror field more closely follows the hot-spot surface. A cusp field, while simple to generate, is not found to have any benefits over the tried-and-tested axial field. Closed field lines are found to be of the greatest benefit to hot-spot performance, with the simulated design undergoing a 2x increase in ion temperature before alpha-heating is considered. The plasma properties of the simulation with closed field lines are radically different from the unmagnetized counterpart, with electron temperatures in excess of 100 keV, suggesting that a fundamental redesign of the capsule implosion is possible if this method is pursued.

arXiv:2411.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilient divertor features connected to open chaotic edge structures in the Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) are investigated. For the first time, an expanded vessel wall was considered that would give space for implementation of a physical divertor target structure. The analysis was done for four different magnetic configurations with very different chaotic plasma edges. A resilient plasma wall interaction pattern was identified across all configurations. This manifests as qualitatively very similar footprint behavior across the different plasma equilibria. Overall, the resilient field lines of interest with high connection length $L_C$ lie within a helical band along the wall for all configurations. This resiliency can be used to identify the best location of a divertor. The details of the magnetic footprint's resilient helical band is subject to specific field line structures which are linked to the penetration depth of field lines into the plasma and directly influence the heat and particle flux patterns. The differences arising from these details are characterized by introducing a new metric, the minimum radial connection $\text{min}(\delta_N)$ of a field line from the last closed flux surface. The relationship, namely the deviation from a scaling law, between $\text{min}(\delta_N)$ and $L_C$ of the field lines in the plasma edge field line behavior suggests that the field lines are associated with structures such as resonant islands, cantori, and turnstiles. This helps determine the relevant magnetic flux channels based on the radial location of these chaotic edge structures and the divertor target footprint. These details will need to be taken into account for resilient divertor design.

# Selective Spin Wave Non-reciprocity in Engineered Chiral Magnonic Crystal without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction

## 没有dzyaloshinskii-moriya相互作用的工程手性磁振子晶体中的选择性自旋波非互易性

arXiv:2411.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality is pivotal in magnonics, particularly for achieving spin wave non-reciprocity which is critical in advancing spin wave based communication and logic operations. In general, chirality in magnetic systems is realized through the interfacial antisymmetric exchange interaction, namely, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI), which is an intrinsic phenomenon occurring at the buried interface of ferromagnet and heavy metal. In this work, using micromagnetic simulations, we present a new route to achieve spin wave nonreciprocity using an engineered chiral magnonic crystal, where we artificially created in-plane twisted spin textures by imposing certain handedness in the structural geometry. The manipulation of the relative arrangement of these chiral enantiomers led to spin wave non-reciprocity, which could be tuned by selecting different channels within the crystal, with additional versatility in the resonant mode frequency. Further adjustment of the external magnetic field strength confirms that the spin wave directionality originates from the spin texture. This enables additional control over the band gap and mode propagation characteristics by external field tuning. Our work provides a novel and innovative route to simultaneously access opposite spin wave directions in consecutive channels, which makes this system competent for real on-chip magnonic diode, with predefined paths for counter-propagating information.

arXiv:2411.10799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for reconstructing the fluctuation components of the electron velocity distribution function f(v_perp), and the electron entropy, which is a functional of f(v_perp) expressed as -f(v_perp)lnf(v_perp)dv_perp, using the harmonic spectrum from pure X-mode electron cyclotron emission (ECE) in optically thin plasmas. Here, v_perp represents the electron velocity perpendicular to the background magnetic field. This formulation employs the maximum entropy method in velocity space using the Hankel transform, which converts from v_perp space to p space (where p is the index of the wavenumber in velocity space). Numerical tests validated the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is applicable across a wide range of magnetized plasma conditions, including conditions with both non-relativistic and relativistic electrons, except in cases of harmonic overlap or under optically thick conditions. Notably, this method does not require radiometer calibration for ECE measurements. This method fascilitates the experimental evaluation of electron entropy transport in fusion plasma experiments. Moreover, when combined with measurements in k-space (spatial distribution), this approach enables entropy distribution acquisition in phase space (k-p space).

arXiv:2411.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at a cryogenic temperature (10 K). The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at sub-nanometer gap distances of the junction formed by a Ag tip and Ag(111) surface. We clarify that the predominant contribution of the electromagnetic field enhancement of the picocavity to the detection of a single hydrogen molecule. The gap-distance dependent TERS reveals not only the evolution of the picocavity field, but also the interaction between the molecule and tip/surface, which exhibit nontrivial isotope effects. A significant red-shift and peak broadening of the H-H stretching as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretching mode is unaffected. A combination of density functional theory and reduced-dimension models reveals that a distinct anharmonicity in the mode potential of H2 is one cause of the anomalous red-shift, whereas D2 has less anharmonicity due to the geometric isotope effect.

These results mark a significant milestone in unlocking the potential of 4H-SiC through turnkey soliton microcomb generation and empowering future advancements in areas such as cavity optomechanics using this versatile and quantum-friendly material platform.

Abstract: Interferometry has underpinned a century of discoveries, ranging from the disproval of the ether theory to the detection of gravitational waves, offering insights into wave dynamics with unrivalled precision through the measurement of phase relationships. In electronics, phase-sensitive measurements can probe the nature of transmissive topological and quantum states, but are only possible using complex device structures in magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate electronic interferometry in a single-molecule device through the study of non-equilibrium Fano resonances. We show the phase difference between an electronic orbital and a coupled Fabry-Perot resonance are tuneable through electric fields, and consequently it is possible to read out quantum information in the smallest devices, offering new avenues for the coherent manipulation down to single molecules.

# Coherence effects in LIPSS formation on silicon wafers upon picosecond laser pulse irradiations

## 皮秒激光脉冲辐照对硅片上LIPSS形成的相干效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11700

arXiv:2411.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using different laser irradiation patterns to modify of silicon surface, it has been demonstrated that, at rather small overlapping between irradiation spots, highly regular laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) can be produced already starting from the second laser pulse, provided that polarization direction coincides with the scanning direction. If the laser irradiation spot is shifted from the previous one perpendicular to light polarization, LIPSS are not formed even after many pulses. This coherence effect is explained by a three-wave interference, - surface electromagnetic waves (SEWs) generated within the irradiated spot, SEWs scattered from the crater edge formed by the previous laser pulse, and the incoming laser pulse, - providing conditions for amplification of the periodic light-absorption pattern. To study possible consequences of SEW scattering from the laser-modified regions, where the refractive index can change due to material melting, amorphization, and the residual stress formed by previous laser pulses, hydrodynamic modelling and simulations have been performed within the melting regime. The simulations show that stress and vertical displacement could be amplified upon laser scanning. Both mechanisms, three-wave interference and stress accumulation, could enable an additional degree of controlling surface structuring.

# Bulk Motions in the Black Hole Jet Sheath as a Candidate for the Comptonizing Corona

arXiv:2411.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of two-dimensional general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of the sheath separating the black hole jet from the surrounding medium. We find that the electromagnetic power flowing through the jet sheath is comparable to the overall accretion power, and is an important site of energy dissipation as revealed by the copious appearance of reconnection layers and plasmoid chains: $\sim20\%$ of the radially flowing electromagnetic power is found to be dissipated between 2 and 10 $R_{\rm g}$. The plasma in these dissipation regions moves along a nearly paraboloidal surface with trans-relativistic bulk motions dominated by the radial component, whose dimensionless 4-velocity is $\sim1.2\pm0.5$. In the frame moving with the mean (radially-dependent) velocity, the distribution of stochastic bulk motions resembles a Maxwellian with an `effective bulk temperature' of $\sim$100 keV. Scaling the global simulation to Cygnus X-1 parameters gives a rough estimate of the Thomson optical depth across the jet sheath $\sim0.01-0.1$, and it may increase in future magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent radiative losses. These properties suggest that the dissipative jet sheath may be a viable `coronal' region, capable of upscattering seed thermal X-ray photons ($\sim$1 keV) into a hard, nonthermal tail, as seen during the hard states of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.

arXiv:2411.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic investigation of the role of Hubbard U corrections in electronic structure calculations of two-dimensional (2D) materials containing 3d transition metals. Specifically, we use density functional theory (DFT) with the PBE and PBE+U approximations to calculate the crystal structure, band gaps, and magnetic parameters of 638 monolayers. Based on a comprehensive comparison to experiments we first establish that inclusion of the U correction worsens the accuracy for the lattice constant. Consequently, PBE structures are used for subsequent property evaluations. The band gaps show significant dependence on the U-parameter. In particular, for 134 (21%) of the materials the U parameter leads to a metal-insulator transition. For the magnetic materials we calculate the magnetic moment, magnetic exchange coupling, and magnetic anisotropy parameters. In contrast to the band gaps, the size of the magnetic moments shows only weak dependence on U. Both the exchange energies and magnetic anisotropy parameters are systematically reduced by the U correction. On this basis we conclude that the Hubbard U correction will lead to lower predicted Curie temperatures in 2D materials. All the calculated properties are available in the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB).

# A Wave Scattering Approach to Modelling Surface Roughness in Orbital Aerodynamics

## 在轨道空气动力学中模拟表面粗糙度的波散射方法

arXiv:2411.10874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing density of space objects in low-Earth orbit highlights the critical need for accurate orbit predictions to minimise operational disruptions. One significant challenge lies in accurately modelling the interaction of gas particles with the surfaces of these objects, as errors in aerodynamic coefficient modelling directly impact orbit prediction accuracy. Current approaches rely on empirical models, such as those by Sentman and Cercignani-Lampis-Lord, incorporating one or two adjustable parameters typically calibrated with orbital acceleration data. However, these models fall short in capturing essential gas-solid interaction processes, including multiple reflections, shadowing, and backscattering caused by surface roughness. We present a novel, physics-based gas-surface interaction model that utilises electromagnetic wave theory to account for macroscopic effects of surface roughness on gas particle scattering distributions. This approach not only offers a more accurate representation of gas-surface interactions but also allows parameter determination through a combination of ground-based surface roughness measurements and molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic scale. The model validity is tested across the entire parameter space using a test-particle Monte Carlo method on a simulated rough surface. Furthermore, it successfully reproduces experimental results from the literature on the scattering of Argon and Helium from smooth and rough Kapton and Aluminium surfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the model's impact on aerodynamic coefficients for simple geometric shapes, comparing the results with those from the Sentman and Cercignani-Lampis-Lord models. This comparison reveals that inconsistencies previously observed between these models and tracking data for spherical satellites can be attributed to surface roughness effects, which our model effectively accounts for.

Abstract: The recent discovery of topological flat bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and multilayer graphene has sparked significant research interest. We propose a new platform for realizing tunable topological moire flat bands: twisted type-II Rashba homobilayers. The interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions generates an effective pseudo-antiferromagnetic field, opening a gap within the Dirac cone with non-zero Berry curvature. Using twisted BiTeI bilayers as an example, we predict the emergence of flat topological bands with a remarkably narrow bandwidth (below 20 meV). Notably, the system undergoes a transition from a valley Hall insulator to a quantum spin Hall insulator as the twisting angle increases. This transition arises from a competition between the twisting-driven effective spin-orbit coupling and sublattice onsite energies presented in type-II Rashba moir\'e structures. The high tunability of Rashba materials in terms of the spin-orbit coupling strength, interlayer interaction, and twisting angle expands the range of materials suitable for realizing and manipulating correlated topological properties.

arXiv:2411.11104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the ground state and thermodynamic properties of a spin-pseudospin chain representing a model of a one-dimensional dilute magnet with two types of nonmagnetic charged impurities. For this purpose, a method utilizing the transfer-matrix properties is employed. Despite the wide variety of intriguing frustrated phase states, we show that the model showcases pseudotransitions solely between simple charge and magnetic quasiorders. These pseudotransitions are characterized by distinct features in the thermodynamic and magnetic quantities, resembling first- and second-order phase transitions. In addition to pseudotransitions for the ``pure'' system, similar to those observed in other one-dimensional spin models, this study also reveals the presence of ``second-order'' pseudotransitions for the dilute case. We show that the nature of these discovered pseudotransitions is associated with the phase separation in the chain into regions of (anti)ferromagnetic and charge-ordered phases. The ability to compare the results of an exact transfer-matrix calculation with a simple phenomenological description within the framework of Maxwell construction contributes to a deeper understanding of both the physical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the analytical methods used.

Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.

Abstract: We develop a self-consistent theoretical formalism to model the dynamics of heat transfer in dissipative, dispersive, anisotropic nanoscale media, such as metamaterials. We employ our envelope dyadic Green's function method to solve Maxwell's macroscopic equations for the propagation of fluctuating electromagnetic fields in these media. We assume that the photonic radiative heat transfer mechanism in these media is complemented by dynamic phononic mechanisms of heat storage and conduction, accounting for effects of local heat generation. By employing the Poynting theorem and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the radiative heat flux and the coupling term of photonic and phononic subsystems, which contains the heating rate and the radiative heat power contributions. We apply our formalism to the paraxial heat transfer in uniaxial media and present relevant closed-form expressions. By considering a Gaussian transverse temperature profile, we also obtain and solve a system of integro-differential heat diffusion equations to model the paraxial heat transfer in uniaxial reciprocal media. By applying the developed analytical model to radiative-conductive heat tranfer in nanolayered media constructed by layers of silica and germanium, we compute the temperature profiles for the three first orders of expansion and the total temperature profile as well. The results of this research can be of interest in areas of science and technology related to thermophotovoltaics, energy harvesting, radiative cooling, and thermal management at micro- and nanoscale.

Abstract: Equations of the advection-diffusion form underlie both magnetic field and plasma transport. Solutions are exponentially sensitive to small diffusive terms when the advection velocity is chaotic as natural flows generally are. An exact mathematical relation allows Faraday's law to be written in the form of an advection-diffusion equation, but the fundamental importance of chaos to magnetic reconnection is not widely appreciated. In a universe with three spatial coordinates, magnetic reconnection should be and is ubiquitous in evolving magnetic fields. Magnetic fields that depend on only two spatial coordinates are an exception for then a chaotic advective velocity requires an exponential increase in the magnetic field energy. The early focus on two-dimensional models of reconnection led to theories that ignore not only chaos, but also magnetic helicity conservation and non-dissipative magnetic energy transfer. All three are essential concepts for understanding magnetic reconnection, especially when the plasma is turbulent. A full theory of magnetic reconnection in turbulent plasmas is not the intent of this paper. Its intent is develop equations and concepts that are required to develop theories of reconnection and clarify the relation between the physics of magnetic field and plasma transport.

Abstract: The interplay of chiralities in light and quantum matter provides an opportunity to design and manipulate chirality-dependent properties in quantum materials. Herein we report the chirality-dependent Floquet engineering on topological fermions with the high Chern number in chiral crystal CoSi via circularly polarized light (CPL) pumping. Intense light pumping does not compromise the gapless nature of topological fermions in CoSi, but displaces the crossing points in momentum space along the direction of light propagation. The Floquet chirality index is proposed to signify the interplay between the chiralities of topological fermion, crystal, and incident light, which determines the amplitudes and directions of light-induced momentum shifts. Regarding the time-reversal symmetry breaking induced by the CPL pumping, momentum shifts of topological fermions result in the birth of transient anomalous Hall signals in non-magnetic CoSi within an ultrafast time scale, which Mid-infrared (IR) pumping and terahertz (THz) Kerr or Faraday probe spectroscopy could experimentally detect. Our findings provide insights into exploring novel applications in optoelectronic devices by leveraging the degree of freedom of chirality in the non-equilibrium regime.

# Trapped-ion laser cooling in structured light fields

Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.

# Elastic Softening in Synthetic Diamonds

## 合成钻石的弹性软化

arXiv:2401.03377v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed a divergent decrease of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with irreducible representation $T_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening. Although, understanding of the microscopic mechanism behind the observed softening is still an open question, present analysis strongly suggest sub-ppb level of neutral single-atomic vacancies or other unspecified non-magnetic vacancy concentrations in all investigated diamonds. Our findings also open new avenues for the quantitative determination of non-magnetic vacancies in diamonds, an important information needed for their potential application as a substrate for quantum computers and next-generation semiconductor devices.

# The Solar and Geomagnetic Storms in May 2024: A Flash Data Report

## 2024年5月的太阳和地磁风暴: 一份Flash数据报告

arXiv:2407.07665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In May 2024, the scientific community observed intense solar eruptions that resulted in a great geomagnetic storm and auroral extension, highlighting the need to document and quantify these events. This study mainly focuses on their quantification. The source active region (AR 13664) evolved from 113 to 2761 millionths of the solar hemisphere between 4 May and 14 May. AR 13664's magnetic free energy surpassed 10^33 erg on 7 May, triggering 12 X-class flares on 8 -- 15 May. Multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) were produced from this AR, accelerating solar energetic particles toward Earth. According to satellite and interplanetary scintillation data, at least 4 ICMEs erupted from 13664 eventually overcoming each other and combining. The shock arrival at 17:05 UT on 10 May significantly compressed the magnetosphere down to ~ 5.04 RE, and triggered a deep Forbush Decrease. GOES satellite data and ground-based neutron monitors confirmed a ground-level enhancement from 2 UT to 10 UT on 11 May 2024. The ICMEs induced exceptional geomagnetic storms, peaking at a Dst index of -412 nT at 2 UT on 11 May, marking the sixth-largest storm since 1957. The AE and AL indices showed great auroral extensions that located the AE/AL stations into the polar cap. We gathered auroral records at that time and reconstructed the equatorward boundary of the visual auroral oval to 29.8{\deg} invariant latitude. We compared naked-eye and camera auroral visibility, providing critical caveats on their difference. We also confirmed global enhancements of storm-enhanced density of the ionosphere.

# Large-scale characterization of chemical bonding and topology in the Materials Project database

Topology is key to the determination of many physical and chemical properties of materials, such as electrical and optical properties, magnetic properties, thermal and mechanical behaviour, etc. However, despite the growing number of databases of crystalline materials available, there has been very little systematic effort to date to analyze their topology. In this work, we have leveraged recent algorithmic advances in the analysis of chemical bonding and topology determination in order to perform high-throughput analysis of topology of materials on a large scale databases of existing and hypothetical materials, the Materials Project data set of more than 150,000 structures. Beyond the statistical analysis of the most frequent topologies and coordination environments, the publication of this topological data will allow researchers to search for materials by topology and chemical environment, paving the way to enhanced performance in materials screening for applications. We demonstrated two examples of the usefulness of topological considerations in such computational screening.

# The swarmable magnetic-driven nanorobots for facilitating trans- intestinal mucosal delivery of oral vaccines to enhance mucosal and systemic immune responses

The continuous secretion of mucus by the intestinal mucosa and the intestinal motility combine to limit the absorption of orally administered vaccines. To extend the residence time of vaccines within the gastrointestinal tract and to improve their mucosal transit, we have developed a technology capable of swiftly and actively traversing the intestinal mucus barrier. In this study, we synthesized a biodegradable magnetic driven nanorobot (MNC@CaMn) loaded with antigen and constructed a magnetic driven nanorobot vaccine delivery platform. Under the precise regulation of the magnetic field, the residence time of the vaccines in the intestine was significantly prolonged, and the vaccine exhibited a swarming motility that could rapidly converge and cross the intestinal mucus barrier in a targeted manner, thus greatly facilitating antigen delivery and presentation and significantly activating CD8&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;T lymphocytes. In addition, the rough surface of the nanorobot ensured stable antigen loading, while the Mn2+ in the particles was able to stimulate efficient mucosal and systemic immune responses due to its excellent adjuvant effect. The magnetic driven nanorobot vaccine delivery system constructed in this study provides a new strategy for the development of efficient oral and mucosal vaccines.

# A Photonic Crystal Receiver for Rydberg Atom-Based Sensing

## 用于Rydberg原子传感的光子晶体接收器

Rydberg atom-based sensors use atoms dressed by lasers to detect and measure radio frequency electromagnetic fields. The absorptive properties of the atomic gas, configured as a Rydberg atom-based sensor, change in the presence of a radio frequency electromagnetic field. While these sensors are reasonably sensitive, the best conventional radio frequency sensors still outperform Rydberg atom-based sensors with respect to sensitivity. One approach to increase the sensitivity of Rydberg atom-based sensors is to engineer the vapor cell that contains the atomic gas. In this work, we introduce a passive, all-dielectric amplifier integrated into a Rydberg atom-based sensor vapor cell. The vapor cell is a combination of a slot waveguide and a photonic crystal. The structural features of the vapor cell yield a power amplification of ~&thinsp;24 dB. The radio frequency electromagnetic field is coupled adiabatically into the slot waveguide and slowed to increase the interaction between the radio frequency field and the atoms to effectively amplify the incoming signal, i.e., increase the Rabi frequency on the radio frequency transition. The work shows the utility of vapor cell engineering for atom-based quantum technologies and paves the way for other such devices.
