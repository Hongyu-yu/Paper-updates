# Thermal Hall response of an abelian chiral spin liquid at finite temperatures

## 阿白手性自旋液体在有限温度下的热霍尔响应

arXiv:2411.15304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal Hall transport has emerged as a valuable tool for probing the fractionalized excitations in chiral quantum spin liquids. Observing quantized thermal Hall response, expected at temperatures below the spectral gap, has been challenging and controversial. The finite temperature behavior, especially in the quantum critical regime above the spectral gap, can provide useful signatures of the underlying topological order. In this context, we study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a kagome lattice that is believed to be a U$(1)$ Dirac spin liquid over a wide intermediate energy range. Scalar spin chirality perturbations turn this into a gapped abelian chiral spin liquid (CSL) with semionic topological order. Using a recently developed large-$N$ technique [Guo et al., Phys. Rev. B 101, 195126 (2020)], we obtain explicit expressions for the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ at finite temperatures taking into account both matter and gauge fluctuations. At low temperatures below the spectral gap, the quantized thermal Hall response agrees with that expected from conformal field theory and gravitational anomaly arguments. Our main finding is that in a large temperature window spanning the spectral gap and the Curie temperature scales where quantum critical fluctuations dominate, $\kappa_{xy}/T$ obeys a power-law with logarithmic corrections. Our analysis also provides a route to understanding the thermal Hall response at temperatures in the quantum critical regime of other spin liquid phases.

# 3-Dimensional Model Based Iterative Reconstruction of Magnetisation in a Nanowire Structure Using Holographic Vector Field Electron Tomography Measurements

Abstract: Methods for characterisation of 3D magnetic spin structures are necessary to advance the performance of 3D magnetic nanoscale technologies. However, as the component dimensions approach the nanometre range, it becomes more challenging to analyse 3D magnetic configurations with the appropriate spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a method based on Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in which model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) is used to reconstruct the most probable magnetisation in an exemplar nanostructure. This method is based on relating electron phase measurements to the magnetic configuration of the nanostructure, and therefore, the method is subject to certain limitations. In this proof-of-concept experiment, MBIR was tested on an L-shaped ferromagnetic cobalt nanowire, fabricated using focused electron beam induced deposition. Off-axis electron holography was used to acquire a tomographic tilt series of electron holograms, which were analysed to measure magnetic electron phase shift over two tilt arcs with up to $ \pm 60$ deg tilt range. Then, a 3D magnetisation vector field consistent with the tomographic phase measurements was reconstructed, revealing multiple magnetic domains within the nanowire. The reconstructed magnetisation is accurate for magnetic domains larger than 50 nm, and higher resolution can be achieved by the continued development of tomographic reconstruction algorithms.

# Unconventional gapping behavior in a kagome superconductor

## kagome超导体中的非常规间隙行为

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15333

arXiv:2411.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the types of superconducting order in quantum materials is a challenge, especially when multiple degrees of freedom, such as bands or orbitals, contribute to the fermiology and when superconductivity competes, intertwines, or coexists with other symmetry-breaking orders. Here, we study the Kagome-lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5, in which multiband superconductivity coexists with a charge order that substantially reduces the compound's space group symmetries. Through a combination of thermodynamic as well as electrical and thermal transport measurements, we uncover two superconducting regimes with distinct transport and thermodynamic characteristics, while finding no evidence for a phase transition separating them. Thermodynamic measurements reveal substantial quasiparticle weight in a high-temperature regime. At lower temperatures, this weight is removed via the formation of a second gap. The two regimes are sharply distinguished by a pronounced enhancement of the upper critical field at low temperatures and by a switch in the anisotropy of the longitudinal thermal conductivity as a function of in-plane magnetic field orientation. We argue that the band with a gap opening at lower temperatures continues to host low-energy quasiparticles, possibly due to a nodal structure of the gap. Taken together, our results present evidence for band-selective superconductivity with remarkable decoupling of the (two) superconducting gaps. The commonly employed multiband scenario, whereby superconductivity emerges in a primary band and is then induced in other bands appears to fail in this unconventional kagome superconductor. Instead, band-selective superconducting pairing is a paradigm that seems to unify seemingly contradicting results in this intensely studied family of materials and beyond.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic ground state of single crystals of the ruthenium-dimer-based hexagonal perovskite Ba$_{3}$ZnRu$_{2}$O$_{9}$ using magnetic susceptibility and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements. While a previous study on powder samples exhibited intriguing magnetic behavior, questions about whether the spin state within a Ru$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimer is a conventional $S = 3/2$ dimer or an orbital-selective $S = 1$ dimer were raised. The RIXS spectra reveal magnetic excitations from Hund's intraionic multiplet and intradimer spin-triplet transitions. The observed transition energies of the Hund's intraionic multiplets align with the $S=3/2$ ground state, contrasting with the theoretically proposed orbital-selective $S=1$ dimer state. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility analysis confirms the realization of the spin $S=3/2$ dimer state, and the extracted intradimer coupling is consistent with the spin-triplet transition energy observed in the RIXS spectra. These results highlights the ability of "spectroscopic fingerprinting" by RIXS to determine the magnetic ground states of complex materials.

Abstract: Complex ferromagnetic oxides such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) offer a pathway for creating energy efficient spintronic devices with new functionalities. LSMO exhibits high-temperature ferromagnetism, half metallicity, sharp resonance linewidth, low damping and a large anisotropic magnetoresistance response. Combined with Pt, a proven material with high spin-charge conversion efficiency, LSMO can potentially be used to create robust nano-oscillators. Here, we employed the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and spin-pumping FMR measurements to investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin transport in NdGaO3(110)/LSMO(15 nm)/Pt(0 and 5 nm) thin films at temperatures ranging from 300K to 90K. We find that the bilayer system exhibits a low magnetic damping (0.002), small linewidth (12Oe) and a large spin Hall angle ( 3.2%) at 170K, making it the optimum working temperature for spin orbit torque oscillators based on this system.

# Possibility of BCS-BEC crossover in $\kappa$-type organic superconductors

arXiv:2411.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of BCS-BEC crossover in superconductors, which smoothly connects Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory with Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in fermion systems, is an intriguing recent topic in strongly correlated electron systems. The organic superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$ ($\kappa$-HgBr) under pressure is one of the leading candidates, owing to its unique metallic spin-liquid nature and tunable electron correlation. We theoretically investigate the extended Hubbard model for $\kappa$-HgBr and discuss the possibility of the BCS-BEC crossover by systematically calculating superconducting correlation function, coherence length, superfluid weight, and chemical potential. Our findings show that the BCS-BEC crossover can be observed when competing phases, such as Mott insulators and charge and/or spin orders, are suppressed by appropriate hole doping. $\kappa$-HgBr is just the case because both the Mott insulating phase and magnetic orders are absent due to its nonstoichiometric Hg composition and geometrical frustration. We further propose that other $\kappa$-type organic superconductors could serve as potential candidates of the BCS-BEC crossover if their band fillings are systematically tuned.

# Itinerant electron metamagnetism for lattices with van Hove density-of-states singularities near the Fermi level

arXiv:2411.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Itinerant-electron metamagnetism is investigated within the Hubbard model for various lattices having van Hove singularities (vHS) in the electronic spectrum: face-centered cubic and orthorhombic lattices. The remarkable itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition occurs provided that the Fermi level is in the region with a strong positive curvature of the density of electron states typically positioned between two close van Hove singularities. Orthorhombic distortion of tetragonal lattice is a promising mechanism for generating two closely split vHS with strong density-of-states curvature between them. A phase diagram in terms of electron filling and Hubbard interaction parameter is presented, which shows the paramagnetic-metamagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition and regions of saturated and non-saturated magnetism. The standard Landau theory expansion based on electron density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level is demonstrated to be insufficient to describe the whole magnetic phase diagram including the itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition.

Abstract: As a special material symmetry operation, crystal twins usually influence physical properties. Here, detailed electrical transport and magnetic measurements were performed to reveal twinning effect on properties of van der Waals ferromagnet FePd$_2$Te$_2$. Orthorhombic crystal domains were observed in polarized optical microscopy and fixed $\pi$/2 angle between adjacent domains suggests a phase transition origin of the twins. FePd$_2$Te$_2$ exhibits fourfold in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance. It is attributed to antiferromagnetic coupling component near atomically flat twin boundary and pseudo four-fold symmetry from perpendicular Fe chains. Intense magnetic domain motion is suggested by Hopkinson effect observed in magnetic susceptibility. A set of unusual critical exponents $\beta$ = 0.866, $\gamma$ = 1.043, $\delta$ = 2.20 cannot be classified in any universal class predicted by renormalized group. Deviation from standard model reflects the non-saturating magnetization and slow growth of spontaneous magnetization resulting from crystal domain walls. These results show that additional symmetry from twins and twin boundary have a significant effect on electrical transport and magnetic properties of FePd$_2$Te$_2$. There is much room to modulate physical properties of twinned van der Waals ferromagnets through twins.

# Evidence of the inverse proximity effect in tunnel magnetic Josephson Junctions

arXiv:2411.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Josephson Junctions (MJJs) are a special class of hybrid systems where antagonistic correlations coexist, thus providing a key for advances in weak superconductivity, superconducting spintronics and quantum computation. So far, the memory properties of MJJs have been mostly investigated in view of digital electronics and for spintronic devices at liquid-helium temperature. At the operating temperature of quantum circuits, a magnetic order can rise in a Superconductor (S) at the S/Ferromagnet (F) interface, i.e., the inverse proximity effect (IPE), thus leading to a significant modification of the magnetic field patterns in MJJs. In this work, we have carried out a comparative investigation of the magnetic behavior of tunnel MJJs with a strong ferromagnetic layer inserted in the layout of both Nb and Al JJs, respectively. The comparative analysis validates the crucial role of the temperature, the fundamental scaling energies of S/F coupling systems, and the transparency of the S/F interface. This investigation points out that the IPE is a key aspect to consider when designing tunnel MJJs operating well below 4 K and thus in the perspective of hybrid superconducting quantum architectures.

Abstract: The possibility of magnetization resonant control in a Josephson superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor $\varphi_{0}$ junction shunted by an $LC$ circuit is demonstrated. As a result of the resonance of Josephson oscillations with oscillations in the circuit, a time-independent superconducting current arises in the junction. Due to the coupling of the Josephson phase and the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer, the resulting superconducting current leads to a deviation of the easy axis from its initial position and to a precession of the magnetization around the tilted axis. We show that the tilt value increases with the increasing spin-orbit interaction and the Josephson to magnetic energy ratio. An analytical expression for the magnetization tilt is obtained, which agrees well with the results of numerical calculations. The emerging possibility of resonant control of magnetization in a shunted $\varphi_{0}$ junction can be used in the development of novel technologies in the field of superconducting electronics and spintronics.

Abstract: Antiferroelectrics, which host both polar and antipolar order parameters, are characterized by the double hysteresis loops which are advantageous for various applications such as high-density energy storage. In this study, we investigate the coupling between oxygen octahedral rotations and polarization in well-known perovskites, with a focus on SrTiO$_3$. Using first-principles calculations and symmetry-adapted Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, we construct an energy landscape to analyze how this coupling shapes polarization-voltage hysteresis behavior. We show that tuning the relative strength of polar and rotational instabilities by exploiting epitaxial strain and layering leads to nontrivial hysteresis behavior. Consequently, the rotation coupling with polarization leads to an expanded search space of materials exhibiting antiferroelectric-like double hysteresis.

# Electronic Trap Detection with Carrier-Resolved Photo-Hall Effect

## 具有载流子分辨光霍尔效应的电子陷阱检测

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16092

arXiv:2411.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic trap states are a critical yet unavoidable aspect of semiconductor devices, impacting performance of various electronic devices such as transistors, memory devices, solar cells, and LEDs. The density, energy level, and position of these trap states often enable or constrain device functionality, making their measurement crucial in materials science and device fabrication. Most methods for measuring trap states involve fabricating a junction, which can inadvertently introduce or alter traps, highlighting the need for alternative, less-invasive techniques. Here, we present a unique photo-Hall-based method to detect and characterize trap density and energy level while concurrently extracting key carrier properties, including mobility, photocarrier density, recombination lifetime, and diffusion length. This technique relies on analyzing the photo-Hall data in terms of "photo-Hall conductivity" vs. electrical conductivity under varying light intensities and temperatures. We show that the photo-Hall effect, in the presence of traps, follows an $\textit{astonishingly simple}$ relationship - $\textit{a hyperbola equation}$ - that reveals detailed insights into charge transport and trap occupation. We have successfully applied this technique to P and N-type silicon as a benchmark and to high-performance halide perovskite photovoltaic films. This technique substantially expands the capability of Hall effect-based measurements by integrating the effects of the four most common excitations in nature - electric field, magnetic field, photon, and phonon in solids - into a single equation and enabling unparalleled extraction of charge carrier and trap properties in semiconductors.

# Control of ferromagnetism of Vanadium Oxide thin films by oxidation states

## 通过氧化态控制氧化钒薄膜的铁磁性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16125

arXiv:2411.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium oxide (VOx) is a material of significant interest due to its metal-insulator transition (MIT) properties as well as its diverse stable antiferromagnetism depending on the valence states of V and O with distinct MIT transitions and N\'eel temperatures. Although several studies reported the ferromagnetism in the VOx, it was mostly associated with impurities or defects, and pure VOx has rarely been reported as ferromagnetic. Our research presents clear evidence of ferromagnetism in the VOx thin films, exhibiting a saturation magnetization of approximately 14 kA/m at 300 K. We fabricated 20-nm thick VOx thin films via reactive sputtering from a metallic vanadium target in various oxygen atmosphere. The oxidation states of ferromagnetic VOx films show an ill-defined stoichiometry of V2O3+p, where p = 0.05, 0.23, 0.49, with predominantly disordered microstructures. Ferromagnetic nature of these VOx films is confirmed through a strong antiferromagnetic exchange coupling with the neighboring ferromagnetic layer in the VOx/Co bilayers, in which the spin configurations of Co layer is influenced strongly due to the additional anisotropy introduced by VOx layer. The present study highlights the potential of VOx as an emerging functional magnetic material with tunability by oxidation states for modern spintronic applications.

Abstract: Recently, time-reversal symmetry broken magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have attracted extensive attention and have provided an intriguing platform for exploring fundamental physical phenomena. The study of chromium telluride-based systems has also drawn significant interest towards spintronics applications owing to their high Curie temperatures. Here, using \textit{ab initio} calculations, we propose the emergence of multiple Weyl points (WPs) near the Fermi level in such an intrinsic ferromagnetic system, Cr$_3$Te$_4$. The large, well-separated, nontrivial Fermi arcs and surface states, suggest that the WPs are highly robust and resilient to perturbations. A substantial Berry curvature contribution in the vicinity of the Fermi energy not only serves as the origin of large conventional anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), but also produces unconventional parallel AHC in this material, owing to the low structural symmetry. In addition to the charge Hall conductivity, we also find significant anomalous Nernst conductivities originating from the Berry curvature. Alongside our theoretical predictions, we present complementary experimental results, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and an examination of the magnetic properties, which demonstrate a Curie temperature of 327 K. Our study advances the understanding of magnetic WSMs, and also encourages further studies in the context of topological properties of our proposed material.

# Typical altermagnetism with huge nonrelativistic spin-split and flat band in the bulk CoF$_2$

## 具有巨大非相对论自旋分裂和平带的典型地磁

arXiv:2411.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a third phase named altermagnet, has been introduced to describe a special magnetic state and some materials are classified as altermagnets. Here, our first principles calculations indicate that the bulk CoF$_2$ is an altermagnet with a huge spin-split and flat bands near the Fermi energy. By comparing the results with and without spin-orbit coupling, it can be shown that the huge spin splitting is not caused by relativistic effects but rather by a special symmetry. There are also flat bands near the Fermi energy which can be adjusted by changing the direction of the magnetic moment. From the band structure, we obtain a spin-resolved effective low-energy model that describes a quasi-two-dimensional hole gas with two independent spin components, leading to exotic transport phenomena that are distinct from those in conventional two-dimensional or bulk materials. Therefore, the bulk CoF$_2$ is a typical altermagnet with a huge nonrelativistic spin-split and flat bands which deserves further study for the potential spintronics and electronics applications.

arXiv:2411.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of (co)irreducible representations of energy bands at high-symmetry points (HSPs) is essential for high-throughput research on topological materials based on symmetry-indicators or topological quantum chemistry. However, existing computational packages usually require transforming crystal structures into specific conventions, thus hindering extensive application, especially to materials whose symmetries are yet to be identified. To address this issue, we developed a Mathematica package, \texttt{ToMSGKpoint}, capable of determining the little groups and (co)irreducible representations of little groups of HSPs, high-symmetry lines (HSLs), and high-symmetry planes (HSPLs) for any nonmagnetic and magnetic crystalline materials in two and three dimensions, with or without considering spin-orbit coupling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first package to achieve such functionality. The package also provides magnetic space group operations, supports the analysis of (co)irreducible representations of energy bands at HSPs, HSLs, and HSPLs using electronic wavefunctions obtained from \textit{ab initio} calculations interfaced with VASP. Designed for user convenience, the package generates results in a few simple steps and presents all relevant information in clear tabular format. Its versatility is demonstrated through applications to nonmagnetic topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi, as well as the antiferromagnetic topological material MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Suitable for any crystal structure, this package can be conveniently applied in a streamlined study once magnetic space group varies with various symmetry-breakings caused by phase transitions.

# Charge-induced energy shift of a single-spin qubit under a magnetic-field gradient

## 磁场梯度下单自旋量子位的电荷诱导能量位移

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16224

arXiv:2411.16224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electron confined by a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) can be displaced by changes in electron occupations of surrounding QDs owing to the Coulomb interaction. For a single-spin qubit in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, such a displacement of the host electron results in a qubit energy shift which must be handled carefully for high-fidelity operations. Here we spectroscopically investigate the qubit energy shift induced by changes in charge occupations of nearby QDs for a silicon single-spin qubit in a magnetic-field gradient. Between two different charge configurations of an adjacent double QD, a spin qubit shows an energy shift of about 4 MHz, which necessitates strict management of electron positions over a QD array. We confirm a correlation between the qubit frequency and the charge configuration by using a postselection analysis.

# Temperature Control of Spin-Wave Spectra in Continuously Graded Epitaxial Pd-Fe Alloy Films

## 连续梯度外延pd-fe合金薄膜中自旋波谱的温度控制

arXiv:2411.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuously graded ferromagnetic thin films represent a new class of magnonic materials, where a spin-wave resonance spectrum can be tuned in resonance frequencies/fields, number of modes and even dispersion law by the magnetic properties profiling across the film thickness. In the paper, we demonstrate that temperature is another degree of freedom controlling the spin-wave spectra in graded magnetic materials. We show that temperature affects the spectrum not only in a trivial way via the temperature dependence of magnetization and related quantities, but rather through modification of magnetic structure of a film due to the Curie temperature being crossed by fractions of its thickness. The profile that is continuous at lower temperatures may become discontinuous at higher temperatures. To demonstrate this, four 200-nm thick vertically graded epitaxial Pd1-xFex films were synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy technique, in particular, two with the linear (2-10 at.% and 12-18 at.% range of the iron content), one with the sine and one with the cosine (both with the 2-10 at.% range of the iron content) distribution profiles. The resonance spectra of standing spin waves were studied by the cavity ferromagnetic resonance at 9.4 GHz in the temperature range of 20-300 K. Versatile spin-wave excitation patterns were obtained, and drastic evolution of their excitation energies, and number of modes with temperature was observed. Based on the modeling, temperature dependences of the spin-wave stiffness D and magnitudes of the interface $\alpha_{inter}$ and surface $\alpha_{surf}$ pinning constants were obtained. Our study shows that in addition to a continuous grading of magnetic properties of thin films, temperature provides another powerful and well elaborated tool for modifying the magnetic grading profile and thus, flexile tuning the spectrum of spin-wave excitations.

arXiv:2411.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that Terahertz sensors can effectively detect the spin resonances of Dirac fermions in graphene. The associated photovoltaic measurement technique allows for the investigation of the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in graphene as well as its topological properties from microwave to Terahertz frequencies. In this work, using graphene/MoS2-based Field-Effect Transistors, we observed a magnetic resonance photovoltage signal in the Gigahertz range that is independent of the gate bias. The dispersion of the associated spin-flip transitions remains intriguingly unaffected by the MoS2 layer. In parallel, the spin-related signal consistently appears as a drop in photovoltage, regardless of the signal's polarity or origin, whether it arises from plasma wave rectification or thermoelectric effects. This behavior is interpreted as a decrease in the system's spin polarization due to spin-dependent recombination or scattering of photocarriers. Understanding the various photovoltaic signals in highly sensitive Gigahertz/Terahertz sensors paves the way for exploring spin-dependent mechanisms in two-dimensional quantum materials, influenced by proximity effects such as spin-orbit coupling, topology, and magnetism.

# Origin of the transitions inversion in rare-earth vanadates

## 稀土钒酸盐转变反转的起源

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16351

arXiv:2411.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surprising inversion of the orbital- and magnetic-order transition temperatures in the RVO3 series with increasing the rare-earth radius makes the series unique among orbitally-ordered materials. Here, augmenting dynamical mean-field theory with a decomposition of the order parameter into irreducible tensors, we show that this anomalous behavior emerges from an unusual hierarchy of interactions. First, increasing the rare-earth radius, orbital physics comes to be controlled by xz-xz quadrupolar super-exchange rather than by lattice distortion. Next, for antiferromagnetic spin order, orbital super-exchange terms with different spin rank compete, so that the dipolar spin-spin interaction dominates. Eventually, G-type magnetic order (anti-ferro in all directions) can appear already above the orbital ordering transition, and C-type order (anti-ferro in the ab plane) right around it. The strict constraints we found explain why the inversion is rare, giving at the same time criteria to look for similar behavior in other materials.

# Bosonic Peierls state emerging from the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo interaction

arXiv:2411.16357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important effect induced by the particle-lattice interaction, the Peierls transition, a hot topic in condensed matter physics, is usually believed to occur in the one-dimensional fermionic systems. We here study a bosonic version of the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo lattice model, which describes itinerant bosons interact with the localized magnetic moments via only longitudinal Kondo exchange.\ We show that, by means of perturbation analysis and numerical density-matrix renormalization group method, a bosonic analog of the Peierls state can occur in proper parameters regimes. The Peierls state here is characterized by the formation of a long-range spin-density-wave order, the periodicity of which is set by the density of the itinerant bosons. The ground-state phase diagram is mapped out by extrapolating the finite-size results to thermodynamic limit. Apart from the bosonic Peierls state, we also reveal the presence of some other magnetic orders, including a paramagnetic phase and a ferromagnetic phase. We finally propose a possible experimental scheme with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Our results broaden the frontiers of the current understanding of the one-dimensional particle-lattice interaction system.

# Highly Efficient Non-relativistic Edelstein effect in p-wave magnets

## p波磁体中的高效非相对论Edelstein效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16378

arXiv:2411.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion, known as the Edelstein effect (EE), has been typically linked to spin-orbit coupling mechanisms, which require materials with heavy elements within a non-centrosymmetric environment. Here we demonstrate that the high efficiency of spin-charge conversion can be achieved even without spin-orbit coupling in the recently identified coplanar p-wave magnets. The non-relativistic Edelstein effect (NREE) in these magnets exhibits a distinct phenomenology compared to the relativistic EE, characterized by a strongly anisotropic response and an out-of-plane polarized spin density resulting from the spin symmetries. We illustrate the NREE through minimal tight-binding models, allowing a direct comparison to different systems. Through first-principles calculations, we further identify the p-wave candidate material CeNiAsO as a high-efficiency NREE material, revealing a 25 times larger response than the maximally achieved relativistic EE and other reported NREE in non-collinear magnetic systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. This highlights the potential for efficient spin-charge conversion in p-wave magnetic systems.

Abstract: Skyrmions are stable topological textures that have garnered substantial attention within the ferroelectric community for their exotic functional properties. While previous studies have questioned the feasibility of [001]$_{\text{pc}}$ skyrmion tubes in rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ due to the high energy cost of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, we demonstrate here their stabilization with topological charges of $\mathcal{Q} = \pm 1$ from density functional theory and second-principles calculations. By enabling extensive vortex and antivortex polarization configurations, we overcome the expected prohibitive energetic barriers while preserving the topological nature of the structures. Notably, we extend these findings to demonstrate the appearance of skyrmion and antiskyrmion tubes in other related materials, highlighting their broader relevance. Furthermore, our computational experiments indicate that these structures can be directly stabilized and reversibly switched by applied electric fields, establishing a straightforward route for their practical realization and functional control in nanoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy at low temperatures and high magnetic fields has been performed on a noncentrosymmetric La$_3$Se$_4$ superconductor with a critical temperature $T_c$ = 8 K. Two superconducting energy gaps $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ with $2\Delta_{1}/k_{B} T_{c}$ ~ 5.8 and $2\Delta_{2}/k_{B} T_{c}$ ~ 2.3, are directly observed in some of the spectra. The temperature and magnetic field effects help to resolve a two-gap structure even on the most frequent spectra where at low temperatures only a single gap is apparent, reflected in a pair of maxima around the zero bias. Two-gap superconductivity consistently with the point contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy is also supported by the heat capacity and the Hall probe magnetization measurements.

arXiv:2411.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) layered ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 shows great potential in two-dimensional spintronic application due to its robust room-temperature ferromagnetism and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Despite the tremendous progress in the spintronic and electronic studies of Fe3GaTe2, much less effort has been spent on the understanding of lattice dynamics and its possible interaction with spintronic and electronic degrees of freedom in Fe3GaTe2. In this work, by combining Raman spectroscopic data in a wide range of pressure (atmospheric pressure~19.5 GPa) and temperature (80 K~690 K) with first-principles calculation results, we systematically studied the lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of Fe3GaTe2. Our results show that the phonon energies of Fe3GaTe2 located at 126.0 cm-1 and 143.5 cm-1 originate from the E_2g^2 and A_1g^1 vibration modes, respectively, and the nature of the E_2g^2 mode is anharmonic while that of the A_1g^1 mode is quasi-harmonic. Furthermore, the spin-phonon coupling in Fe3GaTe2 is discovered by identifying the anomalies in the Raman data right below the Curie temperature of 360 K, in which the phonon energies and the full widths at half maximum of the E_2g^2 mode clearly deviate from the classical anharmonic model. Our findings are valuable for fundamental studies and potential applications of vdW Fe3GaTe2-based materials and devices under variable temperature and pressure conditions.

arXiv:2411.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mott insulator Ca2RuO4 is a paradigmatic example among transition metal oxides, where the interplay of charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom leads to competing quantum phases. In this paper, we focus on and review some key aspects, from the underlying physical framework and its basic properties, to recent theoretical efforts that aim to trigger unconventional quantum ground states, using several external parameters and stimuli. Using first-principle calculations, we demonstrate that Ca2RuO4 shows a spin splitting in the reciprocal space, and identify it as an altermagnetic candidate material. The non relativistic spin-splitting has an orbital selective nature, dictated by the local crystallographic symmetry. Next, we consider two routes that may trigger exotic quantum states. The first one corresponds to transition metal substitution of the 4d4 Ru with isovalent 3d3 ions. This substitutional doping may alter the spin-orbital correlations favoring the emergence of negative thermal expansion. The second route explores fledgling states arising in a nonequilibrium steady state under the influence of an applied electric field. We show that the electric field can directly affect the orbital density, eventually leading to strong orbital fluctuations and the suppression of orbital imbalance, which may, in turn, reduce antiferromagnetism. These aspects suggest possible practical applications, as its unique properties may open up possibilities for augmenting existing technologies, surpassing the limitations of conventional materials.

Abstract: In this paper we showcase the strengths of polarized neutron imaging as a magnetic imaging technique through a case study on field-cooled multifilamentary YBCO tape carrying a transport current while containing a trapped magnetic field. The measurements were done at J-PARC's RADEN beamline, measuring a radiograph of a single polarization component, to showcase the analysis potential with minimal acquisition time.
  Regions of internal damage are easily and accurately identified as the technique probes the internal magnetic field of the sample, thereby avoiding surface-smearing effects. Quantitative measurements of the integrated field strength in various regions are acquired using time-of-flight information. Finally, we estimate the strength of the screening currents in the superconductor during the experiment by simulating an experiment with a model sample and comparing it to the experimental data. With this, we show that polarized neutron imaging is not only a useful tool for investigating magnetic structures but also for investigating samples carrying currents.

arXiv:2411.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square ice is a two-dimensional spin liquid hosting a Coulomb phase physics. When constrained under specific boundary conditions, the so-called domain-wall boundary conditions, a phase separation occurs that leads to the formation of a spin liquid confined within a disk surrounded by magnetically ordered regions. Here, we numerically characterize the ground-state properties of this spin liquid, coined the arctic square ice in reference to a phenomenon known in statistical mechanics. Our results reveal that both the vertex distributions and the magnetic correlations are inhomogeneous within the liquid region, and they exhibit a radial dependence. If these properties resemble those of the conventional square ice close to the center of the disk, they evolve continuously as the disk perimeter is approached. There, the spin liquid orders. As a result, pinch points, signaling the presence of algebraic spin correlations, coexist with magnetic Bragg peaks in the magnetic structure factor computed within the disk. The arctic square ice thus appears as an unconventional Coulomb phase sharing common features with a fragmented spin liquid, albeit on a charge-neutral vacuum.

arXiv:2411.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography serves as a key tool for identifying quantum states generated in quantum computers and simulators, typically involving local operations on individual particles or qubits to enable measurements in various bases. However, this approach requires an exponentially larger number of measurement setups as quantum platforms grow in size, highlighting the necessity of more scalable methods to efficiently perform quantum state estimation. Here, we present a tomography scheme that scales far more efficiently and, remarkably, eliminates the need for local addressing of single constituents before measurements. Inspired by the "spin-spiral" structure in magnetic materials, our scheme combines a series of measurement setups, each with different spiraling patterns, with compressed sensing techniques. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of tomographic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we show how this method is suitable for the measurement of specific entanglement properties of interesting quantum many-body states, such as entanglement entropy, in various realistic experimental conditions. This method offers a positive outlook across a wide range of quantum platforms, including those in which precise individual operations are challenging, such as optical lattice systems.

arXiv:2411.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities (vHs) located close to the Fermi level in Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) have profound influence on their electronic and transport characteristics. Specifically, magneto-transport and susceptibility measurements on CsV3Sb5 reveal an anomalous temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_c2 (T), characterized by a pronounced upward curvature for both in-plane and c-axis magnetic fields, with zero-temperature H_c2 values of ~6.0 T and ~1.2 T, respectively. Our theoretical analysis, using a newly developed single-band model incorporating vHs and gap anisotropy, suggests that the observed upper critical field behavior is predominantly driven by the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity originating from vHs, instead of multi-band effects or gap anisotropy. Increased electron scattering introduced by proton irradiation defects smears out the vHs, reduces anisotropy, and recovers the conventional H_c2 (T) behavior, corroborating our proposed model.

Abstract: Ferroelectric (FE)-based devices show great promise for non-volatile memory applications, yet few demonstrate reliable operation at elevated temperatures. In this work, we fabricated and characterized metal ferroelectric semiconductor capacitors integrating Aluminum Scandium Nitride onto Silicon Carbide, a prospective high temperature semiconductor for logic operations in extreme environments. The resultant Ni/Al0.68Sc0.32N/4H-SiC structure was evaluated for non-volatile memory performance from room temperature to high-temperature conditions. The 30-nm thick Al0.68Sc0.32N/SiC-based ferroelectric capacitors demonstrated ferroelectric switching at 900 C. The coercive field of the FE layer decreased linearly from -6.4/+11.9 MV cm-1 at room temperature to -3.1/+7.8 MV cm-1 at 800 C. Using positive-up negative-down measurements, we characterized the temperature dependence of remanent polarization. At 600 C, the devices achieved remarkable reliability, demonstrating endurance of ~2000 cycles and retention exceeding 100 hours with negligible polarization loss. Further reliability measurements extended to 800 C with 10,000 secs retention and > 300 endurance cycles, establish these devices as promising candidates for high-temperature memory applications.

# Emergence of the 3D diluted Ising model universality class in a mixture of two magnets

arXiv:2411.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usually, the impact of structural disorder on the magnetic phase transition in the 3D Ising model is analyzed within the framework of quenched dilution by a non-magnetic component, where some lattice sites are occupied by Ising spins, while others are non-magnetic. This kind of quenched dilution, according to the Harris criterion, leads to a change in the critical exponents that govern the asymptotics in the vicinity of the phase transition point. However, the inherent reason for the emergence of a new, random Ising model universality class is not the presence of a non-magnetic component but the disorder in structure of spin arrangement. To demonstrate this fact, in this paper, we set up extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a random mixture of two Ising-like magnets that differ in spin length $s$ and concentration $c$. In doing so, we analyze the effect of structural disorder \textit{per se} without appealing to the presence of a non-magnetic component. We support our numerical simulations with renormalization group calculations. Our results demonstrate the emergence of the 3D randomly diluted Ising model universality class in a random mixture of two Ising magnets. While the asymptotic critical exponents coincide with those known for the site-diluted 3D Ising model, the effective critical behavior is triggered by parameters $s$ and $c$. The impact of their interplay is a subject of detailed analysis.

# Fully nonequilibrium Hall response from Berry curvature

## 来自Berry曲率的完全非平衡霍尔响应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16675

arXiv:2411.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological materials, Berry curvature leads to intrinsic Hall responses. Focusing on time-reversal symmetric systems with broken inversion symmetry, a spontaneoous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect is expected to develop under an applied electric field. Motivated by recent developments in Weyl-Kondo semimetals, here we advance a fully nonequilibrium (FNE) Hall response due to the Berry curvature. In particular, we show that, while the spontaneous Hall current is quadratic in the previously described regime of weak electric field, due to the contribution from the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, the FNE Hall response for non-perturbative electric fields is not controlled by the Berry curvature dipole. Remarkably, the FNE Hall response resembles what happens in systems that break the microscopic time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate the universality of these results by comparing them with their counterparts in systems with any higher-multipole of the Berry curvature. The implications of our results for the understanding of strongly correlated topological semimetals are discussed.

Abstract: There are several methods to improve cancer patient survival rates by inducing hyperthermia in tumor tissues, which involves raising their temperature above 41{\deg}C. These methods utilize different energy sources to deliver heat to the target region, including light, microwaves or radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. We have developed a new, magnetically responsive nanocarrier, consisting of liposomes loaded with magnetic nanoparticles and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP), commonly known as Cisplatin. The resulting magnetoliposome (ML) is rapidly internalized by lung and pancreas tumor cell lines, stored in intracellular vesicles, and capable of inducing hyperthermia under magnetic fields. The ML has no significant toxicity both in vitro and in vivo and, most importantly, enhances cell death by apoptosis after magnetic hyperthermia. Remarkably, mice bearing induced lung tumors, treated with CDDP-loaded nanocarriers and subjected to an applied electromagnetic field, showed an improved survival rate over those treated with either soluble CDDP or hyperthermia alone. Therefore, our approach of magnetic hyperthermia plus CDDP-ML significantly enhances in vitro cell death and in vivo survival of treated animals.

arXiv:2411.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exotic forms of wave control have been emerging by engineering matter in space and time. In this framework, temporal photonic interfaces, i.e., abrupt changes in the electromagnetic properties of a material, have been shown to induce temporal scattering phenomena dual to spatial reflection and refraction, at the basis of photonic time crystals and space-time metamaterials. Despite decades-old theoretical studies on these topics, and recent experimental demonstrations, the careful modeling of these phenomena has been lagging behind. Here, we develop from first principles a rigorous model of the electrodynamics of temporal photonic interfaces, highlighting the crucial role of the mechanisms driving time variations. We demonstrate that the boundary conditions and conservation laws associated with temporal scattering may substantially deviate from those commonly employed in the literature, based on their microscopic implementation. Our results open new vistas for both fundamental investigations over light-matter interactions in time-varying structures and for the prospect of their future implementations and applications in optics and photonics.

Abstract: Topological characteristics of quantum systems are typically determined by the closing of a gap, while the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) during quantum real-time evolution has emerged as a nonequilibrium analog to the quantum phase transition (QPT). In this paper, we illustrate that the system dynamics can be elucidated by considering the precession of a collection of free-pseudo spins under a magnetic field based on the exact results of extended Kitaev chains. The topology of the driven Hamiltonian is determined by the average winding number of the nonequilibrium state. Furthermore, we establish that the singularity of the DQPT arises from two perpendicular pseudo-spin vectors associated with the pre- and post-quenched Hamiltonians. Moreover, we investigate the distinct behaviors of the dynamic pairing order parameter in both topological and non-topological regions. These findings offer valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of topological superconductors, contributing to the understanding of the resilience of topological properties in driven quantum systems.

# Realizing Altermagnetism in Fermi-Hubbard Models with Ultracold Atoms

Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a type of collinear magnetism, that is in some aspects distinct from ferromagnetism and from conventional antiferromagnetism. In contrast to the latter, sublattices of opposite spin are related by spatial rotations and not only by translations and inversions. As a result, altermagnets have spin-split bands leading to unique experimental signatures. Here, we show theoretically how a d-wave altermagnetic phase can be realized with ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices. We propose an altermagnetic Hubbard model with anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping and obtain the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. The altermagnetic phase separates in a metallic and an insulating phase and is robust over a large parameter regime. We show that one of the defining characteristics of altermagnetism, the anisotropic spin transport, can be probed with trap-expansion experiments.

Abstract: The atomic configuration of phases and their interfaces is fundamental to materials design and engineering. Here, we unveil a transition metal oxide interface, whose formation is driven by energetic influences - epitaxial tensile strain versus oxygen octahedra connectivity - that compete in determining the orientation of an orthorhombic perovskite film. We study this phenomenon in a system of LaVO$_3$ grown on (101) DyScO$_3$, using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy to measure intrinsic markers of orthorhombic symmetry. We identify that the film resolves this energetic conflict by switching its orientation by 90 degrees at an atomically-flat plane within its volume, not at the film/substrate interface. At either side of this "switching plane", characteristic orthorhombic distortions tend to zero to couple mismatched oxygen octahedra rotations. The resulting boundary is highly energetic, which makes it a priori unlikely; by using second-principles atomistic modeling, we show how its formation requires structural relaxation of an entire film grown beyond a critical thickness measuring tens of unit cells. The switching plane breaks the inversion symmetry of the Pnma orthorhombic structure, and sharply joins two regions, a thin intermediate layer and the film bulk, that are held under different mechanical strain states. By therefore contacting two distinct phases of one compound that would never otherwise coexist, this alternative type of interface opens new avenues for nanoscale engineering of functional systems, such as a chemically-uniform but magnetically inhomogeneous heterostructure.

Abstract: Topology, like symmetry, is a fundamental concept in understanding general properties of physical systems. In condensed matter, nontrivial topology may manifest itself as singular features in the energy spectrum or the quantization of electrical properties such as conductance and magnetic flux. Using microwave spectroscopy, we determine that a superconducting circuit with three Josephson tunnel junctions in parallel can possess degeneracies indicative of \emph{intrinsic} nontrivial topology. We identify three topological invariants, one of which is related to a hidden quantum mechanical supersymmetry. Measurements show that devices fabricated in different topological regimes fall on a simple phase diagram which should be robust to junction imperfections and geometric inductance. Josephson tunnel junction circuits, which are readily fabricated with conventional microlithography techniques, allow access to a wide range of topological systems that may have no condensed matter analog. Notable spectral features of these circuits, such as degeneracies and flat bands, may find use in quantum information, sensing, and metrology.

Abstract: Charge order pervades the phase diagrams of quantum materials where it competes with superconducting and magnetic phases, hosts electronic phase transitions and topological defects, and couples to the lattice generating intricate structural distortions. Incommensurate charge order is readily stabilized in manganese oxides where it is associated with anomalous electronic and magnetic properties, but its nanoscale structural inhomogeneity complicates precise characterization and understanding of its relationship with competing phases. Leveraging atomic-resolution variable temperature cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy, we characterize the thermal evolution of charge order as it transforms from its ground state in a model manganite system. We find that mobile networks of discommensurations and dislocations generate phase inhomogeneity and induce global incommensurability in an otherwise lattice-locked modulation. Driving the order to melt at high temperatures, the discommensuration density grows and regions of order locally decouple from the lattice periodicity.

# Topologically protected flatness in chiral moir\'e heterostructures

arXiv:2403.19656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of delicate correlated phases in twisted heterostructures of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides suggests that moir\'e flat bands are intrinsically resilient against certain types of disorder. Here, we investigate the robustness of moir\'e flat bands in the chiral limit of the Bistrizer-MacDonald model -- applicable to both platforms in certain limits -- and demonstrate drastic differences between the first magic angle and higher magic angles in response to chiral symmetric disorder that arise, for instance, from lattice relaxation. Using a hidden constant of motion, we decompose the non-abelian gauge field induced by interlayer tunnelings into two decoupled abelian ones, whose effective magnetic field splits into an anomalous contribution and a fluctuating part. The anomalous field maps the moir\'e flat bands onto a zeroth Dirac Landau level, whose flatness withstands any chiral symmetric perturbation due to a topological index theorem -- thereby underscoring a topological mechanism for band flatness. Only the first magic angle can fully harness this topological protection due to its weak fluctuating magnetic field. In higher magic angles, the amplitude of fluctuations largely exceeds the anomalous contribution, which we find results in an extremely large sensitivity to microscopic details. Through numerical simulations, we study various types of disorder and identify the processes that are enhanced or suppressed in the chiral limit. Interestingly, we find that the topological suppression of disorder broadening persists away from the chiral limit and is further accentuated by isolating a single sublattice polarized flat band in energy. Our analysis suggests the Berry curvature hotspot at the top of the $K$ and $K'$ valence band in the transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers is essential for the stability of its moir\'e flat bands and their correlated states.

Abstract: We revealed the anomalous temperature behavior of the giant dielectric permittivity and unusual frequency dependences of the pyroelectric response of the fine-grained ceramics prepared by the spark plasma sintering of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The temperature dependences of the electro-resistivity indicate the frequency-dependent transition in the electro-transport mechanisms between the lower and higher conductivity states accompanied by the maximum in the temperature dependence of the loss angle tangent. The pyroelectric thermal-wave probing revealed the existence of the spatially inhomogeneous counter-polarized ferroelectric state at the opposite surfaces of the ceramic sample. We described the temperature behavior of the giant dielectric response and losses using the core-shell model for ceramic grains, effective medium approach and Maxwell-Wagner approach. The superparaelectric-like state with a giant dielectric response may appear due to the internal barrier-layer capacitance effect, while the step-like thermal activation of localized polarons in the semiconducting grains is not excluded. The elucidation of the state microscopic origin requires measurements in the frequency range above 1 MHz.

In our models a combination of the N\'{e}el order and the charge-density wave order results in spin splitting of the conducting fermions. In addition, spin-orbit coupling is required to drive the anomalous Hall effect. In the first model we analyzed the effects of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, and of the intrinsic $d-$wave spin-orbit coupling in the second model.

Abstract: Hole spin qubits are rapidly emerging as the workhorse of semiconducting quantum processors because of their large spin-orbit interaction, enabling fast all-electric operations at low power. However, spin-orbit interaction also causes non-uniformities in devices, resulting in locally varying qubit energies and site-dependent anisotropies. While these anisotropies can be used to drive single-spins, if not properly harnessed, they can hinder the path toward large-scale quantum processors. Here, we report on microwave-driven singlet-triplet qubits in planar germanium and use them to investigate the anisotropy of two spins in a double quantum dot. We show two distinct operating regimes depending on the magnetic field direction. For in-plane fields, the two spins are largely anisotropic, and electrically tunable, which enables to measure all the available transitions; coherence times exceeding 3 $\mu$s are extracted. For out-of-plane fields, they have an isotropic response but preserve the substantial energy difference required to address the singlet-triplet qubit. Even in this field direction, where the qubit lifetime is strongly affected by nuclear spins, we find 400 ns coherence times. Our work adds a valuable tool to investigate and harness the anisotropy of spin qubits and can be implemented in any large-scale NxN device, facilitating the path towards scalable quantum processors.

Abstract: The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in condensed matter physics has drawn attention to kagome antiferromagnets (AFM) where a two-dimensional corner-sharing network of triangles frustrates conventional magnetic orders. While quantum kagome AFMs based on Cu$^{2+}$ (3d$^9$, $s=\frac{1}{2}$) ions have been extensively studied, there is so far little work beyond copper-based systems. Here we present our bulk magnetization, specific heat and neutron scattering studies on single crystals of a new titanium fluoride Cs$_8$RbK$_3$Ti$_{12}$F$_{48}$ where Ti$^{3+}$ (3d$^1$, $s = \frac{1}{2}$) ions form a modulated quantum kagome antiferromagnet that does not order magnetically down to 1.5 K. Our comprehensive map of the dynamic response function $S(Q,\hbar\omega)$ acquired at 1.5 K where the heat capacity is T-linear reveals a dispersive continuum emanating from soft lines that extend along (100). The data indicate fractionalized spinon-like excitations with quasi-one-dimensional dispersion within a quasi-two-dimensional spin system.

# High-Throughput Discovery of Kagome Materials in Transition Metal Oxide Monolayers

Abstract: Kagome materials are known for hosting exotic quantum states, including quantum spin liquids, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. The search for kagome monolayers is driven by their ability to exhibit neat and well-defined kagome bands near the Fermi level, which are more easily realized in the absence of interlayer interactions. However, this absence also destabilizes the monolayer forms of many bulk kagome materials, posing significant challenges to their discovery. In this work, we propose a strategy to address this challenge by utilizing oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides within a "1+3" design framework. Through high-throughput computational screening of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 thermodynamically stable kagome monolayers with diverse electronic and magnetic properties. These materials were classified into three categories based on their lattice geometry, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic configurations. Detailed analysis of three representative monolayers revealed kagome band features near their Fermi levels, with orbital contributions varying between oxygen 2p and transition metal d states. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy, offering a promising approach to uncovering low-dimensional kagome materials and advancing the exploration of their quantum phenomena.

Abstract: We investigate quantum phase transitions in a topological Josephson junction with an embedded ferromagnetic layer, revealing a rich landscape of critical phenomena. The low-energy excitations comprise Majorana fermions propagating along the junction, coupled to the magnons in the ferromagnet. Based on mean-field and renormalization group arguments, we predict Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions in this system, both in the case of a magnetic easy-plane and weak easy-axis anisotropy. In the latter case, this is based on an emergent effective easy-plane, spanned by the easy-axis and the component of the magnetization which couples to the Majoranas. We conclude by presenting a conjecture for the full phase diagram of the model. It covers BKT transitions as well as exotic multicritical and supersymmetric points known from related models of interacting real fermions and bosons.

Abstract: The impact of uniform lattice strain (with lattice parameter (LP), $a = 5.62$-$5.83$ \r{A}) and tetragonal lattice distortion (with $0.8 \leq c/a \leq1.2$ and $V_0$ volume; resulting LP: $a = 5.38$-$5.92$ \r{A}, $c = 5.33$-$6.45$ \r{A}) on the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of CoFeCrGa SGS alloy (optimized LP: $a = 5.72$ \r{A}) has been investigated. The SGS nature of CoFeCrGa remains robust under uniform strain; however, the tetragonal lattice distortion has a detrimental impact on the SGS nature, and even a small distortions lead to metallic nature for CoFeCrGa. Despite this, the tetragonally distorted structures maintain high spin polarization (SP $\geq 60\% $); except for the structure with $c/a = 0.8$, for which SP significantly decreases to $\sim 25\%$. The lattice deformation-induced magnetic anisotropy (MA) is also explored by considering the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) and the magnetic shape anisotropy (MSA). Both MCA and MSA eliminate for the Y-I ordered and uniformly strained structures, resulting in a magnetic isotropic nature for them. Conversely, the tetragonally distorted structures with $c/a < 1.0$ and $c/a > 1.0$ exhibit very high in-plane magnetic anisotropy and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, respectively; with magnitudes of $\sim 10^5$-$10^6$ J/m$^3$. For tetragonally deformed structures, MSA contribution to MA is negligible, and thus, MCA dictates the total MA. In summary, the isotropically strained structures show SGS nature, while the tetragonally distorted structures exhibit the high MA along with high SP.

Abstract: We study the ponderomotive potential of a bosonic Josephson junction periodically modulated by a high-frequency electromagnetic field. Within the small population difference approximation, the ponderomotive drive induces the well-known Kapitza pendulum effect, stabilizing a $\pi$-phase mode. We discuss the parameter dependence of the dynamical transition from macroscopic quantum self-trapping to $\pi$-Josephson oscillations. Furthermore, we examine the situation where the small population difference approximation fails. In this case, an essential momentum-shortening effect emerges, leading to a stabilized $\pi/2$-phase mode under certain conditions. By mapping this to a classical pendulum scenario, we highlight the uniqueness and limitations of the $\pi/2$-phase mode in bosonic Josephson junctions.

Abstract: Exchange couplings are fundamental to our understanding of many physical phenomena in condensed matter physics and material science. Model systems provide a controlled environment to investigate such phenomena, effectively. In this study, we employ first-principle calculations based on density functional theory and Green's function (GF) method to explore the impact of chemical structure on the sign and magnitude of exchange coupling, systematically. By designing model systems with bcc-Fe bulk doped with nonmagnetic X= (H, B, C, N, O, and F) atoms, we examine the effects of different ligands on the behavior of Fe-Fe exchange coupling, and demonstrate that the chemical environment surrounding the metal atom significantly influences the Fe-Fe exchange coupling. Our results highlight the tunability of exchange coupling based on Fe-dopant bond length(s), where the nature of ligand atoms and their electron correlation play a crucial role. This work illuminates the complex relationship between structure, and magnetism in magnetic materials, providing insights into the development of high-performance magnetic materials.

Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.

The magnetic-field dependence of the $p$-wave contacts agrees reasonably well with the virial expansion theory in a detuned magnetic field range, validating the theory near the Fermi temperature. The $p$-wave contacts measured in this study constitute a second dataset, complementing the data obtained from the $^{40}$K system and contributing valuable insights into $p$-wave interactions in ultracold Fermi gases.

Abstract: Sutherland considered the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic spin ring for all total spin sectors. He discovered that there is an instability at total spin $0$. The total spin 1 sector has a higher energy groundstate than the groundstate among spin singlets. He called this ``weak paramagnetism.''
  Some parts of Sutherland's analysis were obscure. There was a later reconsideration by Dhar and Shastry, who showed that Bloch wall states give a good approximation to the lowest energy eigenstates in each momentum sector. Unfortunately, their ansatz demonstrates no weak paramagnetism.
  The question resurfaced due to a conjecture called ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels,'' which Sutherland's weak paramagnetism falsifies. We show that Sutherland's finding is numerically validated for spin rings up to size $L=20$. We also show Dhar and Shastry's approximation is demonstrably inexact at total spin $0$, for theoretical reasons. We finally show that the single mode approximation together with a symmetry of the spin singlet can explain weak paramagnetism, heuristically.

Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems is a major problem in quantum matter. Specifically, efficiently solving the spectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator governing such dynamics remains a critical open challenge. Here, we put forward a method for solving the many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics based on the non-Hermitian kernel polynomial method and tensor-network techniques. We demonstrate the faithfulness of our method by computing the dynamics of the dephasing quantum compass model with a gradient magnetic field and comparing it with exact results. In particular, we show that our method allows us to characterize the quantum Zeno crossover and the reduction of relaxation rate due to Stark localization in this model. We further demonstrate the ability of our method to go beyond exact results by exploring nearest-neighbor interaction effects on the Liouvillian dynamics, elucidating the interplay between Stark localization and many-body interactions. Our method provides an efficient solution to many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics, establishing a methodology to explore large open quantum many-body systems.

arXiv:2409.11944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasispecies concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called "Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the "Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalize this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to variations in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution as the order parameter.

Abstract: The development of spintronic emitters of broadband THz pulses relies on designing heterostructures where processes of laser-driven spin current generation and subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion are the most efficient. An interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the emitter is one of the critical elements. Here, we study experimentally single-cycle THz pulse generation from a laser-pulse excited Pt/Co emitter with a composition gradient interface between Pt and Co and compare it with the emission from a conventional Pt/Co structure with an abrupt interface. We find that the gradient interface enhances the efficiency of optics-to-THz conversion by a factor of two in a wide range of optical fluences up to 3 mJ cm$^{-2}$. We reveal that this enhancement is caused by a pronounced increase in transmittance of the laser-driven spin-polarized current through the gradient interface compared to the abrupt one. Furthermore, we find that such a transmission deteriorates with laser fluence due to the spin accumulation effect.

Abstract: The heat engine of magnetic black holes in Einstein-AdS gravity coupled to rational nonlinear electrodynamics, as the working substance, is studied. The dynamical negative cosmological constant is considered as a thermodynamic pressure. We investigate the efficiency of black hole heat engines in extended space thermodynamics for rectangle closed path in the $P - V$ plane and the maximally efficient Carnot cycles. The exact efficiency formula which is written in terms of the mass of the black hole is obtained. It was demonstrated that the black hole efficiency decreases when the nonlinear electrodynamics coupling increases and the black hole efficiency increases if the magnetic charge increases. The relation between the efficiency, event horizon radiuses (entropy) and pressure is obtained. We study an efficiency of the holographic heat engine of a cycle in the vicinity of a critical point. Thus, the heat engine of our model can produce work.

Abstract: Silicon Carbide (SiC) is renowned for its exceptional thermal stability, making it a crucial material for high-temperature power devices in extreme environments. While optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) in SiC has been widely studied for magnetometry, it requires complex setups involving optical and microwave sources. Similarly, electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) in SiC, which relies on an electrical readout of spin resonance, has also been explored for magnetometry. However, both techniques require microwave excitation, which limits their scalability. In contrast, SiC's spin-dependent recombination (SDR) currents enable a purely electrical approach to magnetometry through the near zero-field magnetoresistance (NZFMR) effect, where the device resistance changes in response to small magnetic fields. Despite its potential, NZFMR remains underexplored for high-temperature applications. In this work, we demonstrate the use of NZFMR in SiC diodes for high-temperature magnetometry and achieve sensitive detection of weak magnetic fields at temperatures up to 500$^\circ$C . Our technology offers a simple and cost-effective alternative to other magnetometry architectures. The NZFMR signal is modulated by an external magnetic field, which alters the singlet-triplet pair ratio controlled by hyperfine interactions between nuclear and electron/hole spins as well as dipole-dipole/exchange interactions between electron and hole spins, providing a novel mechanism for magnetometry sensing at elevated temperatures. A critical advantage of our approach is its low power consumption -less than 0.5 W at 500$^\circ$C for magnetic fields below 5 Gauss. This approach provides a sensitive, reliable, and scalable solution with promising applications in space exploration, automotive systems, and industrial sectors, where high performance in extreme conditions is essential.

# Continuous-wave cryogenic optical absorption spectrometer for sub-THz frequencies

## 亚太赫兹频率连续波低温光学吸收光谱仪

arXiv:2411.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design of a continuous-wave, highly sensitive optical spectrometer for millimeter-wave frequencies between 50 and 1000 GHz. The spectrometer uses photomixing of near-infrared light to generate radiation in a wide frequency range, and the absorbed optical power is determined directly through measurements of the sample temperature. This enables relative sensitivities of up to $10^6$ for the sample absorption coefficient below liquid-helium temperatures, suitable for measurements on highly reflective samples. The instrument is also compatible with high magnetic fields. In order to validate its performance, we measure the ferromagnetic resonance in the Mott insulator YTiO$_3$, the electron spin resonance in a standard free-radical reference compound, and the antiferromagnetic resonance in a van der Waals magnetic material.

# Tunable collective electromagnetic induced transparency-like effect due to coupling of dual-band bound states in the continuum

## 由于连续体中双频束缚态的耦合而引起的可调谐集体电磁感应透明效应

arXiv:2411.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between dual-band or multi-band quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) is of great interest for their rich physics and promising applications. Here, we report tunable collective electromagnetic induced transparency-like (EIT-like) phenomenon due to coupling between dual-band collective electric dipolar and magnetic quadrupolar q-BICs, which are supported by an all-dielectric metasurface composed of periodic tilted silicon quadrumers. We show that this collective EIT-like phenomenon with strong slow light effect can be realized by varying the nanodisk diameter or the tilt angle, and that the transparency window wavelength, the quality factor, and the group index can all be tuned by changing the nanodisk size. We further find that as the nanodisk size decreases, the slow light effect becomes stronger, and higher sensitivity can be obtained for the refractive index sensing. Interestingly, the sensitivity first increases exponentially and then reaches a plateau as the nanodisk size decreases, or equivalently as the group index increases. We therefore expect this work will advance the understanding of the collective EIT-like effect due to coupling between q-BICs, and the findings will have potential applications in slow-light enhanced biochemical sensing.

# Electrodynamics of Photonic Temporal Interfaces

arXiv:2411.15984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic forms of wave control have been emerging by engineering matter in space and time. In this framework, temporal photonic interfaces, i.e., abrupt changes in the electromagnetic properties of a material, have been shown to induce temporal scattering phenomena dual to spatial reflection and refraction, at the basis of photonic time crystals and space-time metamaterials. Despite decades-old theoretical studies on these topics, and recent experimental demonstrations, the careful modeling of these phenomena has been lagging behind. Here, we develop from first principles a rigorous model of the electrodynamics of temporal photonic interfaces, highlighting the crucial role of the mechanisms driving time variations. We demonstrate that the boundary conditions and conservation laws associated with temporal scattering may substantially deviate from those commonly employed in the literature, based on their microscopic implementation. Our results open new vistas for both fundamental investigations over light-matter interactions in time-varying structures and for the prospect of their future implementations and applications in optics and photonics.

# Stability of Crossed-Field Amplifiers

## 交叉场放大器的稳定性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16066

arXiv:2411.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research examines the stability of crossed-field amplifiers (CFAs) and characterizes their different modes of operation: amplification, driven oscillation, and self-excited oscillation. The CFA used in this paper is the Recirculating Planar Crossed-Field Amplifier (RPCFA), which is a high power (MW) pulsed (300 ns) amplifier that operates around 3 GHz. Initially, the RPCFA is shown to be a stable amplifier with moderate gain (5.1 dB), but by either reducing the anode-cathode (AK) gap spacing or increasing the driving current, the amplifier operation transitions from amplification to oscillation. Depending on the operating conditions, these oscillations are either driven by the input RF signal or self-excited. These self-excited oscillations can have a lower synchronization phase velocity than the maximum velocity in the electron beam, implying that slower electrons within the Brillouin hub can interact with electromagnetic modes on the RF circuit. A cold tube analysis of the RPCFA shows that the Q-factor of certain modes on the RF circuit varies significantly when the AK gap geometry of the RPCFA is altered which leads to a discrete shift in operating frequency. The operation of the RPCFA close to Hull cutoff is found to share some key features of magnetically insulated transmission line oscillators (MILO) that could also explain the dramatic frequency shift. Instantaneous phase analysis by Hilbert transforms can be used, in conjunction with the frequency and output power analysis, to determine the onset of the transition from amplification to oscillation, and to characterize the oscillation.

Abstract: Superconducting magnets with non-circular apertures are important for handling unconventional beam profiles and specialized accelerator applications. This paper presents an analytical framework for designing superconducting accelerator magnets with quasi-polygonal apertures, aimed at generating precise circular field harmonics. In Part 1, we explore the relationship between current distributions on quasi-polygonal formers and their corresponding magnetic field harmonics. By employing conformal mapping techniques, we establish a connection between the design of quasi-polygonal bore magnets and traditional circular bore configurations, facilitating the simplification of complex mathematical formulations. Part 2 applies the derived current distributions to the canted cosine theta (CCT) coil magnet concept, focusing on designing analytic winding schemes that generate single or mixed circular harmonics within quasi-polygonal apertures. This work not only advances the design of superconducting magnets but also broadens the scope of CCT technology to accommodate more complex geometries.

# Radiation Pattern Synthesis with Uniform Nonlocal Metasurfaces

## 具有均匀非局部超表面的辐射方向图合成

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16210

arXiv:2411.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main applications of electromagnetic metasurfaces (MSs) is to tailor spatial field distributions. The radiation pattern of a given source can be desirably modified upon reflection on an MS having proper spatial modulation of its local macroscopic parameters. At the microscopic level, spatial modulation requires individually engineered meta-atoms at different points. In contrast, the present research demonstrates the opportunity for radiation pattern engineering in the reflection regime without using any spatial modulation. The principle consists in the deliberate tailoring of the surface impedance of an unmodulated but spatially dispersive (nonlocal) MS. A 2D synthesis problem with a magnetic line current source is solved analytically by finding a required form of the surface impedance as a function of the tangential wave vector in both visible and evanescent parts of the spatial spectrum. To prove the principle, three different pattern shapes are implemented via full-wave numerical simulations by tuning the spatial dispersion in a realistic mushroom-type high-impedance electromagnetic surface with loaded vias. This work extends the synthesis methods and the application area of spatially dispersive MSs, showing the latter as a promising platform for new types of antennas.

arXiv:2411.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating intensity, phase and polarization of the electromagnetic fields on ultrafast timescales is essential for all-optical switching, optical information processing and development of novel time-variant media. Noble metal based plasmonics has provided numerous platforms for optical switching and control, enabled by strong local field enhancement, artificially engineered dispersion and strong Kerr-type free-electron nonlinearities. However, precise control over switching times and spectrum remains challenging, commonly limited by the relaxation of hot-electron gas on picosecond time scales and the band structure of materials. Here we experimentally demonstrate the strong and tuneable nonlinearity in a metamaterial on a mirror geometry, controlled by the wavelength of excitation, which imprints a specific non-uniform hot-electron population distribution and drives targeted electron and lattice dynamics. The interplay of electromagnetic, electronic and mechanical energy exchange allows us to achieve sub-300~fs timescales in the recovery of optical constants in the selected spectral domains, where the modulation surpasses the limitations imposed by the inherent material response of metamaterial components, owing to emergence of a Fano-type destructive interference with acoustic vibrations of the metamaterial, featured in reflection but not in transmission. The observed effects are highly spectrally selective and sensitive to the polarisation properties of light and the Fabry-Perot modes of the metamaterial, opening a pathway for controlling the switching rates by spectral selection and nanostructure design. The capability to manipulate temporal, spectral and mechanical aspects of light-matter interactions underscores new potential nonlinear applications where polarisation diversity, spectral selectivity and fast modulation are important.

arXiv:2411.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of the presence of cosmic fluid on the magnetosonic waves and modulation instabilities in the interstellar medium of spiral galaxies is investigated. The fluid model is developed by modifying the pressure equation in such dissipative rotating magnetoplasmas incorporating thermal ionized gas and cosmic rays. Applying the normal mode analysis, a modified dispersion relation is derived to study linear magnetosonic wave modes and their instabilities. The cosmic rays influence the wave damping by accelerating the damping rate. The standard reductive perturbation method is employed in the fluid model leading to a Korteweg de Vries Burgers (KdVB) equation in the small-amplitude limit. Several nonlinear wave shapes are assessed by solving the KdVB equation, analytically and numerically. The cosmic ray diffusivity and magnetic resistivity are responsible for the generation of shock waves. The modulational instability (MI) and the rogue wave solutions of the magnetosonic waves are studied by deriving a nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation from the obtained KdVB equation under the assumption that the cosmic ray diffusion and magnetic resistivity are weak and the carrier wave frequency is considerably lower than the wave frequency. The influence of various plasma parameters on the growth rate of MI is examined. The modification of the pressure term due to cosmic fluid reduces the MI growth in the interstellar medium. In addition, a quantitative analysis of the characteristics of rogue wave solutions is presented. Our investigation's applicability to the interstellar medium of spiral galaxies is traced out.

# The Spatiotemporal Structure of Induced Magnetic Fields in Callisto's Plasma Environment due to their Propagation with MHD Modes

arXiv:2411.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the spatiotemporal structure of induced magnetic fields outside of Callisto is affected by their propagation with the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes. At moons that are surrounded by dense magnetized plasmas like the Galilean moons, low-frequency induced magnetic fields cannot propagate with the ordinary electromagnetic mode as is implicitly used by standard analytical expressions. Instead, the induced magnetic fields propagate with the MHD modes, which exhibit anisotropic propagation properties and have finite velocities. Using an MHD framework, we model the spatiotemporal effects of the transport on the induced signals and analyze their contribution to Galileo's C03 and C09 flyby observations. We find that the induced magnetic field in Callisto's plasma environment is asymmetric with a pronounced upstream/downstream asymmetry. By neglecting the transport effects, the amplitude of the induced magnetic field is under- or overestimated by up to tens of percent, respectively. Additionally, we find that MHD wave and convection velocities are strongly reduced in Callisto's local plasma environment, resulting in an additional temporal delay between the emergence of the induced field at the surface of Callisto or the top of its ionosphere and the measurements at spacecraft location. The associated phase shift depends on the location of the observer and can reach values of several to tens of degrees of the phase of the primary inducing frequency. Transport effects impact the observed induction signals and are consistent with the C03 and C09 magnetic field measurements.

# Electronic Trap Detection with Carrier-Resolved Photo-Hall Effect

## 具有载流子分辨光霍尔效应的电子陷阱检测

arXiv:2411.16092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic trap states are a critical yet unavoidable aspect of semiconductor devices, impacting performance of various electronic devices such as transistors, memory devices, solar cells, and LEDs. The density, energy level, and position of these trap states often enable or constrain device functionality, making their measurement crucial in materials science and device fabrication. Most methods for measuring trap states involve fabricating a junction, which can inadvertently introduce or alter traps, highlighting the need for alternative, less-invasive techniques. Here, we present a unique photo-Hall-based method to detect and characterize trap density and energy level while concurrently extracting key carrier properties, including mobility, photocarrier density, recombination lifetime, and diffusion length. This technique relies on analyzing the photo-Hall data in terms of "photo-Hall conductivity" vs. electrical conductivity under varying light intensities and temperatures. We show that the photo-Hall effect, in the presence of traps, follows an $\textit{astonishingly simple}$ relationship - $\textit{a hyperbola equation}$ - that reveals detailed insights into charge transport and trap occupation. We have successfully applied this technique to P and N-type silicon as a benchmark and to high-performance halide perovskite photovoltaic films. This technique substantially expands the capability of Hall effect-based measurements by integrating the effects of the four most common excitations in nature - electric field, magnetic field, photon, and phonon in solids - into a single equation and enabling unparalleled extraction of charge carrier and trap properties in semiconductors.

arXiv:2411.16484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the first in a series, we present a new theoretical model for the global structure and dissipation of relativistically magnetized collisionless shock waves. Quite remarkably, we find that in contrast to unmagnetized shocks, energy dissipation does not involve collective plasma interactions. Rather, it is a consequence of nonlinear particle dynamics. We demonstrate that the kinetic-scale shock transition can be modeled as a stationary system consisting of a large set of cold beams coupled through the magnetic field. The fundamental mechanism governing shock dissipation relies on the onset of chaos in orbital dynamics within quasiperiodic solitonic structures. We discuss the impact of upstream temperature and magnetization on the shock profile, recovering the magnetic field compression, downstream velocities, and heating expected from the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. We deduce a rate of entropy generation from the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents and discuss the thermalization of the beam distribution. Our model provides a general framework to study magnetized collisionless shock structures.

Abstract: The solar wind, classified by its bulk speed and the Alfv\'enic nature of its fluctuations, generates the heliosphere. The elusive physical processes responsible for the generation of the different types of the wind are a topic of active debate. Recent observations revealed intermittent jets with kinetic energy in the picoflare range, emerging from dark areas of a polar coronal hole threaded by open magnetic field lines. These could substantially contribute to the solar wind. However, their ubiquity and direct links to the solar wind have not been established. Here we report a unique set of remote-sensing and in-situ observations from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, that establish a unified picture of the fast and Alfv\'enic slow wind, connected to the similar widespread picoflare jet activity in two coronal holes. Radial expansion of coronal holes ultimately regulates the speed of the emerging wind.

arXiv:2411.16535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion bridges (DB) have emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion models for imaging inverse problems, achieving faster sampling by directly bridging low- and high-quality image distributions. While incorporating measurement consistency has been shown to improve performance, existing DB methods fail to maintain this consistency in blind inverse problems, where the forward model is unknown. To address this limitation, we introduce ADOBI (Adaptive Diffusion Bridge for Inverse Problems), a novel framework that adaptively calibrates the unknown forward model to enforce measurement consistency throughout sampling iterations. Our adaptation strategy allows ADOBI to achieve high-quality parallel magnetic resonance imaging (PMRI) reconstruction in only 5-10 steps. Our numerical results show that ADOBI consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, and further advances the Pareto frontier for the perception-distortion trade-off.

arXiv:2309.02548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic field is traditionally presented as a (pseudo)vector quantity, tied closely to the cross product. Though familiar to experts, many students find these ideas challenging and full of subtleties. Building on earlier work in rotational physics, we present an alternative pedagogical approach that describes magnetic fields using bivectors. These objects can be visualized as oriented tiles whose components form an antisymmetric matrix. Historically, bivectors have been mostly used in specialized contexts like spacetime classification or geometric algebra, but they are not necessarily more complicated to understand than cross products. Teaching magnetism in this language addresses common student difficulties, generalizes directly to relativity (and extra dimensions), and brings fresh insight to familiar ideas.

Abstract: We investigated how students apply the concept of circulation when faced with problems related to the Ampere-Maxwell law. For this purpose, we designed a metacognitive pencil-and-paper question, presented it to 65 students, and analysed their responses using phenomenography. We complemented our research by conducting interviews with 12 students. The results show that students tend to think that they can only use the magnetic field circulation to calculate magnetic fields if the curve used is symmetric, and that they do not take into account the shape of the magnetic field lines when applying it. We also find that some students believe that a variable electric field must cross the entire Amperian curve in order to apply Amp\'ere-Maxwell's law and find the magnetic field.

Abstract: In the past, quasi coherent modes were reported for nearly all tokamaks. The general definition describes modes as quasi coherent when the magnitude squared coherence is in the range of \SIrange{0.3}{0.6}{}. Quasi coherent modes are observed in the plasma core as well as in the plasma edge and can have quite different physical origins. The one in the core are observed in plasmas with low collisionality, where the electron temperature exceeds the ion temperature in the plasma core. This is the case for electron cyclotron heating in general. The origin of these modes are electrons trapped within a magnetic mirror, as reported in the past from various fusion devices. The so-called trapped-electron modes (TEMs) belong to drift wave instabilities and can be destabilized by electron-temperature gradients in the plasma core. From the diagnostic point of view, quasi coherent modes appear as fluctuations in electron density and temperature. Therefore, the microwave reflectometer is very well suited to monitor these modes. This paper describes experiments, conducted at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator (W7-X), which aim at detecting quasi coherent modes at low wave numbers. A Poloidal Correlation Reflectometer (PCR) installed at W7-X, is able to measure low wave numbers ($k_\perp\le 3.5$ cm$^{-1}$). For different magnetic configurations and plasma parameters, broad quasi-coherent structures are observed in the coherence spectra. From the analysis of the rotation and the poloidal structure, these quasi coherent (QC) modes show the properties of electron-temperature-gradient driven TEMs. A linear relation between the mode velocity and the rotation frequency is found. The relation is uniform and confirms the nature of QC-mode observation as TEM in tokamaks, too.

arXiv:2409.11944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasispecies concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called "Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the "Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalize this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to variations in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution as the order parameter.

Furthermore, with engaging illustrative examples, we showcase the versatility and applications of space-time-varying media.

Abstract: Chemiresistive materials, which alter their electrical resistance in response to interactions with surrounding chemicals, are valued for their robustness, rapid detection ability and high sensitivity. Recent research has revealed that the sensing performance of these materials can be enhanced by applying an external magnetic field. In this study, we report a novel finding in the chemiresistive behavior of magnetite (Fe3O4), where its response has been found to be modulated in an anisotropic manner when exposed to an external magnetic field, analogous to Earth's magnetic field. Remarkably, substantial variations have been observed in response to analytes naturally present in the atmosphere. This chemiresistive response exhibits a strong anisotropic dependence on the strength, direction and inclination of the magnetic field, suggesting that magnetite's electrical resistance dynamically adapts to both magnetic and chemical environmental changes. The observed behavior under Earth-like magnetic field closely mirrors the magnetoreception seen in migratory species that rely on magnetite for navigation. This finding may provide new insights into the mechanisms behind magnetite-based magnetoreception observed in various biological species.

Abstract: The development of spintronic emitters of broadband THz pulses relies on designing heterostructures where processes of laser-driven spin current generation and subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion are the most efficient. An interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the emitter is one of the critical elements. Here, we study experimentally single-cycle THz pulse generation from a laser-pulse excited Pt/Co emitter with a composition gradient interface between Pt and Co and compare it with the emission from a conventional Pt/Co structure with an abrupt interface. We find that the gradient interface enhances the efficiency of optics-to-THz conversion by a factor of two in a wide range of optical fluences up to 3 mJ cm$^{-2}$. We reveal that this enhancement is caused by a pronounced increase in transmittance of the laser-driven spin-polarized current through the gradient interface compared to the abrupt one. Furthermore, we find that such a transmission deteriorates with laser fluence due to the spin accumulation effect.

arXiv:2411.14787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin structure of weakly bound diatomic van der Waals molecules formed by two identical bosonic alkali atoms. Our studies were performed using known Born-Oppenheimer potentials while developing a reduced interaction potential model. Such reduced potential models are currently a key for solving certain classes of few-body problems of atoms as they decrease the numerical burden on the computation. Although the reduced potentials are significantly shallower than actual Born-Oppenheimer potentials, they still capture the main properties of the near-threshold bound states, including their spin structure, and the scattering states over a broad range of magnetic fields. At zero magnetic field, we find that the variation in spin structure across different alkali species originates from the interplay between electronic spin exchange and hyperfine interactions. To characterize this competition we introduce a single parameter, which is a function of the singlet and triplet scattering lengths, the atomic hyperfine splitting constant, and the molecular binding energy. We show that this parameter can be used to classify the spin structure of vdW molecules for each atomic species.

Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.

Abstract: We revealed the anomalous temperature behavior of the giant dielectric permittivity and unusual frequency dependences of the pyroelectric response of the fine-grained ceramics prepared by the spark plasma sintering of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The temperature dependences of the electro-resistivity indicate the frequency-dependent transition in the electro-transport mechanisms between the lower and higher conductivity states accompanied by the maximum in the temperature dependence of the loss angle tangent. The pyroelectric thermal-wave probing revealed the existence of the spatially inhomogeneous counter-polarized ferroelectric state at the opposite surfaces of the ceramic sample. We described the temperature behavior of the giant dielectric response and losses using the core-shell model for ceramic grains, effective medium approach and Maxwell-Wagner approach. The superparaelectric-like state with a giant dielectric response may appear due to the internal barrier-layer capacitance effect, while the step-like thermal activation of localized polarons in the semiconducting grains is not excluded. The elucidation of the state microscopic origin requires measurements in the frequency range above 1 MHz.

In magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) devices, these tori manifest as closed flux surfaces, with their nested structure governing radial transport and thus playing a critical role in confinement performance. Using the method of variation as a mathematical foundation, this Letter derives formulae that characterize the deformation of invariant tori under perturbation. These results provide new tools for targeted topology control in tokamak operations and for optimizing stellarator designs by enhancing predictive capability for flux surface behaviour.

## 多晶超导体中弹性变形和损伤对涡旋钉扎和Jc退化的交织影响

arXiv:2411.11561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.

# DNA Mimic Foldamer Recognition of a Chromosomal Protein

## 染色体蛋白质的DNA模拟折叠识别

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-9wnb8-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Helical aromatic oligoamide foldamers bearing anionic side chains that mimic the overall shape and charge surface distribution of DNA were synthesized. Their interactions with chromosomal protein Sac7d, a non-sequence-selective DNA-binder that kinks DNA, were investigated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), Circular Dichroism spectroscopy (CD), melting curve analysis, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), as well as by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The foldamers were shown to bind to Sac7d better than a DNA duplex of comparable length. The interaction is diastereoselective and takes place at the DNA binding site. Crystallography revealed that the DNA mimic foldamers have a binding mode of their own and that they can bind to Sac7d without being kinked.

# Facile synthesis and effective adsorption of magnetic alginate biogel composite for lanthanum ions from water

## 磁性海藻酸盐生物凝胶复合物的简易合成及其对水中镧离子的有效吸附

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5218034/latest

A novel eco-friendly magnetic alginate biogel composite (Ca-SA@Fe3O4) was synthesized through droplet polymerization and characterized using multiple techniques. Furthermore, the impact of factors, such as dosage, pH, contact time, temperature and the presence of co-existing ions on the efficiency of the removal for La(III) ions by the composite were systematically investigated. The evaluation and exploration were conducted on the adsorption performance, reusability, and interaction mechanism of the magnetic composite towards La(III) ions. The results show that the magnetic composite gel beats have a particle scale of approximately 1.3 mm, a peculiar folded structure with numerous surface pores and sensitive magnetive responsiveness. La(III)-ion removal from water by Ca-SA@Fe3O4 reached 90.2% at pH 7.0, contact time of 20 h and 298 K. The La(III) adsorption behaviour was in accordance with the Langmuir model, and the maximum adsorption capacity was up to 91.0 mg/g. The spontaneous adsorption process exhibited kinetics that were in accordance with the Pseudo-second-order model, suggesting a favorable agreement. Complexation and electrostatic adsorption between the composite and La(III) ions facilitate the strong adsorption of La(III) ions. The commonly coexisting ions and ionic strength hardly interfered with the La(III) adsorption, apart from a minor influence of Ca2+ ions. The biogel composite following adsorption of La(III) ions can be completely recovered and reused at least four times. Ca-SA@Fe3O4 composite would be a cost-effective macroparticle biosorbent.

# Diagnosis and Management of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome in a Dog: First Report in Veterinary Medicine

## 狗的周期性呕吐综合征的诊断和管理: 兽医学的首次报道

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5355999/latest

Background Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is an idiopathic chronic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of vomiting that are often triggered by psychological stressors and circadian rhythms. While CVS is well-documented in human medicine, this report details the first diagnosis of CVS in veterinary medicine.Case presentation A 16-year-old neutered male Maltese dog presented with a history of daily vomiting that was unresponsive to standard antiemetic therapies. On physical examination, hematologic tests, radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, fluoroscopy, and endoscopy, gastrointestinal and metabolic causes of vomiting were ruled out. In addition, to rule out neurogenic causes of vomiting, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and electroencephalography were performed and showed no remarkable findings. Based on the distinctive vomiting pattern characterized by stress-induced symptoms and association with the circadian rhythm as well as consistency with the clinical criteria used in humans (Rome criteria), the dog was diagnosed with CVS. Therapeutic trials with anticonvulsants, including phenobarbital and levetiracetam, successfully controlled the dog&amp;rsquo;s clinical signs, which were unresponsive to conventional treatments.Conclusions This case emphasizes the potential for CVS in canine species and highlights the need for further exploration of neurogenic vomiting disorders in dogs.

# Clinical Features And Imaging Findings of Early Lacrimal Sac Neoplasms

## 早期泪囊肿瘤的临床特点及影像学表现

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5339944/latest

Background To examine the clinical features and imaging findings of early-stage lacrimal sac neoplasms.Methods In this retrospective study, patients presenting with epiphora were diagnosed with either lacrimal sac neoplasms or mucoceles. Diagnostic assessments included computed tomography (CT), enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pathological analysis.Results The study comprised nine patients (2 male; 7 female) with lacrimal sac neoplasms, 44% of whom had malignancies while 56% exhibited benign conditions. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean width of the nasolacrimal canal between patients with neoplasms (6.49&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;3.68 mm) and mucoceles (5.50&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.88 mm, P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.44). However, the depth of the nasolacrimal canal was significantly greater in the neoplasm group (5.08&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;3.21 mm) compared to the mucocele group (2.85&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.96 mm, P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.05). Notably, lacrimal sac mass extended above the medial canthal tendon in eight neoplasm patients, unlike any in the mucocele group, demonstrating distinct pathological presentations. Additionally, the diseased eyes in the neoplasm group showed significantly greater nasolacrimal canal width (6.49 mm) compared to the contralateral eyes (3.01 mm, P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.01) and a slightly deeper depth (5.08 mm vs. 2.66 mm, P&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.04).Conclusions Findings suggest that a lacrimal sac mass extending above the medial canthal tendon warrants a CT scan. Patients with a nasolacrimal canal wider than the contralateral side should undergo enhanced MRI for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

# Sulfated cellulose pulp with ultra-high water retention characteristics

## 具有超高保水特性的硫酸化纤维素纸浆

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5147146/latest

A sulfated cellulose pulp (SCP) exhibiting ultra-high water retention properties, has been developed and its water retention mechanisms have been analyzed based on its molecular structure determined by solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Cellulose pulp (CP) wood-derived was sulfated using sulfamic acid and urea reaction system with varying concentrations of sulfamic acid. SCP has 1.31&amp;ndash;1.91 mmol/g of sulfate groups and exhibits a high water retention value (WRV) of 16000%, which is approximately 100 times greater than that of CP. After the sulfate reaction, a new peak at 69 ppm was observed in the solid-state 13C NMR spectrum, which was assigned to the sulfated C6. Quantitative analysis indicated that approximately 18% of C6 in CP was converted to sulfated C6. WRV increased almost linearly with the amount of sulfated C6, which played an important role in the water retention capacity. SCP was proven very promising as a novel functional material, owing to the molecular mechanisms involved.

# Synthetic in-plane magnetic fields in topological plasmonic insulator with detachable identical meta-atoms

## 具有可分离的相同元原子的拓扑等离子体绝缘体中的合成面内磁场

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5305977/latest

Synthetic magnetic fields of photons allow to emulate the behavior of electrons in real magnetic fields in photonic systems, providing unprecedented opportunity to explore novel optical phenomena and practical applications. Here, we propose a method for generating an in-plane pseudo-magnetic field by linearly modulating the rotation angle of identical meta-atoms. This approach induces the chiral zeroth Landau level, which is a one-way propagation bulk state with topological protection. Due to the detachable and rotatable characteristics of meta-atoms, we achieve robust propagation of the chiral bulk state and design a flexible Dirac waveguide through manipulating the rotation angle of the meta-atoms. Experimental tests are conducted to verify the transmission characteristics of the Dirac waveguide and chiral zeroth Landau modes. Our system offers a new pathway for realizing the chiral Landau levels in optical metasurfaces with identical meta-atoms and enables the control of a pseudo-magnetic field. Without breaking the time-reversal symmetry with real magnetic fields, our proposed structure has potential for designing integrated photonic devices and may enable further exploration of intriguing physical phenomena through flexible control of the synthetic magnetic field.

A variety of new compounds have been integrated into the structural framework of (5Z)-5-[(2-(4-methylpiperazin-1yl)quinoline-3-yl)methyl]-1,3-thiazolidine-2,4-dione. The synthesis of 1,3-thiazolidine-2,4-dione was accomplished by means of the condensation of 2-chloroquinoline, which later functioned as a pivotal reagent in the reaction with 3-carbaldehydes, resulting in the production of 2,4-thiazolidinedione. The characterization of these recently synthesised compounds was performed by their interactions with halide compounds, namely involving substituted N-alkylation. Chemical identification was achieved by using elemental analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR). Additionally, the synthesised compounds were subjected to in vitro testing to assess their antibacterial activity against a range of pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

# Edge Polarization Topology Integrated with Sliding Ferroelectricity in Moir&eacute; System

## 莫尔系统中集成滑动铁电的边缘极化拓扑

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5377031/latest

Van der Waals moir&eacute; heterostructure have been found to exhibits a robust interfacial ferroelectricity down to atomic thickness, and discovering and understanding the complex polarization state in moir&eacute; systems is of fundamental interest to condensed-matter research. In this study, we examined the moir&eacute; ferroelectricity in twisted h-BN heterostructure by piezoresponse force microscopy. Due to atomic reconstruction, triangular moir&eacute; patterns are detected, and we have directly observed sliding ferroelectricity in the center of triangular moir&eacute; patterns as well as robust in-plane polarization topology emerging at the boundary of adjacent triangles, which we call edge ferroelectricity. The edge ferroelectricity possesses non-trivial vortex polarization topology. Our calculations trace the origin of this phenomenon to joined piezoelectric effects with sliding ferroelectricity. The present work provides intuitive insights to explore the unique moir&eacute; ferroelectricity in a non-polar background matrix, paving the way for potential ultrathin nonvolatile memory applications.

# PMSM Sensorless Control Based on the IAORLS-Optimized Super-Twisting Algorithm Sliding Mode Observer

## 基于IAORLS优化超扭曲算法滑模观测器的PMSM无传感器控制

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5331530/latest

This paper addresses the chattering issue commonly associated with the sliding mode observer (SMO) algorithm in sensorless control of surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM) and the problem of parameter variation caused by magnetic saturation and temperature rise during motor operation. A novel information acquisition optimized recursive least squares (IAORLS) algorithm, which incorporates an IAO-optimized forgetting factor, is proposed to identify motor parameters. The identified parameters are utilized in conjunction with the Super Twisting Algorithm Sliding Mode Observer (STA-SMO) for motor control. By discretizing the stator voltage equations of the PMSM via the forward Euler method, IAORLS enables efficient parameter identification. These parameters are then integrated into the STA-SMO, allowing the observer to receive real-time updates, thereby preventing performance degradation due to parameter mismatches. Additionally, the method reduces chattering when the motor&rsquo;s back electromotive force (EMF) is observed, improving the accuracy of rotor position and speed estimation. Simulations and experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach.&nbsp;

# Emergence of insulating ferro- and ferrimagnetism with enhanced optical properties in double-double perovskite oxides

## 在双-双钙钛矿氧化物中出现具有增强光学性能的绝缘铁磁和铁磁

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5335245/latest

The emergence of ferro-and ferrimagnetic behavior in insulating materials is uncommon, largely due to Pauli&rsquo;s exclusion principle, which typically favors antiferromagnetic spin alignment between neighboring species. Utilizing symmetry analysis, first-principles methods, and classical Monte Carlo simulations, we report technologically important insulating ferro-and ferrimagnetic double-double perovskite oxides. Our study identifies LaA &prime; MnNiO6 (A &prime; = V, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni) as promising candidates exhibiting band gaps between 1.3 eV and 2.2 eV, calculated using the modified Becke-Johnson exchange-correlation potential. These compounds are particularly relevant for spintronic and optical applications. We explain the mechanisms driving band gap openings and magnetic exchange interactions in these ferro-and ferrimagnetic compounds. Monte Carlo simulations, together with state-of-the-art orbital-decomposed exchange parameter analysis, reveal intriguing variations in magnetic transition temperatures (up to 242 K) and the corresponding exchange mechanisms in all LaA &prime; MnNiO6 compounds are discussed. Additionally, we assess the thermody-namic and dynamic stability of these compounds, confirming their feasibility for practical applications.

# Digital logic from high-efficiency superconducting diodes

## 高效超导二极管的数字逻辑

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5362760/latest

Recent advancements in the realizations of superconducting diodes have pushed the diode coefficient &eta; 
towards its theoretical maximum of &eta;=1. In this work, we describe the construction of logic gates NOT, AND, OR, NAND and NOR using superconducting diodes with &eta;&asymp;1 by exploiting their dynamically tunable polarity. We then argue that fundamental theorems suppress &eta; in intrinsic superconductors, rendering them likely unsuitable for the proposed devices, and point out that several previous proposals and platforms, remarkably, bypassed this suppression unwittingly. We discuss the realization of the digital logic in one such platform -- Josephson triodes that yielded &eta;&asymp;1 -- and argue that phases with spontaneous spatial or magnetic order can overcome some of its drawbacks. Thus, this work provides guiding principles for future platforms and develops the building blocks for superconductors-based digital electronics.
