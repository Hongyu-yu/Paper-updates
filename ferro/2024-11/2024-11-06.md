# Hot Electron-Driven Structural Expansion and Magnetic Collapse in Bilayer FeSe

## 双层FeSe中热电子驱动的结构膨胀和磁塌陷

arXiv:2411.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena emerging from the interaction of light and matter in low-dimensional systems hold great potential for future quantum technologies. Here, using first-principles calculations incorporating non-local van der Waals interactions and Hubbard corrections, we report simultaneous structural expansion and magnetic collapse in bilayer FeSe induced by photoexcited hot electrons. Our calculations reveal that, while bulk FeSe is paramagnetic, as observed experimentally, double-layer FeSe exhibits robust {\it staggered} antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures with a net site magnetization of $\sim 2.75~\mu_B$/Fe. However, increasing the density of photoexcited electrons systematically enhances the internal electronic entropy, leading to a complete collapse of antiferromagnetic order accompanied by an abrupt expansion of the interlayer separation. Our findings suggest the structural and magnetic properties of FeSe thin films can be finely tuned via ultrafast laser excitation, offering a pathway to control quantum phases in iron-based compounds through electronic temperature.

# Tuning the lasing threshold of quantum well exciton-polaritons under a perpendicular magnetic field: a theoretical study

arXiv:2411.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.

# Adatom engineering magnetic order in superconductors: Applications to altermagnetic superconductivity

## 超导体中的原子工程磁序: 在磁超导中的应用

arXiv:2411.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically how superlattices based on adatoms on surfaces of unconventional superconductors can be used to engineer novel pairing states that break time-reversal symmetry and exhibit non-trivial magnetic point symmetries. We illustrate this using a square-lattice Hubbard model with $d$-wave superconductivity and a subleading $s$-wave state as an example. An adatom superlattice with square-lattice symmetries is shown to stabilize an "orbital-altermagnetic superconductor'', a state that exhibits loop current patterns and associated orbital magnetic moments, which preserve superlattice translations but are odd under four-fold rotations. This state is further characterized by a non-zero Berry curvature quadrupole moment and, upon including spin-orbit coupling, by an altermagnetic spin splitting of the bands and non-trivial spin textures in the superlattice unit cell, with zero net spin moment.

# Origin of Anomalous Hall effect in Cr-doped RuO$_2$

## Cr掺杂RuO $_2 $ 中反常霍尔效应的起源

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02507

arXiv:2411.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RuO$_2$ is one of the most highlighted candidates for altermagnetism. However, the most recent muon spin spectroscopy and neutron studies demonstrated the absence of magnetic order in this system. The electronic structure of RuO$_2$ hints at a possibility of realizing a magnetically ordered state upon hole doping, and such a possibility was explored experimentally in Cr-doped RuO$_2$, where it was suggested that this system exhibits the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to altermagnetism. In this manuscript, based on our density functional calculations, we revise the results obtained for this system and propose a different interpretation of experimental results. Our calculations suggest that extra holes are bound to Cr impurity and do not dope Ru bands, which remain nonmagnetic. Thus, the observed AHE is not due to the altermagnetism but stems entirely from magnetic Cr ions.

arXiv:2411.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of phase transitions in frustrated magnetic systems with $O(N)\times O(2)$ symmetry has been the subject of controversy for more than twenty years, with theoretical, numerical and experimental results in disagreement. Even theoretical studies lead to different results, with some predicting a first-order phase transition while others find it to be second-order. Recently, a series of results from both numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, in particular those based on the Conformal Bootstrap, have rekindled interest in this controversy, especially as they are still not in agreement with each other. Studies based on the functional renormalization group have played a major role in this controversy in the past, and we revisit these studies, taking them a step further by adding non-trivial second order derivative terms to the derivative expansion of the effective action. We confirm the first-order nature of the phase transition for physical values of $N$, i.e. for $N=2$ and $N=3$ in agreement with the latest results obtained with the Conformal Bootstrap. We also study an other phase of the $O(N)\times O(2)$ models, called the sinusoidal phase, qualitatively confirming earlier perturbative results.

# Fate of the Josephson effect and odd-frequency pairing in superconducting junctions with unconventional magnets

## 具有非常规磁体的超导结中的约瑟夫森效应和奇数频率配对的命运

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02679

arXiv:2411.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Josephson junctions formed by coupling two conventional superconductors via an unconventional magnet and investigate the formation of Andreev bound states, their impact on the Josephson effect, and the emergent superconducting correlations. We focus on unconventional magnets known as $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound states in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions strongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and low-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are insensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states can be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction, which also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are prone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the magnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also demonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson junctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order, while the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the currents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent. Our results can serve as a guide to pursue the new functionality of Josephson junctions based on unconventional magnets.

# Clear Reduction in Spin Susceptibility and Superconducting Spin Rotation for $H \parallel a$ in the Early-Stage Sample of Spin-Triplet Superconductor UTe$_2$

arXiv:2411.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the re-measurement of the $a$-axis spin susceptibility component in an early-stage sample of the spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ with the transition temperature of $T_{\rm SC}$ = 1.6 K. Using Knight-shift measurements along the $b$ axis and at a 10-degree tilt from the $b$ axis towards the $a$ axis, we accurately determined the $a$-axis component without directly measuring the $a$-axis Knight shift. Our results reveal a decrease of approximately 3\% in the $a$-axis spin susceptibility in the superconducting state under $a$-axis magnetic field $\mu_0 H_a \sim 0.1$ T, indicating that the spin susceptibility decreases similarly in both early-stage and ultraclean samples with $T_{\rm SC}$ = 2.1 K. The previously reported absence of the reduction in Knight shift is attributed to the missing of signal from the superconducting region and to the detection of residual signals from the non-superconducting region instead. We also found that the decrease in the $a$-axis spin susceptibility is immediately suppressed with increasing the $a$-axis magnetic field and is estimated to be completely suppressed at around 1.5 T due to superconducting spin rotation.

# Extraction and Simulation of the Impact of Flux Trapping in Moats of AC-Biased Shift Registers

arXiv:2411.02749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moats in superconducting ground planes are used to trap magnetic flux away from sensitive parts of superconductor integrated circuits. We simulate the effect of magnetic flux trapped in moats on the operating margins of ac-biased SFQ shift registers (ShReg) with two ground planes for various congruent moat geometries, moat sizes, locations in the ShReg cells, number and polarity of the trapped of fluxons. Using inductance extractor InductEx, we extract mutual couplings between the moats and the ShReg inductors and include them in the refined netlist. Then, we use JoSim to simulate the circuit operation and find the threshold ac clock amplitude above which the register starts to operate correctly. The relative change in this threshold is used to characterize the influence of flux trapping on the circuit operation. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to investigate the effect of the circuit parameter variations on the statistics of the threshold, using the standard deviation of the Josephson junction critical current and of the circuit inductance extracted from the fabrication process control monitors. The obtained distributions are compared with the independently measured distributions of the threshold amplitude for the individual cells of ac-biased shift registers with 108,500 Josephson junctions. The results show that flux trapping in properly designs moats have a very small effect on the operation margins of the large-scale shift registers whereas the main contribution to the cell-to-cell variation of the threshold comes from the variation of the junctions' critical currents.

# Strong coupling of a superconducting flux qubit to single bismuth donors

## 超导通量量子位与单个铋供体的强耦合

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02852

arXiv:2411.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of a quantum computer represents a tremendous scientific and technological challenge due to the extreme fragility of quantum information. The physical support of information, namely the quantum bit or qubit, must at the same time be strongly coupled to other qubits by gates to compute information, and well decoupled from its environment to keep its quantum behavior. An interesting physical system for realizing such qubits are magnetic impurities in semiconductors, such as bismuth donors in silicon. Indeed, spins associated to bismuth donors can reach an extremely long coherence time -- of the order of seconds. Yet it is extremely difficult to establish and control efficient gates between these spins. Here we demonstrate a protocol where single bismuth donors can coherently transfer their quantum information to a superconducting flux qubit, which acts as a mediator or quantum bus. This superconducting device allows to connect distant spins on-demand with little impact on their coherent behavior.

arXiv:2411.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honeycomb lattice Kitaev magnets exhibit exotic magnetic properties governed by the Kitaev interaction. This study delves into $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, a prototypical example described by effective Hamiltonians encompassing bond-dependent Kitaev interactions alongside additional terms such as the Heisenberg interaction and symmetric off-diagonal exchange interactions. These non-Kitaev terms significantly influence $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$'s low-temperature magnetism, impacting both magnetic order and excitations. We employ spin-wave theory to elucidate the topological nature of magnetic excitations within the polarized state of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under an external magnetic field. Our focus lies on transverse magnon conductivities, specially the thermal Hall conductivity and spin Nernst coefficient. The calculations unveil a pronounced dependence of the magnitude and sign structure of the low-temperature transverse thermal conductivities on both the applied magnetic field's orientation and the exchange parameters within the nearest neighbor Heisenberg-Kitaev-Gamma-Gamma$'$ $(JK\Gamma\Gamma')$ model, which govern the nature and strength of spin interactions. This theoretical framework facilitates critical comparisons with experimental observations, ultimately aiding the identification of an effective Hamiltonian for Kitaev magnets exemplified by $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

# Gyrotropic Magnetic Effect in Black Phosphorus Irradiated with Bicircular Light

arXiv:2411.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gyrotropic magnetic effect, manifesting as a gyropropic current under a slowly-varying magnetic field, represents a fundamental property of Bloch electrons on the Fermi surface; however, it has not been observed in experiments. Here, we theoretically propose that Floquet engineering with bicircular light (BCL), which is a superposition of two opposite chiral waves of circularly polarized light with an integer frequency ratio, presents a fascinating strategy to generate and manipulate the gyrotropic magnetic effect in nodal line semimetals. The tailoring spatial symmetry of BCL irradiation can induce a topological transition from a nodal line semimetallic phase to a Weyl semimetallic phase characterized by a minimum number of misaligned Weyl nodes, resulting in the generation of gyrotropic current when a slowly oscillating magnetic field is applied. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we show that the compressed black phosphorus under irradiation of BCL is an ideal candidate to realize the large gyropropic current with great advantages. Our work not only broadens potential candidate materials for achieving the experimentally accessible gyropropic current, but also provides deeper insights into the interplay between topological phenomena and light manipulation of symmetries.

arXiv:2411.02965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Re5+(5d2) compounds possess large spin-orbital interaction which urges for large anisotropy, non-collinear structures and other phenomena. Here we present ReCl5 composed by separate Re2Cl10 units formed by edge-shared chlorine octahedra. It demonstrates the formation of antiferromagnetically ordered state in two steps at TN1 = 35.5 K and TN2 = 13.2 K seen in dc-, ac-magnetic susceptibility and in specific heat. At 4K it can be transformed to the state with spontaneous magnetic moment by relatively weak magnetic field m0H = 0.5 T via metamagnetic phase transition. Ab initio calculations give anisotropic ferromagnetic exchange interactions J1 and J2 within and between rhenium pairs forming the zig-zag chains along the a-axis. Pairs of zig-zag chains are coupled by ferromagnetic interaction J3 along the c-axis into magnetic honeycomb ladders. The ladders are coupled by significantly weaker interaction J4.

# Reconfigurable SWCNT ferroelectric field-effect transistor arrays

## 可重构SWCNT铁电场效应晶体管阵列

arXiv:2411.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable devices have garnered significant attention for alleviating the scaling requirements of conventional CMOS technology, as they require fewer components to construct circuits with similar function. Prior works required continuous voltage application for programming gate terminal(s) in addition to the primary gate terminal, which undermines the advantages of reconfigurable devices in realizing compact and power-efficient integrated circuits. Here, we realize reconfigurable devices based on a single-gate field-effect transistor (FET) architecture by integrating semiconducting channels consisting of a monolayer film of highly aligned SWCNTs with a ferroelectric AlScN gate dielectric, all compatible with CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing. We demonstrated these SWCNT ferroelectric FETs (FeFETs) in a centimeter-scale array (~1 cm^2) comprising ~735 devices, with high spatial uniformity in device characteristics across the array. The devices exhibited ambipolar transfer characteristics with high on-state currents and current on/off ratios exceeding 10^5, demonstrating an excellent balance between electron and hole conduction (~270 {\mu}A/{\mu}m at a drain voltage of 3 V. When functioning as a non-volatile memory, the SWCNT FeFETs demonstrated large memory windows of 0.26 V/nm and 0.08 V/nm in the hole and electron conduction regions, respectively, combined with excellent retention behavior for up to 10^4 s. Repeated reconfiguration between p-FET and n-FET modes was also enabled by switching the spontaneous polarization in AlScN and operating the transistor within a voltage range below the coercive voltage. We revealed through circuit simulations that reconfigurable SWCNT transistors can realize ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) with far fewer devices compared to circuits based on silicon CMOS technology or based on resistive non-volatile devices.

Abstract: Recently discovered high-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La-327) is believed to be driven by the non-phononic repulsive interaction. Depending on the strength of the interlayer repulsion, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is expected to be either $d$-wave or sign-changing bonding-antibonding $s_{\pm}$-wave. Unfortunately, due to the need of high pressure to reach superconducting phase, conventional spectroscopic probes to validate the symmetry of the order parameter are hard to use. Here, we study the effect of the point-like non-magnetic impurities on the superconducting state of La-327 and show that $s_{\pm}$-wave and $d$-wave symmetries show a very different behavior as a function of impurity concentration, which can be studied experimentally by irradiating the La-327 samples by electrons prior applying the pressure. While $d-$wave superconducting state will be conventionally suppressed, the $s_{\pm}$-wave state shows more subtle behavior, depending on the asymmetry between bonding and antibonding subspaces. For the electronic structure, predicted to realize in La-327, the $s_{\pm}-$wave state will be robust against complete suppression and the transition temperature, $T_c$ demonstrates a transition from convex to concave behavior, indicating a crossover from $s_{\pm}$-wave to $s_{++}$-wave symmetry as a function of impurity concentration. We further analyze the sensitivity of the obtained results with respect to the potential electronic structure modification.

Abstract: We develop a method for entangling operations on nuclear spins surrounding a negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-center) point defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). To this end, we propose to employ the electron spin of a VB-center as a control qubit. We show that in the presence of a background magnetic field and by applying control pulses one can collectively manipulate the state of the nuclei with $\hat{U}_z$ and $\hat{U}_x$ rotations. These rotations can serve for implementing the synchronous three-qubit $X$, $Z$, and the Hadamard gates. Through our numerical analyses considering realistic system parameters and the decoherence effects, we demonstrate that these gates can be executed with high fidelities. Furthermore, as an example for the application of our toolbox, we utilize these collective gates to prepare the highly entangled GHZ states among the three nuclear spins with a fidelity of $0.99$. By including the electron decoherence effects we find that the relative deviations of the gate fidelities from the noisy terms are negligibly small, proving the noise-resilience of our protocols. Our work can serve as the groundstone for exploiting the nuclear spins in hBN in future quantum technological applications.

Abstract: The modern Hopfield network, proposed by Krotov and Hopfield, is a mathematical generalization of the Hopfield network, which is a basic model of associative memory that employs higher-order interactions. This study introduces an open quantum model for discrete modern Hopfield networks that generalizes the open quantum Hopfield network. Our model integrates dissipative quantum spin systems, governed by quantum master equations, with classical hopping terms and additional quantum effects through a transverse field. We analytically examined the behavior of the stable fixed points and numerically determined the phase diagram. The results demonstrated qualitatively distinct behaviors from the open quantum Hopfield network, showing that the ferromagnetic and limit cycle phases have additional stable fixed points.

Abstract: We consider the linear response of a near-equilibrium charged relativistic gas in the presence of electromagnetic and gravitational field in a generic stationary spacetime up to the second order of relaxation time and calculate the tensorial kinetic coefficients introduced by the presence of the strong electromagnetic and/or gravitational field. Using the covariant transfer equations thus developed, a covariant heat equation governing the relativistic heat conduction is derived, which, in Minkowski spacetime, reduces into a form which is remarkably similar to the well-known Cattaneo equation but with a different sign in front of the second-order time derivative term. We also perform a comparative analysis on the different behaviors of our heat equation and the Cattaneo equation in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, the effect of gravity on the heat conduction predicted by our heat equation is illustrated around Schwarzschild black hole, which makes a sharp contrast to the Minkowski case.

Abstract: Topology is the study of geometrical properties and spatial relations unaffected by continuous changes, and has become an important tool for understanding complex physical systems. Although recent optical experiments have inferred the existence of vector fields with the topologies of merons, the inability to extract the full three dimensional vectors misses a richer set of topologies that have not yet been fully explored. In our work, we extend the study of the topology of electromagnetic fields on surfaces to a spin quasi-particle with the topology of a meron pair, formed by interfering surface plasmon polaritons, and show that the in-plane vectors are constrained by the embedding topology of the space as dictated by the Poincare-Hopf theorem. In addition we explore the time evolution of the three dimensional topology of the spin field formed by femtosecond laser pulses. These experiments are possible using our here developed method called polarimetric photoemission electron microscopy (polarimetric PEEM) that combines an optical pump-probe technique and polarimetry with photo-emission electron microscopy. This method allows for the accurate generation of surface plasmon polariton fields and their subsequent measurement, revealing both the spatial distribution of the full three-dimensional electromagnetic fields at deep sub-wavelength resolution and their time evolution.

Abstract: Controlling macroscopic properties of quantum materials requires the ability to induce and manipulate excited states. The set of collective excitations of a solid is encoded in its dispersion relations. We find that the spectra of the low-momentum eigenmodes are renormalized by resonantly driving the high-momentum excitations. Our experimental data rule out laser-induced thermal processes as an origin of the renormalization. The photoinduced changes of the amplitudes and frequencies can be explained theoretically and numerically with a resonant light-scattering mechanism that couples high- and low-momentum eigenmodes in the dispersion relation across momentum space. While we demonstrate the renormalization of the magnetic spectrum in a quantum material, our experimental approach can be further generalized to lattice modes in semiconductors.

Abstract: In this study, ultrafast optical spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the intricate topological features of EuIn$_2$As$_2$, a promising candidate for a magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator. Our investigation, focusing on the real-time evolution of topological states, unveiled a narrow surface magnetic gap (2$\Delta_0$ $\simeq$ 8.2 meV)) emerging at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_N$ $\approx$ 16 K). Below $T_N$, two extremely low-energy collective modes, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, with frequencies of $\sim$9.9 and 21.6 GHz at $T$ = 4 K, respectively, were observed, exhibiting strong temperature dependence. $\omega_1$ correlates with an acoustic phonon, while $\omega_2$ is associated with a magnon. The results suggest that EuIn$_2$As$_2$ has the potential to manifest a magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator, presenting a small magnetic energy gap on the (001) surface. The findings further our understanding of the interplay between magnetism and topology in this material, showcasing its potential for applications in quantum information processing and spintronics.

Abstract: We study parametric instability in a magnomechanical system, specifically examining magnon tunneling between moving ferromagnetic insulators. Our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations generate spin currents above a critical velocity threshold, while no spin currents occur below this threshold at low temperatures. The critical velocity depends on magnon stiffness and Zeeman energy. Approaching the threshold, the spin current becomes divergent, linked to the PT-symmetry-breaking transition. This enhanced behavior could offer high-sensitivity measurements and efficient spin current generation in magnon-based quantum technology.

Abstract: Strongly-correlated transition-metal oxides are widely known for their various exotic phenomena. This is exemplified by rare-earth nickelates such as LaNiO$_{3}$, which possess intimate interconnections between their electronic, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. Their properties can be further enhanced by pairing them in hybrid heterostructures, which can lead to hidden phases and emergent phenomena. An important example is the LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ superlattice, where an interlayer electron transfer has been observed from LaTiO$_{3}$ into LaNiO$_{3}$ leading to a high-spin state. However, macroscopic emergence of magnetic order associated with this high-spin state has so far not been observed. Here, by using muon spin rotation, x-ray absorption, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we present direct evidence of an emergent antiferromagnetic order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ interface. As the magnetism is purely interfacial, a single LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ interface can essentially behave as an atomically thin strongly-correlated quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet, potentially allowing its technological utilisation in advanced spintronic devices. Furthermore, its strong quasi-two-dimensional magnetic correlations, orbitally-polarized planar ligand holes, and layered superlattice design make its electronic, magnetic, and lattice configurations resemble the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates, but with an $S \rightarrow 1$ spin state instead.

Abstract: It was recently suggested that proximitized gate-defined Ge hole nanowires could serve as an alternative materials platform for the realization of topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here, we theoretically study the expected experimental signatures of Ge-based MZMs in tunneling conductance measurements, taking into account that unintentional random disorder is unavoidably present in realistic devices. Explicitly, we present numerically calculated local and nonlocal tunneling conductance spectra (as functions of bias voltage and magnetic field) for two different wire lengths, two different disorder models, two different parent superconductors (Al and NbTiN), and various disorder strengths, which we relate to an estimated lower bound for the disorder strength in Ge-based hybrid devices that we extract from the experimentally reported hole mobilities in current state-of-the-art two-dimensional Ge hole gases. We find that even if the actual disorder strength in the Ge-based hybrid device exceeds this theoretical lower bound by an order of magnitude, the system is still in the weak disorder regime, where the topological superconductivity is intact and the local conductance spectra manifest clear end-to-end correlated zero-bias peaks if and only if the system hosts topological end MZMs. This shows that, despite the relatively small pristine topological gaps ($\sim\,$a few tens of $\mu$eV), Ge-based hybrid devices are a promising alternative platform for Majorana experiments due to the extremely high materials quality, which leads to an increased gap-to-disorder ratio and, therefore, to less ambiguity in the experimental tunneling conductance data compared to InAs-based devices.

# Electric, thermal, and thermoelectric magnetoconductivity for Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups induced by the combined effects of topology and strain

Abstract: We continue our investigation of the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations where a three-dimensional Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $, generalizing the considerations of Phys. Rev. B 108 (2023) 155132 and Physica E 159 (2024) 115914. The electromagnetic fields are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other, thus leading to the possibility of having collinear components, which do not arise in a Hall set-up. The net effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $ consists of two parts -- (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $ applied externally; and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the generic expressions for the response tensors, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bandstructures. We elucidate the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the longitudinal and transverse (or Hall) components of the electric, thermal, and thermoelectric response tensors. Especially, for the co-planar transverse components of the response tensors, the OMM part acts exclusively in opposition (sync) with the BC-only part for the Weyl (multi-Weyl) semimetals.

Abstract: Persistent currents (PCs) in mesoscopic rings have been a subject of intense investigation since their proposal by B\"uttiker, Landauer, and Imry in 1983. In this paper, we explore the behavior of PC in spin-orbit coupled rings under the influence of a Zeeman field (without a need for a flux threading the ring), contrasting it with traditional PC observed in rings threaded by magnetic flux. Our study reveals that the emergence of PC in our setup crucially depends on nonzero values of spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman field. Through theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we uncover several intriguing phenomena. Specifically, in ballistic rings, we observe an inverse proportionality between PC and system size, with PC being zero at half filling for even numbers of sites. Additionally, the introduction of on-site disorder leads to the suppression of PC, with exponential decay observed for large disorder strengths and quadratic decay for smaller disorder strengths. Notably, disorder can enhance PC in individual samples, albeit with a configuration-averaged PC of zero. Furthermore, we find that the standard deviation of PC increases with disorder strength, reaching a maximum before decreasing to zero at high disorder strengths. We study the case of PC when the Zeeman field and the spin-orbit field are noncollinear. We also study persistent spin current which shows behavior similar to that of PC except that at half filling, it is not zero. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder in mesoscopic quantum systems, offering new avenues for theoretical exploration and experimental verification.

Abstract: The PICOSEC-Micromegas (PICOSEC-MM) detector is a novel gaseous detector designed for precise timing resolution in experimental measurements. It eliminates time jitter from charged particles in ionization gaps by using extreme UV Cherenkov light emitted in a crystal, detected by a Micromegas photodetector with an appropriate photocathode. The first single-channel prototype tested in 150 GeV/c muon beams achieved a timing resolution below 25 ps, a significant improvement compared to standard Micropattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs). This work explores the specifications for applying these detectors in monitored neutrino beams for the ENUBET Project. Key aspects include exploring resistive technologies, resilient photocathodes, and scalable electronics. New 7-pad resistive detectors are designed to handle the particle flux. In this paper, two potential scenarios are briefly considered: tagging electromagnetic showers with a timing resolution below 30 ps in an electromagnetic calorimeter as well as individual particles (mainly muons) with about 20 ps respectively.

Abstract: The study of van der Waals heterostructures with an interlayer twist, known as "twistronics", has been instrumental in advancing contemporary condensed matter research. Most importantly, it has underpinned the emergence of a multitude of strongly-correlated phases, many of which derive from the topology of the physical system. Here, we explore the application of the twistronics paradigm in plasmonic systems with nontrivial topology, by creating a moir\'e skyrmion superlattice using two superimposed plasmonic skyrmion lattices, twisted at a "magic" angle. The complex electric field distribution of the moir\'e skyrmion superlattice is measured using time-resolved vector microscopy, revealing that each super-cell possesses very large topological invariants and harbors a "skyrmion bag", the size of which is controllable by the twist angle and center of rotation. Our work shows how twistronics leads to a diversity of topological features in optical fields, providing a new route to locally manipulate electromagnetic field distributions, which is crucial for future structured light-matter interaction.

Abstract: Permanent magnet array (PMA) is a popular option to provide the main magnetic field in a dedicated portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system because it does not need power or a cooling system and has a much stronger field strength compared to a resistive magnet. Aside from the popular Halbach array that has a transversal field direction, the Inward-Outward ring (IO ring) array is a promising candidate that offers a longitudinal field direction. In this article, a thorough study of IO ring arrays is conducted by examining the relation between the design parameters and its field patterns, its variants that lead to different applications and their properties. A detailed comparison between an IO ring array and Halbach array was conducted and reported. Moreover, the feasibility of building an IO ring array in a lab is demonstrated. The investigations strongly indicate that IO ring is a promising candidate that can offer high and homogeneous fields or a desired field pattern to portable MRI systems. With a longitudinal field direction, an IO ring array opens up opportunities to adopt MRI advanced technology and techniques in a portable system to improve image quality ans shorten scan time.

Abstract: Quantum phenomena emerging from the interaction of light and matter in low-dimensional systems hold great potential for future quantum technologies. Here, using first-principles calculations incorporating non-local van der Waals interactions and Hubbard corrections, we report simultaneous structural expansion and magnetic collapse in bilayer FeSe induced by photoexcited hot electrons. Our calculations reveal that, while bulk FeSe is paramagnetic, as observed experimentally, double-layer FeSe exhibits robust {\it staggered} antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures with a net site magnetization of $\sim 2.75~\mu_B$/Fe. However, increasing the density of photoexcited electrons systematically enhances the internal electronic entropy, leading to a complete collapse of antiferromagnetic order accompanied by an abrupt expansion of the interlayer separation. Our findings suggest the structural and magnetic properties of FeSe thin films can be finely tuned via ultrafast laser excitation, offering a pathway to control quantum phases in iron-based compounds through electronic temperature.

Abstract: We present simultaneous X-ray and spectral ultraviolet (UV) observations of strikingly-coherent oscillations in emission from a coronal looptop and fan structure, during the impulsive phase of a long-duration M-class solar flare. The 50 s oscillations are observed near in-phase by Solar Orbiter/STIX, GOES, and IRIS Fe XXI intensity, Doppler and non-thermal velocity. For over 5 minutes of their approximate 35 minute duration, the oscillations are so periodic (2-sigma above the power law background), that they are better described as 'periodic pulsations' than the more-widely documented 'quasi-periodic pulsations' often observed during solar flares. By combining time-series analysis of the the multi-instrument datasets with comparison to MHD simulations, we attribute the oscillations to the magnetic tuning fork in the flare looptop-fan region, and betatron acceleration within the lower-altitude flare loops. These interpretations are possible due to the introduced 'Sliding Raster Method' (SliRM) for analysis of slit spectrometer (e.g. IRIS) raster data, to increase the temporal cadence of the observations at the expense of spatial information.

When functioning as a non-volatile memory, the SWCNT FeFETs demonstrated large memory windows of 0.26 V/nm and 0.08 V/nm in the hole and electron conduction regions, respectively, combined with excellent retention behavior for up to 10^4 s. Repeated reconfiguration between p-FET and n-FET modes was also enabled by switching the spontaneous polarization in AlScN and operating the transistor within a voltage range below the coercive voltage. We revealed through circuit simulations that reconfigurable SWCNT transistors can realize ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) with far fewer devices compared to circuits based on silicon CMOS technology or based on resistive non-volatile devices.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance is a prime method for the study of chemical and biological structures and their dynamical processes. The interpretation of these experiments relies on considering the spin of electrons as the sole relevant degree of freedom. By applying ab inito open quantum systems theory to the full electronic wavefunction, here we show that contrary to this widespread framework the thermalization of the unpaired electron spin of two Cr(V) coordination compounds is driven by virtual transitions to excited states with energy higher than 20,000 cm$^{-1}$ instead of solely involving low-energy spin interactions such as Zeeman and hyperfine ones. Moreover, we found that a window of low-energy THz phonons contributes to thermalization, rather than a small number of high-energy vibrations. This work provides a drastic reinterpretation of relaxation in spin-1/2 systems and its chemical control strategies, and ultimately exemplifies the urgency of further advancing an ab initio approach to relaxometry.

Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large spherical radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit has limitations in predicting bandwidth. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n>ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.

Abstract: Pair cascades in polar cap regions of neutron stars are considered to be an essential process in various models of coherent radio emissions of pulsars. The cascades produce pair plasma bunch discharges in quasi-periodic spark events. The cascade properties, and therefore also the coherent radiation, depend strongly on the magnetospheric plasma properties and vary significantly across and along the polar cap. Importantly, where the radio emission emanates from in the polar cap region is still uncertain.
  We investigate the generation of electromagnetic waves by pair cascades and their propagation in the polar cap for three representative inclination angles of a magnetic dipole, $0^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. We use two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations that include quantum-electrodynamic pair cascades in a charge-limited flow from the star surface.
  We find that the discharge properties are strongly dependent on the magnetospheric current profile in the polar cap and that transport channels for high intensity Poynting flux are formed along magnetic field lines where the magnetospheric currents approach zero and where the plasma cannot carry the magnetospheric currents. There, the parallel Poynting flux component is efficiently transported away from the star and may eventually escape the magnetosphere as coherent radio waves. The Poynting flux decreases with increasing distance from the star in regions of high magnetospheric currents.
  Our model shows that no process of energy conversion from particles to waves is necessary for the coherent radio wave emission. Moreover, the pulsar radio beam does not have a cone structure; rather, the radiation generated by the oscillating electric gap fields directly escapes along open magnetic field lines in which no pair creation occurs.

# RNA Binding and Coacervation Promotes Preservation of Peptide Form and Function Across the Heterochiral-Homochiral Divide

## RNA结合和凝聚促进了跨异手性-同手性鸿沟的肽形式和功能的保存

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zfqv5?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Recent evidence suggests that peptide-RNA coacervates may have buffered the emergence of folded domains from flexible peptides. As primitive peptides were likely composed of both L- and D-amino acids, we hypothesized that coacervates may have also supported the emergence of chiral control. To test this hypothesis, we compared the coacervation propensities of an isotactic (homochiral) peptide and a syndiotactic (alternating chirality) peptide, both with an identical sequence derived from the ancient helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the syndiotactic peptide does not form stable dimers with high α-helicity in solution, unlike the isotactic peptide. However, both peptides do coacervate with RNA, albeit with distinct reentrant phase behaviors. Coacervation in each case is facilitated by oligomer formation, likely dimerization, upon RNA binding that promotes RNA cross-linking. Additionally, RNA cross-linking and coacervation of the syndiotactic peptide seems to involve α-helical conformations. We attribute differences in reentrant phase behavior to differences in dimer flexibility and stability that alter the effectiveness of RNA cross-linking. These results illustrate how RNA-binding and/or coacervation by early protein forms could have promoted the transition of flexible, heterochiral peptides into folded, homochiral domains.

# Bioactive Metabolites from Aspergillus niger Associated with Moringa oleifera: Potential for Anti-Infective Agents

## 与辣根相关的黑曲霉生物活性代谢产物: 抗感染药物的潜力

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5322575/latest

This study explores the metabolic profiling of secondary metabolites from the endophytic fungus Aspergillus niger associated with the medicinal plant Moringa oleifera for the discovery of anti-infective agents. Aspergillus niger was isolated and characterised based on morphological traits and molecular phylogenetic analysis, confirmed via nucleotide sequence comparison with sequences on the NCBI database. The effects of cultivation parameters &ndash; including medium composition, volume, extraction solvent, and cultivation duration &ndash; on metabolite recovery and biological activity were evaluated. Bioassays identified active extracts, which were further fractionated and purified using chromatographic techniques. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were employed to analyse the isolated metabolites. The results demonstrated that cultivation conditions significantly influenced metabolite production and extract recovery. The study revealed notable antibacterial and antifungal activities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans among others, although no significant anti-leishmanial, antioxidant, or anti-inflammatory effects were observed. Metabolites identified include fumaric acid, succinic acid, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenol, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]acetamide. Notably, this study marks the first report of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenol and N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]acetamide as isolated from Aspergillus niger. These findings highlight Aspergillus niger as a promising source of bioactive metabolites and provide valuable insights into its potential for the development of novel anti-infective agents.

# Heat and Mass Transfer in Ternary Nanofluids Flowing Over a Stretching Sheet in Porous Media: Effects of Thermal Buoyancy and Magnetic Fields

## 在多孔介质中拉伸片上流动的三元纳米流体中的传热和传质: 热浮力和磁场的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5324735/latest

The effects of mass and heat transport in ternary nanofluids flowing across a stretching sheet through porous media are examined in this paper. Using convective boundary conditions, the analysis focused on incorporating the thermal buoyancy, magnetic field, thermal radiation, ananofluid comprises water-based Cu, Al2O3, and Ag nanoparticles. Using the appropriate transformations, the governing PDEs are transformed into nonlinear ODEs. It employs similarity transformations to convert governing partial differential equations into nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which are numerically solved using the bvp4c solver in MATLAB. This study offers a comparative analysis involving ternary (Cu&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;Al2O3&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;Ag), binary (Cu&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;Al2O3) and monophasic (Cu) nanoparticle configurations suspended in water (H2O). The results revealed that the greater the dissipation coefficient (Ec) was, the greater the velocity and temperature and the lower the nanoconcentration. The surface drag, Nu and Sh decrease with increasing Ec. The lower the molecular diffusivity is, the lower the velocity, temperature, and concentration. This innovative study exploring the effects of heat and mass transfer in ternary nanofluids flowing through a porous medium over a stretching sheet has significant potential for application in various fields, such as biomedical engineering and renewable energy technologies, to increase the performance of solar collectors and geothermal systems through the improved heat transfer capabilities of nanofluids.

# Variation of Total Electron Content During a Severe Geomagnetic Storm of 23-24 April 2023

## 2023年4月24日严重地磁风暴期间总电子含量的变化

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5332574/latest

In this paper, we study the geomagnetic storm that occurred on April 23&amp;ndash;24, 2023. We present variations in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF-Bz), solar wind parameters (Vsw, Nsw, Tsw, and Psw), geomagnetic index (SYM-H), and vertical total electron content (VTEC) derived from 18 GPS-TEC stations situated in equatorial, mid-latitude, and high-latitude regions. We analyze the Total Electron Content (TEC) variations before, during, and after the storm using VTEC plots, dTEC% plots, and global ionospheric maps for each GNSS receiver station, all referenced to Universal Time (UT). Our results indicate that GNSS receiver stations located at high latitudes exhibited an increase in ionospheric density structures during the main phase and a decrease during the recovery phase. In contrast, stations in equatorial and mid-latitude regions showed a decrease in ionospheric density during the main phase and an increase during the recovery phase. Large dTEC% values ranging from &amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;80 to 190 TECU were observed a few hours before and during the storm period (April 23&amp;ndash;24, 2023), compared to values ranging from &amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;10 to 20 TECU on the day before (April 22, 2023) and the day after (April 25, 2023). Notably, higher dTEC% values were observed at stations in high and mid-latitudes compared to those in the equatorial region. As the storm progressed, the TEC intensification observed on global ionospheric maps appeared to shift from east to west. A detailed analysis of these maps showed that equatorial and low-latitude regions experienced the highest spatial and temporal TEC variations during the storm period compared to higher latitude regions.

# An approach to create soft X-ray virtual arrays in tomography reconstruction considering non-rigid rotation of the plasma column in the tokamak

## 考虑托卡马克中等离子体柱的非刚性旋转，在断层重建中创建软x射线虚拟阵列的方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5335201/latest

A method was proposed to create Soft X-ray virtual arrays in tomography to study the rigid versus non-rigid rotation of the plasma column in a tokamak. The coordinate reference of the tokamak was transformed into the rotating plasma frame to generate virtual arrays. Data from physical arrays at time t2 were replaced by virtual arrays at time t1 to compare physical and virtual tomography images, thereby investigating the nature of the rotations. Three physical arrays were selected on both the low and high toroidal magnetic field sides and replaced by virtual arrays at time t2. The optimized angle  was calculated by minimizing the differences between the tomography images and the reference image for each virtual array. A function based on the toroidal magnetic field profile was defined to determine the position of the virtual arrays. Results indicated differing rotation angles during the virtualization process due to the non-rigid rotation of the plasma column. The position angles for each island varied from the reference island during tomography reconstruction, both when adding and replacing virtual arrays. These differences were smaller under the assumptions of non-rigid rotation, enhancing the accuracy and validity of the tomography reconstruction.

# Age-Related Changes in Brain Network Modularity Based on the Dynamic Sliding Window Subnetwork Voting Method

## 基于动态滑动窗口子网投票法的脑网络模块性年龄变化

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5319487/latest

An understanding of the modular structure of brain functional networks and their changes with age is beneficial in uncovering the neural mechanisms that underlie cognitive decline during the ageing process. Compared to simpler networks, such as social networks, the execution of brain functions always depends on extensive interactions among multiple brain regions, which complicates the detection of accurate, stable, and physiologically meaningful community structures. However, although previous work has focused on the modular organization of the brain, there has been insufficient research on its specific dynamic changes and how these evolve with age. In this case, this paper investigates the modular structure of human brain functional networks and their dynamic changes across different age groups, revealing the impact of aging on brain network functionality. Firstly, we constructed brain networks using a dynamic sliding window subnetwork voting method. Further, this paper, based on public datasets and the Girvan-Newman (GN) community detection algorithm, effectively divided the community structure of brain networks and calculated modularity. It focused on analyzing the brain network characteristics of 439 participants under resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The results of the variance analysis indicate significant differences in modularity across different age groups. The brain networks of younger participants exhibited pronounced modular characteristics and higher efficiency in information processing. In contrast, older participants displayed a significant reduction in modularity, reflecting a trend towards functional integration. These changes are closely related to the decline in cognitive abilities and the degeneration of neural connections.
