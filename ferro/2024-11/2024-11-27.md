# Thermal Hall response of an abelian chiral spin liquid at finite temperatures

## 阿白手性自旋液体在有限温度下的热霍尔响应

arXiv:2411.15304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal Hall transport has emerged as a valuable tool for probing the fractionalized excitations in chiral quantum spin liquids. Observing quantized thermal Hall response, expected at temperatures below the spectral gap, has been challenging and controversial. The finite temperature behavior, especially in the quantum critical regime above the spectral gap, can provide useful signatures of the underlying topological order. In this context, we study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a kagome lattice that is believed to be a U$(1)$ Dirac spin liquid over a wide intermediate energy range. Scalar spin chirality perturbations turn this into a gapped abelian chiral spin liquid (CSL) with semionic topological order. Using a recently developed large-$N$ technique [Guo et al., Phys. Rev. B 101, 195126 (2020)], we obtain explicit expressions for the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ at finite temperatures taking into account both matter and gauge fluctuations. At low temperatures below the spectral gap, the quantized thermal Hall response agrees with that expected from conformal field theory and gravitational anomaly arguments. Our main finding is that in a large temperature window spanning the spectral gap and the Curie temperature scales where quantum critical fluctuations dominate, $\kappa_{xy}/T$ obeys a power-law with logarithmic corrections. Our analysis also provides a route to understanding the thermal Hall response at temperatures in the quantum critical regime of other spin liquid phases.

# 3-Dimensional Model Based Iterative Reconstruction of Magnetisation in a Nanowire Structure Using Holographic Vector Field Electron Tomography Measurements

## 使用全息矢量场电子层析成像测量基于三维模型的纳米线结构中磁化的迭代重建

arXiv:2411.15323v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for characterisation of 3D magnetic spin structures are necessary to advance the performance of 3D magnetic nanoscale technologies. However, as the component dimensions approach the nanometre range, it becomes more challenging to analyse 3D magnetic configurations with the appropriate spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a method based on Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in which model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) is used to reconstruct the most probable magnetisation in an exemplar nanostructure. This method is based on relating electron phase measurements to the magnetic configuration of the nanostructure, and therefore, the method is subject to certain limitations. In this proof-of-concept experiment, MBIR was tested on an L-shaped ferromagnetic cobalt nanowire, fabricated using focused electron beam induced deposition. Off-axis electron holography was used to acquire a tomographic tilt series of electron holograms, which were analysed to measure magnetic electron phase shift over two tilt arcs with up to $ \pm 60$ degree tilt range. Then, a 3D magnetisation vector field consistent with the tomographic phase measurements was reconstructed, revealing multiple magnetic domains within the nanowire. The reconstructed magnetisation is accurate for magnetic domains larger than 50 nm, and higher resolution can be achieved by the continued development of tomographic reconstruction algorithms.

# Unconventional gapping behavior in a kagome superconductor

## kagome超导体中的非常规间隙行为

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15333

arXiv:2411.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the types of superconducting order in quantum materials is a challenge, especially when multiple degrees of freedom, such as bands or orbitals, contribute to the fermiology and when superconductivity competes, intertwines, or coexists with other symmetry-breaking orders. Here, we study the Kagome-lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5, in which multiband superconductivity coexists with a charge order that substantially reduces the compound's space group symmetries. Through a combination of thermodynamic as well as electrical and thermal transport measurements, we uncover two superconducting regimes with distinct transport and thermodynamic characteristics, while finding no evidence for a phase transition separating them. Thermodynamic measurements reveal substantial quasiparticle weight in a high-temperature regime. At lower temperatures, this weight is removed via the formation of a second gap. The two regimes are sharply distinguished by a pronounced enhancement of the upper critical field at low temperatures and by a switch in the anisotropy of the longitudinal thermal conductivity as a function of in-plane magnetic field orientation. We argue that the band with a gap opening at lower temperatures continues to host low-energy quasiparticles, possibly due to a nodal structure of the gap. Taken together, our results present evidence for band-selective superconductivity with remarkable decoupling of the (two) superconducting gaps. The commonly employed multiband scenario, whereby superconductivity emerges in a primary band and is then induced in other bands appears to fail in this unconventional kagome superconductor. Instead, band-selective superconducting pairing is a paradigm that seems to unify seemingly contradicting results in this intensely studied family of materials and beyond.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic ground state of single crystals of the ruthenium-dimer-based hexagonal perovskite Ba$_{3}$ZnRu$_{2}$O$_{9}$ using magnetic susceptibility and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements. While a previous study on powder samples exhibited intriguing magnetic behavior, questions about whether the spin state within a Ru$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimer is a conventional $S = 3/2$ dimer or an orbital-selective $S = 1$ dimer were raised. The RIXS spectra reveal magnetic excitations from Hund's intraionic multiplet and intradimer spin-triplet transitions. The observed transition energies of the Hund's intraionic multiplets align with the $S=3/2$ ground state, contrasting with the theoretically proposed orbital-selective $S=1$ dimer state. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility analysis confirms the realization of the spin $S=3/2$ dimer state, and the extracted intradimer coupling is consistent with the spin-triplet transition energy observed in the RIXS spectra. These results highlights the ability of "spectroscopic fingerprinting" by RIXS to determine the magnetic ground states of complex materials.

Abstract: Complex ferromagnetic oxides such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) offer a pathway for creating energy efficient spintronic devices with new functionalities. LSMO exhibits high-temperature ferromagnetism, half metallicity, sharp resonance linewidth, low damping and a large anisotropic magnetoresistance response. Combined with Pt, a proven material with high spin-charge conversion efficiency, LSMO can potentially be used to create robust nano-oscillators. Here, we employed the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and spin-pumping FMR measurements to investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin transport in NdGaO3(110)/LSMO(15 nm)/Pt(0 and 5 nm) thin films at temperatures ranging from 300K to 90K. We find that the bilayer system exhibits a low magnetic damping (0.002), small linewidth (12Oe) and a large spin Hall angle ( 3.2%) at 170K, making it the optimum working temperature for spin orbit torque oscillators based on this system.

# Possibility of BCS-BEC crossover in $\kappa$-type organic superconductors

## $ \ kappa $ 型有机超导体中bcs-bec交叉的可能性

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15510

arXiv:2411.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of BCS-BEC crossover in superconductors, which smoothly connects Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory with Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in fermion systems, is an intriguing recent topic in strongly correlated electron systems. The organic superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$ ($\kappa$-HgBr) under pressure is one of the leading candidates, owing to its unique metallic spin-liquid nature and tunable electron correlation. We theoretically investigate the extended Hubbard model for $\kappa$-HgBr and discuss the possibility of the BCS-BEC crossover by systematically calculating superconducting correlation function, coherence length, superfluid weight, and chemical potential. Our findings show that the BCS-BEC crossover can be observed when competing phases, such as Mott insulators and charge and/or spin orders, are suppressed by appropriate hole doping. $\kappa$-HgBr is just the case because both the Mott insulating phase and magnetic orders are absent due to its nonstoichiometric Hg composition and geometrical frustration. We further propose that other $\kappa$-type organic superconductors could serve as potential candidates of the BCS-BEC crossover if their band fillings are systematically tuned.

# Itinerant electron metamagnetism for lattices with van Hove density-of-states singularities near the Fermi level

Abstract: Itinerant-electron metamagnetism is investigated within the Hubbard model for various lattices having van Hove singularities (vHS) in the electronic spectrum: face-centered cubic and orthorhombic lattices. The remarkable itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition occurs provided that the Fermi level is in the region with a strong positive curvature of the density of electron states typically positioned between two close van Hove singularities. Orthorhombic distortion of tetragonal lattice is a promising mechanism for generating two closely split vHS with strong density-of-states curvature between them. A phase diagram in terms of electron filling and Hubbard interaction parameter is presented, which shows the paramagnetic-metamagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition and regions of saturated and non-saturated magnetism. The standard Landau theory expansion based on electron density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level is demonstrated to be insufficient to describe the whole magnetic phase diagram including the itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition.

Abstract: As a special material symmetry operation, crystal twins usually influence physical properties. Here, detailed electrical transport and magnetic measurements were performed to reveal twinning effect on properties of van der Waals ferromagnet FePd$_2$Te$_2$. Orthorhombic crystal domains were observed in polarized optical microscopy and fixed $\pi$/2 angle between adjacent domains suggests a phase transition origin of the twins. FePd$_2$Te$_2$ exhibits fourfold in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance. It is attributed to antiferromagnetic coupling component near atomically flat twin boundary and pseudo four-fold symmetry from perpendicular Fe chains. Intense magnetic domain motion is suggested by Hopkinson effect observed in magnetic susceptibility. A set of unusual critical exponents $\beta$ = 0.866, $\gamma$ = 1.043, $\delta$ = 2.20 cannot be classified in any universal class predicted by renormalized group. Deviation from standard model reflects the non-saturating magnetization and slow growth of spontaneous magnetization resulting from crystal domain walls. These results show that additional symmetry from twins and twin boundary have a significant effect on electrical transport and magnetic properties of FePd$_2$Te$_2$. There is much room to modulate physical properties of twinned van der Waals ferromagnets through twins.

arXiv:2411.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Josephson Junctions (MJJs) are a special class of hybrid systems where antagonistic correlations coexist, thus providing a key for advances in weak superconductivity, superconducting spintronics and quantum computation. So far, the memory properties of MJJs have been mostly investigated in view of digital electronics and for spintronic devices at liquid-helium temperature. At the operating temperature of quantum circuits, a magnetic order can rise in a Superconductor (S) at the S/Ferromagnet (F) interface, i.e., the inverse proximity effect (IPE), thus leading to a significant modification of the magnetic field patterns in MJJs. In this work, we have carried out a comparative investigation of the magnetic behavior of tunnel MJJs with a strong ferromagnetic layer inserted in the layout of both Nb and Al JJs, respectively. The comparative analysis validates the crucial role of the temperature, the fundamental scaling energies of S/F coupling systems, and the transparency of the S/F interface. This investigation points out that the IPE is a key aspect to consider when designing tunnel MJJs operating well below 4 K and thus in the perspective of hybrid superconducting quantum architectures.

arXiv:2411.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of magnetization resonant control in a Josephson superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor $\varphi_{0}$ junction shunted by an $LC$ circuit is demonstrated. As a result of the resonance of Josephson oscillations with oscillations in the circuit, a time-independent superconducting current arises in the junction. Due to the coupling of the Josephson phase and the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer, the resulting superconducting current leads to a deviation of the easy axis from its initial position and to a precession of the magnetization around the tilted axis. We show that the tilt value increases with the increasing spin-orbit interaction and the Josephson to magnetic energy ratio. An analytical expression for the magnetization tilt is obtained, which agrees well with the results of numerical calculations. The emerging possibility of resonant control of magnetization in a shunted $\varphi_{0}$ junction can be used in the development of novel technologies in the field of superconducting electronics and spintronics.

Abstract: Antiferroelectrics, which host both polar and antipolar order parameters, are characterized by the double hysteresis loops which are advantageous for various applications such as high-density energy storage. In this study, we investigate the coupling between oxygen octahedral rotations and polarization in well-known perovskites, with a focus on SrTiO$_3$. Using first-principles calculations and symmetry-adapted Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, we construct an energy landscape to analyze how this coupling shapes polarization-voltage hysteresis behavior. We show that tuning the relative strength of polar and rotational instabilities by exploiting epitaxial strain and layering leads to nontrivial hysteresis behavior. Consequently, the rotation coupling with polarization leads to an expanded search space of materials exhibiting antiferroelectric-like double hysteresis.

# Electronic Trap Detection with Carrier-Resolved Photo-Hall Effect

## 具有载流子分辨光霍尔效应的电子陷阱检测

arXiv:2411.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic trap states are a critical yet unavoidable aspect of semiconductor devices, impacting performance of various electronic devices such as transistors, memory devices, solar cells, and LEDs. The density, energy level, and position of these trap states often enable or constrain device functionality, making their measurement crucial in materials science and device fabrication. Most methods for measuring trap states involve fabricating a junction, which can inadvertently introduce or alter traps, highlighting the need for alternative, less-invasive techniques. Here, we present a unique photo-Hall-based method to detect and characterize trap density and energy level while concurrently extracting key carrier properties, including mobility, photocarrier density, recombination lifetime, and diffusion length. This technique relies on analyzing the photo-Hall data in terms of "photo-Hall conductivity" vs. electrical conductivity under varying light intensities and temperatures. We show that the photo-Hall effect, in the presence of traps, follows an $\textit{astonishingly simple}$ relationship - $\textit{a hyperbola equation}$ - that reveals detailed insights into charge transport and trap occupation. We have successfully applied this technique to P and N-type silicon as a benchmark and to high-performance halide perovskite photovoltaic films. This technique substantially expands the capability of Hall effect-based measurements by integrating the effects of the four most common excitations in nature - electric field, magnetic field, photon, and phonon in solids - into a single equation and enabling unparalleled extraction of charge carrier and trap properties in semiconductors.

# Control of ferromagnetism of Vanadium Oxide thin films by oxidation states

arXiv:2411.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium oxide (VOx) is a material of significant interest due to its metal-insulator transition (MIT) properties as well as its diverse stable antiferromagnetism depending on the valence states of V and O with distinct MIT transitions and N\'eel temperatures. Although several studies reported the ferromagnetism in the VOx, it was mostly associated with impurities or defects, and pure VOx has rarely been reported as ferromagnetic. Our research presents clear evidence of ferromagnetism in the VOx thin films, exhibiting a saturation magnetization of approximately 14 kA/m at 300 K. We fabricated 20-nm thick VOx thin films via reactive sputtering from a metallic vanadium target in various oxygen atmosphere. The oxidation states of ferromagnetic VOx films show an ill-defined stoichiometry of V2O3+p, where p = 0.05, 0.23, 0.49, with predominantly disordered microstructures. Ferromagnetic nature of these VOx films is confirmed through a strong antiferromagnetic exchange coupling with the neighboring ferromagnetic layer in the VOx/Co bilayers, in which the spin configurations of Co layer is influenced strongly due to the additional anisotropy introduced by VOx layer. The present study highlights the potential of VOx as an emerging functional magnetic material with tunability by oxidation states for modern spintronic applications.

Abstract: Recently, time-reversal symmetry broken magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have attracted extensive attention and have provided an intriguing platform for exploring fundamental physical phenomena. The study of chromium telluride-based systems has also drawn significant interest towards spintronics applications owing to their high Curie temperatures. Here, using \textit{ab initio} calculations, we propose the emergence of multiple Weyl points (WPs) near the Fermi level in such an intrinsic ferromagnetic system, Cr$_3$Te$_4$. The large, well-separated, nontrivial Fermi arcs and surface states, suggest that the WPs are highly robust and resilient to perturbations. A substantial Berry curvature contribution in the vicinity of the Fermi energy not only serves as the origin of large conventional anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), but also produces unconventional parallel AHC in this material, owing to the low structural symmetry. In addition to the charge Hall conductivity, we also find significant anomalous Nernst conductivities originating from the Berry curvature. Alongside our theoretical predictions, we present complementary experimental results, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and an examination of the magnetic properties, which demonstrate a Curie temperature of 327 K. Our study advances the understanding of magnetic WSMs, and also encourages further studies in the context of topological properties of our proposed material.

# Typical altermagnetism with huge nonrelativistic spin-split and flat band in the bulk CoF$_2$

## 具有巨大非相对论自旋分裂和平带的典型地磁

arXiv:2411.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a third phase named altermagnet, has been introduced to describe a special magnetic state and some materials are classified as altermagnets. Here, our first principles calculations indicate that the bulk CoF$_2$ is an altermagnet with a huge spin-split and flat bands near the Fermi energy. By comparing the results with and without spin-orbit coupling, it can be shown that the huge spin splitting is not caused by relativistic effects but rather by a special symmetry. There are also flat bands near the Fermi energy which can be adjusted by changing the direction of the magnetic moment. From the band structure, we obtain a spin-resolved effective low-energy model that describes a quasi-two-dimensional hole gas with two independent spin components, leading to exotic transport phenomena that are distinct from those in conventional two-dimensional or bulk materials. Therefore, the bulk CoF$_2$ is a typical altermagnet with a huge nonrelativistic spin-split and flat bands which deserves further study for the potential spintronics and electronics applications.

# ToMSGKpoint: A user-friendly package for computing symmetry transformation properties of electronic eigenstates of nonmagnetic and magnetic crystalline materials

## ToMSGKpoint: 一个用户友好的软件包，用于计算非磁性和磁性晶体材料的电子本征态的对称变换特性

Abstract: The calculation of (co)irreducible representations of energy bands at high-symmetry points (HSPs) is essential for high-throughput research on topological materials based on symmetry-indicators or topological quantum chemistry. However, existing computational packages usually require transforming crystal structures into specific conventions, thus hindering extensive application, especially to materials whose symmetries are yet to be identified. To address this issue, we developed a Mathematica package, \texttt{ToMSGKpoint}, capable of determining the little groups and (co)irreducible representations of little groups of HSPs, high-symmetry lines (HSLs), and high-symmetry planes (HSPLs) for any nonmagnetic and magnetic crystalline materials in two and three dimensions, with or without considering spin-orbit coupling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first package to achieve such functionality. The package also provides magnetic space group operations, supports the analysis of (co)irreducible representations of energy bands at HSPs, HSLs, and HSPLs using electronic wavefunctions obtained from \textit{ab initio} calculations interfaced with VASP. Designed for user convenience, the package generates results in a few simple steps and presents all relevant information in clear tabular format. Its versatility is demonstrated through applications to nonmagnetic topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi, as well as the antiferromagnetic topological material MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Suitable for any crystal structure, this package can be conveniently applied in a streamlined study once magnetic space group varies with various symmetry-breakings caused by phase transitions.

# Charge-induced energy shift of a single-spin qubit under a magnetic-field gradient

## 磁场梯度下单自旋量子位的电荷诱导能量位移

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16224

arXiv:2411.16224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electron confined by a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) can be displaced by changes in electron occupations of surrounding QDs owing to the Coulomb interaction. For a single-spin qubit in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, such a displacement of the host electron results in a qubit energy shift which must be handled carefully for high-fidelity operations. Here we spectroscopically investigate the qubit energy shift induced by changes in charge occupations of nearby QDs for a silicon single-spin qubit in a magnetic-field gradient. Between two different charge configurations of an adjacent double QD, a spin qubit shows an energy shift of about 4 MHz, which necessitates strict management of electron positions over a QD array. We confirm a correlation between the qubit frequency and the charge configuration by using a postselection analysis.

# Temperature Control of Spin-Wave Spectra in Continuously Graded Epitaxial Pd-Fe Alloy Films

## 连续梯度外延pd-fe合金薄膜中自旋波谱的温度控制

arXiv:2411.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuously graded ferromagnetic thin films represent a new class of magnonic materials, where a spin-wave resonance spectrum can be tuned in resonance frequencies/fields, number of modes and even dispersion law by the magnetic properties profiling across the film thickness. In the paper, we demonstrate that temperature is another degree of freedom controlling the spin-wave spectra in graded magnetic materials. We show that temperature affects the spectrum not only in a trivial way via the temperature dependence of magnetization and related quantities, but rather through modification of magnetic structure of a film due to the Curie temperature being crossed by fractions of its thickness. The profile that is continuous at lower temperatures may become discontinuous at higher temperatures. To demonstrate this, four 200-nm thick vertically graded epitaxial Pd1-xFex films were synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy technique, in particular, two with the linear (2-10 at.% and 12-18 at.% range of the iron content), one with the sine and one with the cosine (both with the 2-10 at.% range of the iron content) distribution profiles. The resonance spectra of standing spin waves were studied by the cavity ferromagnetic resonance at 9.4 GHz in the temperature range of 20-300 K. Versatile spin-wave excitation patterns were obtained, and drastic evolution of their excitation energies, and number of modes with temperature was observed. Based on the modeling, temperature dependences of the spin-wave stiffness D and magnitudes of the interface $\alpha_{inter}$ and surface $\alpha_{surf}$ pinning constants were obtained. Our study shows that in addition to a continuous grading of magnetic properties of thin films, temperature provides another powerful and well elaborated tool for modifying the magnetic grading profile and thus, flexile tuning the spectrum of spin-wave excitations.

# Spin-dependent photovoltage in graphene/MoS2-based field-effect transistors

arXiv:2411.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that Terahertz sensors can effectively detect the spin resonances of Dirac fermions in graphene. The associated photovoltaic measurement technique allows for the investigation of the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in graphene as well as its topological properties from microwave to Terahertz frequencies. In this work, using graphene/MoS2-based Field-Effect Transistors, we observed a magnetic resonance photovoltage signal in the Gigahertz range that is independent of the gate bias. The dispersion of the associated spin-flip transitions remains intriguingly unaffected by the MoS2 layer. In parallel, the spin-related signal consistently appears as a drop in photovoltage, regardless of the signal's polarity or origin, whether it arises from plasma wave rectification or thermoelectric effects. This behavior is interpreted as a decrease in the system's spin polarization due to spin-dependent recombination or scattering of photocarriers. Understanding the various photovoltaic signals in highly sensitive Gigahertz/Terahertz sensors paves the way for exploring spin-dependent mechanisms in two-dimensional quantum materials, influenced by proximity effects such as spin-orbit coupling, topology, and magnetism.

# Origin of the transitions inversion in rare-earth vanadates

## 稀土钒酸盐转变反转的起源

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16351

arXiv:2411.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surprising inversion of the orbital- and magnetic-order transition temperatures in the RVO3 series with increasing the rare-earth radius makes the series unique among orbitally-ordered materials. Here, augmenting dynamical mean-field theory with a decomposition of the order parameter into irreducible tensors, we show that this anomalous behavior emerges from an unusual hierarchy of interactions. First, increasing the rare-earth radius, orbital physics comes to be controlled by xz-xz quadrupolar super-exchange rather than by lattice distortion. Next, for antiferromagnetic spin order, orbital super-exchange terms with different spin rank compete, so that the dipolar spin-spin interaction dominates. Eventually, G-type magnetic order (anti-ferro in all directions) can appear already above the orbital ordering transition, and C-type order (anti-ferro in the ab plane) right around it. The strict constraints we found explain why the inversion is rare, giving at the same time criteria to look for similar behavior in other materials.

# Bosonic Peierls state emerging from the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo interaction

## 从一维Ising-Kondo相互作用中出现的Bosonic Peierls状态

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16357

arXiv:2411.16357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important effect induced by the particle-lattice interaction, the Peierls transition, a hot topic in condensed matter physics, is usually believed to occur in the one-dimensional fermionic systems. We here study a bosonic version of the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo lattice model, which describes itinerant bosons interact with the localized magnetic moments via only longitudinal Kondo exchange.\ We show that, by means of perturbation analysis and numerical density-matrix renormalization group method, a bosonic analog of the Peierls state can occur in proper parameters regimes. The Peierls state here is characterized by the formation of a long-range spin-density-wave order, the periodicity of which is set by the density of the itinerant bosons. The ground-state phase diagram is mapped out by extrapolating the finite-size results to thermodynamic limit. Apart from the bosonic Peierls state, we also reveal the presence of some other magnetic orders, including a paramagnetic phase and a ferromagnetic phase. We finally propose a possible experimental scheme with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Our results broaden the frontiers of the current understanding of the one-dimensional particle-lattice interaction system.

# Highly Efficient Non-relativistic Edelstein effect in p-wave magnets

## p波磁体中的高效非相对论Edelstein效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16378

arXiv:2411.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion, known as the Edelstein effect (EE), has been typically linked to spin-orbit coupling mechanisms, which require materials with heavy elements within a non-centrosymmetric environment. Here we demonstrate that the high efficiency of spin-charge conversion can be achieved even without spin-orbit coupling in the recently identified coplanar p-wave magnets. The non-relativistic Edelstein effect (NREE) in these magnets exhibits a distinct phenomenology compared to the relativistic EE, characterized by a strongly anisotropic response and an out-of-plane polarized spin density resulting from the spin symmetries. We illustrate the NREE through minimal tight-binding models, allowing a direct comparison to different systems. Through first-principles calculations, we further identify the p-wave candidate material CeNiAsO as a high-efficiency NREE material, revealing a 25 times larger response than the maximally achieved relativistic EE and other reported NREE in non-collinear magnetic systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. This highlights the potential for efficient spin-charge conversion in p-wave magnetic systems.

Abstract: Skyrmions are stable topological textures that have garnered substantial attention within the ferroelectric community for their exotic functional properties. While previous studies have questioned the feasibility of [001]$_{\text{pc}}$ skyrmion tubes in rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ due to the high energy cost of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, we demonstrate here their stabilization with topological charges of $\mathcal{Q} = \pm 1$ from density functional theory and second-principles calculations. By enabling extensive vortex and antivortex polarization configurations, we overcome the expected prohibitive energetic barriers while preserving the topological nature of the structures. Notably, we extend these findings to demonstrate the appearance of skyrmion and antiskyrmion tubes in other related materials, highlighting their broader relevance. Furthermore, our computational experiments indicate that these structures can be directly stabilized and reversibly switched by applied electric fields, establishing a straightforward route for their practical realization and functional control in nanoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy at low temperatures and high magnetic fields has been performed on a noncentrosymmetric La$_3$Se$_4$ superconductor with a critical temperature $T_c$ = 8 K. Two superconducting energy gaps $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ with $2\Delta_{1}/k_{B} T_{c}$ ~ 5.8 and $2\Delta_{2}/k_{B} T_{c}$ ~ 2.3, are directly observed in some of the spectra. The temperature and magnetic field effects help to resolve a two-gap structure even on the most frequent spectra where at low temperatures only a single gap is apparent, reflected in a pair of maxima around the zero bias. Two-gap superconductivity consistently with the point contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy is also supported by the heat capacity and the Hall probe magnetization measurements.

arXiv:2411.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) layered ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 shows great potential in two-dimensional spintronic application due to its robust room-temperature ferromagnetism and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Despite the tremendous progress in the spintronic and electronic studies of Fe3GaTe2, much less effort has been spent on the understanding of lattice dynamics and its possible interaction with spintronic and electronic degrees of freedom in Fe3GaTe2. In this work, by combining Raman spectroscopic data in a wide range of pressure (atmospheric pressure~19.5 GPa) and temperature (80 K~690 K) with first-principles calculation results, we systematically studied the lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of Fe3GaTe2. Our results show that the phonon energies of Fe3GaTe2 located at 126.0 cm-1 and 143.5 cm-1 originate from the E_2g^2 and A_1g^1 vibration modes, respectively, and the nature of the E_2g^2 mode is anharmonic while that of the A_1g^1 mode is quasi-harmonic. Furthermore, the spin-phonon coupling in Fe3GaTe2 is discovered by identifying the anomalies in the Raman data right below the Curie temperature of 360 K, in which the phonon energies and the full widths at half maximum of the E_2g^2 mode clearly deviate from the classical anharmonic model. Our findings are valuable for fundamental studies and potential applications of vdW Fe3GaTe2-based materials and devices under variable temperature and pressure conditions.

# Emerging new phases in correlated Mott insulator Ca2RuO4

arXiv:2411.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mott insulator Ca2RuO4 is a paradigmatic example among transition metal oxides, where the interplay of charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom leads to competing quantum phases. In this paper, we focus on and review some key aspects, from the underlying physical framework and its basic properties, to recent theoretical efforts that aim to trigger unconventional quantum ground states, using several external parameters and stimuli. Using first-principle calculations, we demonstrate that Ca2RuO4 shows a spin splitting in the reciprocal space, and identify it as an altermagnetic candidate material. The non relativistic spin-splitting has an orbital selective nature, dictated by the local crystallographic symmetry. Next, we consider two routes that may trigger exotic quantum states. The first one corresponds to transition metal substitution of the 4d4 Ru with isovalent 3d3 ions. This substitutional doping may alter the spin-orbital correlations favoring the emergence of negative thermal expansion. The second route explores fledgling states arising in a nonequilibrium steady state under the influence of an applied electric field. We show that the electric field can directly affect the orbital density, eventually leading to strong orbital fluctuations and the suppression of orbital imbalance, which may, in turn, reduce antiferromagnetism. These aspects suggest possible practical applications, as its unique properties may open up possibilities for augmenting existing technologies, surpassing the limitations of conventional materials.

Abstract: In this paper we showcase the strengths of polarized neutron imaging as a magnetic imaging technique through a case study on field-cooled multifilamentary YBCO tape carrying a transport current while containing a trapped magnetic field. The measurements were done at J-PARC's RADEN beamline, measuring a radiograph of a single polarization component, to showcase the analysis potential with minimal acquisition time.
  Regions of internal damage are easily and accurately identified as the technique probes the internal magnetic field of the sample, thereby avoiding surface-smearing effects. Quantitative measurements of the integrated field strength in various regions are acquired using time-of-flight information. Finally, we estimate the strength of the screening currents in the superconductor during the experiment by simulating an experiment with a model sample and comparing it to the experimental data. With this, we show that polarized neutron imaging is not only a useful tool for investigating magnetic structures but also for investigating samples carrying currents.

# Unusual Coulomb phase physics in the arctic square ice

## 北极广场冰中异常的库仑相物理学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16526

arXiv:2411.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square ice is a two-dimensional spin liquid hosting a Coulomb phase physics. When constrained under specific boundary conditions, the so-called domain-wall boundary conditions, a phase separation occurs that leads to the formation of a spin liquid confined within a disk surrounded by magnetically ordered regions. Here, we numerically characterize the ground-state properties of this spin liquid, coined the arctic square ice in reference to a phenomenon known in statistical mechanics. Our results reveal that both the vertex distributions and the magnetic correlations are inhomogeneous within the liquid region, and they exhibit a radial dependence. If these properties resemble those of the conventional square ice close to the center of the disk, they evolve continuously as the disk perimeter is approached. There, the spin liquid orders. As a result, pinch points, signaling the presence of algebraic spin correlations, coexist with magnetic Bragg peaks in the magnetic structure factor computed within the disk. The arctic square ice thus appears as an unconventional Coulomb phase sharing common features with a fragmented spin liquid, albeit on a charge-neutral vacuum.

# Measuring entanglement without local addressing via spiral quantum state tomography

arXiv:2411.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography serves as a key tool for identifying quantum states generated in quantum computers and simulators, typically involving local operations on individual particles or qubits to enable measurements in various bases. However, this approach requires an exponentially larger number of measurement setups as quantum platforms grow in size, highlighting the necessity of more scalable methods to efficiently perform quantum state estimation. Here, we present a tomography scheme that scales far more efficiently and, remarkably, eliminates the need for local addressing of single constituents before measurements. Inspired by the "spin-spiral" structure in magnetic materials, our scheme combines a series of measurement setups, each with different spiraling patterns, with compressed sensing techniques. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of tomographic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we show how this method is suitable for the measurement of specific entanglement properties of interesting quantum many-body states, such as entanglement entropy, in various realistic experimental conditions. This method offers a positive outlook across a wide range of quantum platforms, including those in which precise individual operations are challenging, such as optical lattice systems.

# Origin of the Unusual Temperature Dependence of the Upper Critical Field of Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5: Multiple Bands or van Hove Singularities?

arXiv:2411.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities (vHs) located close to the Fermi level in Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) have profound influence on their electronic and transport characteristics. Specifically, magneto-transport and susceptibility measurements on CsV3Sb5 reveal an anomalous temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_c2 (T), characterized by a pronounced upward curvature for both in-plane and c-axis magnetic fields, with zero-temperature H_c2 values of ~6.0 T and ~1.2 T, respectively. Our theoretical analysis, using a newly developed single-band model incorporating vHs and gap anisotropy, suggests that the observed upper critical field behavior is predominantly driven by the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity originating from vHs, instead of multi-band effects or gap anisotropy. Increased electron scattering introduced by proton irradiation defects smears out the vHs, reduces anisotropy, and recovers the conventional H_c2 (T) behavior, corroborating our proposed model.

Abstract: Ferroelectric (FE)-based devices show great promise for non-volatile memory applications, yet few demonstrate reliable operation at elevated temperatures. In this work, we fabricated and characterized metal ferroelectric semiconductor capacitors integrating Aluminum Scandium Nitride onto Silicon Carbide, a prospective high temperature semiconductor for logic operations in extreme environments. The resultant Ni/Al0.68Sc0.32N/4H-SiC structure was evaluated for non-volatile memory performance from room temperature to high-temperature conditions. The 30-nm thick Al0.68Sc0.32N/SiC-based ferroelectric capacitors demonstrated ferroelectric switching at 900 C. The coercive field of the FE layer decreased linearly from -6.4/+11.9 MV cm-1 at room temperature to -3.1/+7.8 MV cm-1 at 800 C. Using positive-up negative-down measurements, we characterized the temperature dependence of remanent polarization. At 600 C, the devices achieved remarkable reliability, demonstrating endurance of ~2000 cycles and retention exceeding 100 hours with negligible polarization loss. Further reliability measurements extended to 800 C with 10,000 secs retention and > 300 endurance cycles, establish these devices as promising candidates for high-temperature memory applications.

# Emergence of the 3D diluted Ising model universality class in a mixture of two magnets

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16659

arXiv:2411.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usually, the impact of structural disorder on the magnetic phase transition in the 3D Ising model is analyzed within the framework of quenched dilution by a non-magnetic component, where some lattice sites are occupied by Ising spins, while others are non-magnetic. This kind of quenched dilution, according to the Harris criterion, leads to a change in the critical exponents that govern the asymptotics in the vicinity of the phase transition point. However, the inherent reason for the emergence of a new, random Ising model universality class is not the presence of a non-magnetic component but the disorder in structure of spin arrangement. To demonstrate this fact, in this paper, we set up extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a random mixture of two Ising-like magnets that differ in spin length $s$ and concentration $c$. In doing so, we analyze the effect of structural disorder \textit{per se} without appealing to the presence of a non-magnetic component. We support our numerical simulations with renormalization group calculations. Our results demonstrate the emergence of the 3D randomly diluted Ising model universality class in a random mixture of two Ising magnets. While the asymptotic critical exponents coincide with those known for the site-diluted 3D Ising model, the effective critical behavior is triggered by parameters $s$ and $c$. The impact of their interplay is a subject of detailed analysis.

# Fully nonequilibrium Hall response from Berry curvature

## 来自Berry曲率的完全非平衡霍尔响应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16675

arXiv:2411.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological materials, Berry curvature leads to intrinsic Hall responses. Focusing on time-reversal symmetric systems with broken inversion symmetry, a spontaneoous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect is expected to develop under an applied electric field. Motivated by recent developments in Weyl-Kondo semimetals, here we advance a fully nonequilibrium (FNE) Hall response due to the Berry curvature. In particular, we show that, while the spontaneous Hall current is quadratic in the previously described regime of weak electric field, due to the contribution from the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, the FNE Hall response for non-perturbative electric fields is not controlled by the Berry curvature dipole. Remarkably, the FNE Hall response resembles what happens in systems that break the microscopic time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate the universality of these results by comparing them with their counterparts in systems with any higher-multipole of the Berry curvature. The implications of our results for the understanding of strongly correlated topological semimetals are discussed.

Abstract: There are several methods to improve cancer patient survival rates by inducing hyperthermia in tumor tissues, which involves raising their temperature above 41{\deg}C. These methods utilize different energy sources to deliver heat to the target region, including light, microwaves or radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. We have developed a new, magnetically responsive nanocarrier, consisting of liposomes loaded with magnetic nanoparticles and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP), commonly known as Cisplatin. The resulting magnetoliposome (ML) is rapidly internalized by lung and pancreas tumor cell lines, stored in intracellular vesicles, and capable of inducing hyperthermia under magnetic fields. The ML has no significant toxicity both in vitro and in vivo and, most importantly, enhances cell death by apoptosis after magnetic hyperthermia. Remarkably, mice bearing induced lung tumors, treated with CDDP-loaded nanocarriers and subjected to an applied electromagnetic field, showed an improved survival rate over those treated with either soluble CDDP or hyperthermia alone. Therefore, our approach of magnetic hyperthermia plus CDDP-ML significantly enhances in vitro cell death and in vivo survival of treated animals.

Abstract: Exotic forms of wave control have been emerging by engineering matter in space and time. In this framework, temporal photonic interfaces, i.e., abrupt changes in the electromagnetic properties of a material, have been shown to induce temporal scattering phenomena dual to spatial reflection and refraction, at the basis of photonic time crystals and space-time metamaterials. Despite decades-old theoretical studies on these topics, and recent experimental demonstrations, the careful modeling of these phenomena has been lagging behind. Here, we develop from first principles a rigorous model of the electrodynamics of temporal photonic interfaces, highlighting the crucial role of the mechanisms driving time variations. We demonstrate that the boundary conditions and conservation laws associated with temporal scattering may substantially deviate from those commonly employed in the literature, based on their microscopic implementation. Our results open new vistas for both fundamental investigations over light-matter interactions in time-varying structures and for the prospect of their future implementations and applications in optics and photonics.

Abstract: Topological characteristics of quantum systems are typically determined by the closing of a gap, while the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) during quantum real-time evolution has emerged as a nonequilibrium analog to the quantum phase transition (QPT). In this paper, we illustrate that the system dynamics can be elucidated by considering the precession of a collection of free-pseudo spins under a magnetic field based on the exact results of extended Kitaev chains. The topology of the driven Hamiltonian is determined by the average winding number of the nonequilibrium state. Furthermore, we establish that the singularity of the DQPT arises from two perpendicular pseudo-spin vectors associated with the pre- and post-quenched Hamiltonians. Moreover, we investigate the distinct behaviors of the dynamic pairing order parameter in both topological and non-topological regions. These findings offer valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of topological superconductors, contributing to the understanding of the resilience of topological properties in driven quantum systems.

Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a type of collinear magnetism, that is in some aspects distinct from ferromagnetism and from conventional antiferromagnetism. In contrast to the latter, sublattices of opposite spin are related by spatial rotations and not only by translations and inversions. As a result, altermagnets have spin-split bands leading to unique experimental signatures. Here, we show theoretically how a d-wave altermagnetic phase can be realized with ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices. We propose an altermagnetic Hubbard model with anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping and obtain the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. The altermagnetic phase separates in a metallic and an insulating phase and is robust over a large parameter regime. We show that one of the defining characteristics of altermagnetism, the anisotropic spin transport, can be probed with trap-expansion experiments.

Abstract: The atomic configuration of phases and their interfaces is fundamental to materials design and engineering. Here, we unveil a transition metal oxide interface, whose formation is driven by energetic influences - epitaxial tensile strain versus oxygen octahedra connectivity - that compete in determining the orientation of an orthorhombic perovskite film. We study this phenomenon in a system of LaVO$_3$ grown on (101) DyScO$_3$, using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy to measure intrinsic markers of orthorhombic symmetry. We identify that the film resolves this energetic conflict by switching its orientation by 90 degrees at an atomically-flat plane within its volume, not at the film/substrate interface. At either side of this "switching plane", characteristic orthorhombic distortions tend to zero to couple mismatched oxygen octahedra rotations. The resulting boundary is highly energetic, which makes it a priori unlikely; by using second-principles atomistic modeling, we show how its formation requires structural relaxation of an entire film grown beyond a critical thickness measuring tens of unit cells. The switching plane breaks the inversion symmetry of the Pnma orthorhombic structure, and sharply joins two regions, a thin intermediate layer and the film bulk, that are held under different mechanical strain states. By therefore contacting two distinct phases of one compound that would never otherwise coexist, this alternative type of interface opens new avenues for nanoscale engineering of functional systems, such as a chemically-uniform but magnetically inhomogeneous heterostructure.

Abstract: Topology, like symmetry, is a fundamental concept in understanding general properties of physical systems. In condensed matter, nontrivial topology may manifest itself as singular features in the energy spectrum or the quantization of electrical properties such as conductance and magnetic flux. Using microwave spectroscopy, we determine that a superconducting circuit with three Josephson tunnel junctions in parallel can possess degeneracies indicative of \emph{intrinsic} nontrivial topology. We identify three topological invariants, one of which is related to a hidden quantum mechanical supersymmetry. Measurements show that devices fabricated in different topological regimes fall on a simple phase diagram which should be robust to junction imperfections and geometric inductance. Josephson tunnel junction circuits, which are readily fabricated with conventional microlithography techniques, allow access to a wide range of topological systems that may have no condensed matter analog. Notable spectral features of these circuits, such as degeneracies and flat bands, may find use in quantum information, sensing, and metrology.

Abstract: Charge order pervades the phase diagrams of quantum materials where it competes with superconducting and magnetic phases, hosts electronic phase transitions and topological defects, and couples to the lattice generating intricate structural distortions. Incommensurate charge order is readily stabilized in manganese oxides where it is associated with anomalous electronic and magnetic properties, but its nanoscale structural inhomogeneity complicates precise characterization and understanding of its relationship with competing phases. Leveraging atomic-resolution variable temperature cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy, we characterize the thermal evolution of charge order as it transforms from its ground state in a model manganite system. We find that mobile networks of discommensurations and dislocations generate phase inhomogeneity and induce global incommensurability in an otherwise lattice-locked modulation. Driving the order to melt at high temperatures, the discommensuration density grows and regions of order locally decouple from the lattice periodicity.

# Topologically protected flatness in chiral moir\'e heterostructures

Abstract: The observation of delicate correlated phases in twisted heterostructures of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides suggests that moir\'e flat bands are intrinsically resilient against certain types of disorder. Here, we investigate the robustness of moir\'e flat bands in the chiral limit of the Bistrizer-MacDonald model -- applicable to both platforms in certain limits -- and demonstrate drastic differences between the first magic angle and higher magic angles in response to chiral symmetric disorder that arise, for instance, from lattice relaxation. Using a hidden constant of motion, we decompose the non-abelian gauge field induced by interlayer tunnelings into two decoupled abelian ones, whose effective magnetic field splits into an anomalous contribution and a fluctuating part. The anomalous field maps the moir\'e flat bands onto a zeroth Dirac Landau level, whose flatness withstands any chiral symmetric perturbation due to a topological index theorem -- thereby underscoring a topological mechanism for band flatness. Only the first magic angle can fully harness this topological protection due to its weak fluctuating magnetic field. In higher magic angles, the amplitude of fluctuations largely exceeds the anomalous contribution, which we find results in an extremely large sensitivity to microscopic details. Through numerical simulations, we study various types of disorder and identify the processes that are enhanced or suppressed in the chiral limit. Interestingly, we find that the topological suppression of disorder broadening persists away from the chiral limit and is further accentuated by isolating a single sublattice polarized flat band in energy. Our analysis suggests the Berry curvature hotspot at the top of the $K$ and $K'$ valence band in the transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers is essential for the stability of its moir\'e flat bands and their correlated states.

Abstract: We revealed the anomalous temperature behavior of the giant dielectric permittivity and unusual frequency dependences of the pyroelectric response of the fine-grained ceramics prepared by the spark plasma sintering of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The temperature dependences of the electro-resistivity indicate the frequency-dependent transition in the electro-transport mechanisms between the lower and higher conductivity states accompanied by the maximum in the temperature dependence of the loss angle tangent. The pyroelectric thermal-wave probing revealed the existence of the spatially inhomogeneous counter-polarized ferroelectric state at the opposite surfaces of the ceramic sample. We described the temperature behavior of the giant dielectric response and losses using the core-shell model for ceramic grains, effective medium approach and Maxwell-Wagner approach. The superparaelectric-like state with a giant dielectric response may appear due to the internal barrier-layer capacitance effect, while the step-like thermal activation of localized polarons in the semiconducting grains is not excluded. The elucidation of the state microscopic origin requires measurements in the frequency range above 1 MHz.

Abstract: In this paper we propose two theoretical models of a metallic N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnet with charge-density wave order which shows the anomalous Hall effect. In our models a combination of the N\'{e}el order and the charge-density wave order results in spin splitting of the conducting fermions. In addition, spin-orbit coupling is required to drive the anomalous Hall effect. In the first model we analyzed the effects of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, and of the intrinsic $d-$wave spin-orbit coupling in the second model.

Abstract: Hole spin qubits are rapidly emerging as the workhorse of semiconducting quantum processors because of their large spin-orbit interaction, enabling fast all-electric operations at low power. However, spin-orbit interaction also causes non-uniformities in devices, resulting in locally varying qubit energies and site-dependent anisotropies. While these anisotropies can be used to drive single-spins, if not properly harnessed, they can hinder the path toward large-scale quantum processors. Here, we report on microwave-driven singlet-triplet qubits in planar germanium and use them to investigate the anisotropy of two spins in a double quantum dot. We show two distinct operating regimes depending on the magnetic field direction. For in-plane fields, the two spins are largely anisotropic, and electrically tunable, which enables to measure all the available transitions; coherence times exceeding 3 $\mu$s are extracted. For out-of-plane fields, they have an isotropic response but preserve the substantial energy difference required to address the singlet-triplet qubit. Even in this field direction, where the qubit lifetime is strongly affected by nuclear spins, we find 400 ns coherence times. Our work adds a valuable tool to investigate and harness the anisotropy of spin qubits and can be implemented in any large-scale NxN device, facilitating the path towards scalable quantum processors.

Abstract: The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in condensed matter physics has drawn attention to kagome antiferromagnets (AFM) where a two-dimensional corner-sharing network of triangles frustrates conventional magnetic orders. While quantum kagome AFMs based on Cu$^{2+}$ (3d$^9$, $s=\frac{1}{2}$) ions have been extensively studied, there is so far little work beyond copper-based systems. Here we present our bulk magnetization, specific heat and neutron scattering studies on single crystals of a new titanium fluoride Cs$_8$RbK$_3$Ti$_{12}$F$_{48}$ where Ti$^{3+}$ (3d$^1$, $s = \frac{1}{2}$) ions form a modulated quantum kagome antiferromagnet that does not order magnetically down to 1.5 K. Our comprehensive map of the dynamic response function $S(Q,\hbar\omega)$ acquired at 1.5 K where the heat capacity is T-linear reveals a dispersive continuum emanating from soft lines that extend along (100). The data indicate fractionalized spinon-like excitations with quasi-one-dimensional dispersion within a quasi-two-dimensional spin system.

# High-Throughput Discovery of Kagome Materials in Transition Metal Oxide Monolayers

arXiv:2410.08501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome materials are known for hosting exotic quantum states, including quantum spin liquids, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. The search for kagome monolayers is driven by their ability to exhibit neat and well-defined kagome bands near the Fermi level, which are more easily realized in the absence of interlayer interactions. However, this absence also destabilizes the monolayer forms of many bulk kagome materials, posing significant challenges to their discovery. In this work, we propose a strategy to address this challenge by utilizing oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides within a "1+3" design framework. Through high-throughput computational screening of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 thermodynamically stable kagome monolayers with diverse electronic and magnetic properties. These materials were classified into three categories based on their lattice geometry, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic configurations. Detailed analysis of three representative monolayers revealed kagome band features near their Fermi levels, with orbital contributions varying between oxygen 2p and transition metal d states. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy, offering a promising approach to uncovering low-dimensional kagome materials and advancing the exploration of their quantum phenomena.

Abstract: We investigate quantum phase transitions in a topological Josephson junction with an embedded ferromagnetic layer, revealing a rich landscape of critical phenomena. The low-energy excitations comprise Majorana fermions propagating along the junction, coupled to the magnons in the ferromagnet. Based on mean-field and renormalization group arguments, we predict Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions in this system, both in the case of a magnetic easy-plane and weak easy-axis anisotropy. In the latter case, this is based on an emergent effective easy-plane, spanned by the easy-axis and the component of the magnetization which couples to the Majoranas. We conclude by presenting a conjecture for the full phase diagram of the model. It covers BKT transitions as well as exotic multicritical and supersymmetric points known from related models of interacting real fermions and bosons.

Abstract: The impact of uniform lattice strain (with lattice parameter (LP), $a = 5.62$-$5.83$ \r{A}) and tetragonal lattice distortion (with $0.8 \leq c/a \leq1.2$ and $V_0$ volume; resulting LP: $a = 5.38$-$5.92$ \r{A}, $c = 5.33$-$6.45$ \r{A}) on the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of CoFeCrGa SGS alloy (optimized LP: $a = 5.72$ \r{A}) has been investigated. The SGS nature of CoFeCrGa remains robust under uniform strain; however, the tetragonal lattice distortion has a detrimental impact on the SGS nature, and even a small distortions lead to metallic nature for CoFeCrGa. Despite this, the tetragonally distorted structures maintain high spin polarization (SP $\geq 60\% $); except for the structure with $c/a = 0.8$, for which SP significantly decreases to $\sim 25\%$. The lattice deformation-induced magnetic anisotropy (MA) is also explored by considering the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) and the magnetic shape anisotropy (MSA). Both MCA and MSA eliminate for the Y-I ordered and uniformly strained structures, resulting in a magnetic isotropic nature for them. Conversely, the tetragonally distorted structures with $c/a < 1.0$ and $c/a > 1.0$ exhibit very high in-plane magnetic anisotropy and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, respectively; with magnitudes of $\sim 10^5$-$10^6$ J/m$^3$. For tetragonally deformed structures, MSA contribution to MA is negligible, and thus, MCA dictates the total MA. In summary, the isotropically strained structures show SGS nature, while the tetragonally distorted structures exhibit the high MA along with high SP.

Abstract: We study the ponderomotive potential of a bosonic Josephson junction periodically modulated by a high-frequency electromagnetic field. Within the small population difference approximation, the ponderomotive drive induces the well-known Kapitza pendulum effect, stabilizing a $\pi$-phase mode. We discuss the parameter dependence of the dynamical transition from macroscopic quantum self-trapping to $\pi$-Josephson oscillations. Furthermore, we examine the situation where the small population difference approximation fails. In this case, an essential momentum-shortening effect emerges, leading to a stabilized $\pi/2$-phase mode under certain conditions. By mapping this to a classical pendulum scenario, we highlight the uniqueness and limitations of the $\pi/2$-phase mode in bosonic Josephson junctions.

Abstract: Exchange couplings are fundamental to our understanding of many physical phenomena in condensed matter physics and material science. Model systems provide a controlled environment to investigate such phenomena, effectively. In this study, we employ first-principle calculations based on density functional theory and Green's function (GF) method to explore the impact of chemical structure on the sign and magnitude of exchange coupling, systematically. By designing model systems with bcc-Fe bulk doped with nonmagnetic X= (H, B, C, N, O, and F) atoms, we examine the effects of different ligands on the behavior of Fe-Fe exchange coupling, and demonstrate that the chemical environment surrounding the metal atom significantly influences the Fe-Fe exchange coupling. Our results highlight the tunability of exchange coupling based on Fe-dopant bond length(s), where the nature of ligand atoms and their electron correlation play a crucial role. This work illuminates the complex relationship between structure, and magnetism in magnetic materials, providing insights into the development of high-performance magnetic materials.

Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.

Abstract: Using radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy, we measure the $p$-wave contacts in a Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance. The RF spectrum exhibits clear asymptotic behavior, characterized by $\tilde{\omega}^{-1/2}$ and $\tilde{\omega}^{-3/2}$ dependencies. The magnetic-field dependence of the $p$-wave contacts agrees reasonably well with the virial expansion theory in a detuned magnetic field range, validating the theory near the Fermi temperature. The $p$-wave contacts measured in this study constitute a second dataset, complementing the data obtained from the $^{40}$K system and contributing valuable insights into $p$-wave interactions in ultracold Fermi gases.

Abstract: Sutherland considered the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic spin ring for all total spin sectors. He discovered that there is an instability at total spin $0$. The total spin 1 sector has a higher energy groundstate than the groundstate among spin singlets. He called this ``weak paramagnetism.''
  Some parts of Sutherland's analysis were obscure. There was a later reconsideration by Dhar and Shastry, who showed that Bloch wall states give a good approximation to the lowest energy eigenstates in each momentum sector. Unfortunately, their ansatz demonstrates no weak paramagnetism.
  The question resurfaced due to a conjecture called ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels,'' which Sutherland's weak paramagnetism falsifies. We show that Sutherland's finding is numerically validated for spin rings up to size $L=20$. We also show Dhar and Shastry's approximation is demonstrably inexact at total spin $0$, for theoretical reasons. We finally show that the single mode approximation together with a symmetry of the spin singlet can explain weak paramagnetism, heuristically.

Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems is a major problem in quantum matter. Specifically, efficiently solving the spectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator governing such dynamics remains a critical open challenge. Here, we put forward a method for solving the many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics based on the non-Hermitian kernel polynomial method and tensor-network techniques. We demonstrate the faithfulness of our method by computing the dynamics of the dephasing quantum compass model with a gradient magnetic field and comparing it with exact results. In particular, we show that our method allows us to characterize the quantum Zeno crossover and the reduction of relaxation rate due to Stark localization in this model. We further demonstrate the ability of our method to go beyond exact results by exploring nearest-neighbor interaction effects on the Liouvillian dynamics, elucidating the interplay between Stark localization and many-body interactions. Our method provides an efficient solution to many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics, establishing a methodology to explore large open quantum many-body systems.

arXiv:2409.11944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasispecies concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called "Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the "Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalize this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to variations in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution as the order parameter.

Abstract: The development of spintronic emitters of broadband THz pulses relies on designing heterostructures where processes of laser-driven spin current generation and subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion are the most efficient. An interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the emitter is one of the critical elements. Here, we study experimentally single-cycle THz pulse generation from a laser-pulse excited Pt/Co emitter with a composition gradient interface between Pt and Co and compare it with the emission from a conventional Pt/Co structure with an abrupt interface. We find that the gradient interface enhances the efficiency of optics-to-THz conversion by a factor of two in a wide range of optical fluences up to 3 mJ cm$^{-2}$. We reveal that this enhancement is caused by a pronounced increase in transmittance of the laser-driven spin-polarized current through the gradient interface compared to the abrupt one. Furthermore, we find that such a transmission deteriorates with laser fluence due to the spin accumulation effect.

Abstract: In this work, we prove the equivalence between the zero distributions of the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s) and a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a mixture of ferromagnetic and randomly distributed competing interactions. At first, we review briefly the characteristics of the Riemann hypothesis and its connections to physics, in particular, to statistical physics. Second, we build a 2D Ising model, M_(FI+SGI)^2D, in which interactions between the nearest neighboring spins are ferromagnetic along one crystallographic direction while competing ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interactions are randomly distributed along another direction. Third, we prove that all energy eigenvalues of this 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D are real and randomly distributed as the M\"obius function {\mu}(n), the Dirichlet L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function as well as the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s). Fourth, we prove that the eigenvectors of the 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D are constructed by the eigenvectors of the 1D Ising model with phases related to the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s), via the relation {\omega}({\gamma}_2j) between the angle {\omega} and the energy eigenvalues {\gamma}_2j, which form the Hilbert-P\'olya space. Fifth, we prove that all the zeros of the partition function of the 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D lie on an unit circle in a complex temperature plane (i.e. Fisher zeros), which can be mapped to the zero distribution of the Dirichlet L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function and also the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s) in the critical line. In a conclusion, we have proven the closure of the nontrivial zero distribution of the L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function (including the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s)).

Abstract: Navier-Stokes and Maxwell equations have been invented for fluid dynamics and electromagnetic systems, respectively, for centuries. The development of Navier-Stokes and Maxwell equations for homogeneous materials seems to be mature. However, when there is a phase interface, a coupling theory for the mass transport with the propagation of electromagnetic fields remains an open question. In the current work, we present a fundamental theory for the thermodynamics and the kinetics for mass transport and electromagnetic wave propagation in non-uniform system when an interface is present. We will demonstrate that Maxwell-Ampere equation, Lorenz force, and Gauss' law for magnetic field all have to be modified at the phase interface. We expect that the modified Lorenz force and Maxwell equations will shed light on high-temperature superconductivity, where the coupling of mass effect, such as thermal noise, with electromagnetic fields is necessary.

arXiv:2411.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves in anisotropic media (e.g., weakly absorbing biaxial dielectric crystals) have a singular profile of the form $\propto (\mathbf{n} \mathbf{r}) \exp(i q \mathbf{n} \mathbf{r})$ along special directions, they are also known as Voigt waves. Therefore, for such directions, the wave polarization depend on the coordinate. A similar singular form is possible for surface waves, but the conditions for its appearance are less strict. The boundary between two, generally different, uniaxial media is considered. Conditions have been determined under which a surface polariton can propagate along the boundary and has a field distribution of singular form in both media. The existence condition of a bisingular surface polariton strongly depends on the angle between the optic axes of the media. It is shown that in simple cases (one the media is almost isotropic, or two identical uniaxial media) a bisingular polariton exists only for a single angle between the optic axes. In general, for two arbitrary media there can be up to five such angles.

arXiv:2411.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron oxide (e.g., Fe$_3$O$_4$ or Fe$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles are promising candidates for a variety of biomedical applications ranging from magnetic hyperthermia therapy to drug delivery and bio-detection, due to their superparamagnetism, non-toxicity, and biodegradability. While particles of small size (below a critical size, ~20 nm) display superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature, these particles tend to penetrate highly sensitive areas of the body such as the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), leading to undesired effects. In addition, these particles possess a high probability of retention, which can lead to genotoxicity and biochemical toxicity. Increasing particle size is a means for addressing these problems but also suppresses the superparamagnetism. We have overcome this particle size limit by synthesizing unique polycrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles composed of multiple nanocrystals of 10 to 15 nm size while tuning particle size from 160 to 400 nm. These so-called superparticles preserve superparamagnetic characteristics and exhibit excellent hyperthermia responses. The specific absorption rates (SAR) exceed 250 W/g (HAC = 800 Oe, f = 310 kHz) at a low concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, indicating their capability in cancer treatment with minimum dose. Our study underscores the potential of size-tunable polycrystalline iron oxide superparticles with superparamagnetic properties for advanced biomedical applications and sensing technologies.

Abstract: The work considers an optical scheme for collimation of high-energy proton beams using $\sim 10^5$ T scale magnetic fields induced in a miniature "snail" target by petawatt or multi-petawatt laser irradiation in ps or fs regime. Such magnetic fields are known to be frozen into hot plasma and exist on at least a hundred of picoseconds time-scale, allowing their use for control of charged particle beams. The high values of the magnetic field along with the compact size perfectly match conditions for an all-in-one optical setup, where first, the laser beam accelerates protons, by, e.g. Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism, and second, the closely positioned snail target is driven to guide the proton beam. An important issue is that the laser drivers for both proton acceleration schemes and the magnetic field generation in the considered targets may have the same properties, and even be parts of one splitted beam. Numerical simulations show that the considered setup can be used for efficient collimation of $\simeq 100$ MeV protons. The collimation effect weakly depends on the fine magnetic field structure and can be observed both for a simple magneto-dipole field profile and for a more complex coaxial-like profiles accounting for the intricate structure of electric currents in the interaction region. The obtained results are interesting for the development of intense laser-driven sources of charged particle beams with low divergence and high energy of accelerated particles.

The O in the bulk Al0.73Sc0.27N was introduced through an external gas source during the reactive sputter process. In comparison to samples without doping, O-doped films showed almost a fourfold reduction of the leakage current near the coercive field. In addition, doping resulted in the reduction of the steady-state leakage currents by roughly one order of magnitude sub-coercive fields. Microstructure analysis using X-ray diffraction 1and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed no significant structural degradation of the bulk Al0.73Sc0.27N. In case of the maximum O-doped film, the c-axis out-of-plane texture increased by only 20% from 1.8{\deg} and chemical mapping revealed a uniform distribution of oxygen incorporation into the bulk. Our results further demonstrate the ability to control the as-deposited polarity of Al0.73Sc0.27N via the O-concentration, changing from nitrogen- to metal-polar orientation. Thus, this article presents a promising approach to mitigate the leakage current in wurtzite-type Al0.73Sc0.27N without incurring any significant structural degradation of the bulk thin film quality, thereby making ferroelectric nitrides more suitable for microelectronic applications.

# Relativistic two-wave resonant acceleration of electrons at large-amplitude standing whistler waves during laser-plasma interaction

Abstract: The interaction between a thin foil target and a circularly polarized laser light injected along an external magnetic field is investigated numerically by particle-in-cell simulations. A standing wave appears at the front surface of the target, overlapping the injected and partially reflected waves. Hot electrons are efficiently generated at the standing wave due to the relativistic two-wave resonant acceleration if the magnetic field amplitude of the standing wave is larger than the ambient field. A bifurcation occurs in the gyration motion of electrons, allowing all electrons with non-relativistic velocities to acquire relativistic energy through the cyclotron resonance. The optimal conditions for the highest energy and the most significant fraction of hot electrons are derived precisely through a simple analysis of test-particle trajectories in the standing wave. Since the number of hot electrons increases drastically by many orders of magnitude compared to the conventional unmagnetized cases, this acceleration could be a great advantage in laser-driven ion acceleration and its applications.

arXiv:2411.17517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-future experiments with Petawatt class lasers are expected to produce a high flux of gamma-ray photons and electron-positron pairs through Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamical processes. Simulations of the expected regime of laser-matter interaction are computationally intensive due to the disparity of the spatial and temporal scales and because quantum and classical descriptions need to be accounted for simultaneously (classical for collective effects and quantum for nearly-instantaneous events of hard photon emission and pair creation). A typical configuration for experiments is a scattering of an electron and a laser beam which can be mapped to an equivalent problem with constant magnetic field. We study the stochastic cooling of an electron beam in a strong constant uniform magnetic field, both its particle distribution functions and their energy momenta. We start by obtaining approximate closed-form analytical solutions to the relevant observables. Then, we apply the quantum-hybrid Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution to the Fokker-Planck equation describing this process, and compare against theory and results from Particle-In-Cell simulations and classical Partial Differential Equation solvers, showing good agreement. This work will be useful as a first step towards quantum simulation of plasma physics scenarios where diffusion processes are important, in particular in strong electromagnetic fields.

# Enhancement of magnetic spin Hall angle by extrinsic surface roughness

Abstract: The magnetic spin Hall effect arises from a reactive counterpart of the dissipative spin response that is responsible for the ordinary spin Hall effect. This interpretation is supported by the dependence of spin Hall effect signals on the reversal of magnetic order parameters and can be explained in terms of the symmetries of well-defined linear response functions. This proposal has enabled the generation and manipulation of spin currents electrically. In terms of conversion efficiency, the spin Hall angle is a key parameter used to characterize a material's ability to convert spin currents to charge currents and vice versa. Consequently, there is an ongoing effort to identify mechanisms that can increase the spin Hall angle. In theis work, it is proposed a mechanism based on extrinsic surface roughness, which enhances the magnetic spin Hall angle when the ratio of roughness to thickness is high. This mechanism represents an important discovery that will advance the development of charge-to-spin devices.

arXiv:2411.16835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically-addressable spin qubits form the foundation of a new generation of emerging nanoscale sensors. The engineering of these sensors has mainly focused on solid-state systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. However, NVs are restricted in their ability to interface with biomolecules due to their bulky diamond host. Meanwhile, fluorescent proteins have become the gold standard in bioimaging, as they are genetically encodable and easily integrated with biomolecules. While fluorescent proteins have been suggested to possess a metastable triplet state, they have not been investigated as qubit sensors. Here, we realize an optically-addressable spin qubit in the Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) enabled by a novel spin-readout technique. A near-infrared laser pulse allows for triggered readout of the triplet state with up to 44% spin contrast. Using coherent microwave control of the EYFP spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a spin-lattice relaxation time of $(141 \pm 5)$ {\mu}s, a $(16 \pm 2)$ {\mu}s coherence time under Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) decoupling, and a predicted oscillating (AC) magnetic field sensitivity with an upper bound of $183 \, \mathrm{fT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically-detected magnetic resonance at room temperature in aqueous solution with contrast up to 3%, and measure a static (DC) field sensitivity with an upper bound of $93 \, \mathrm{pT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. Our results establish fluorescent proteins as a powerful new qubit sensor platform and pave the way for applications in the life sciences that are out of reach for solid-state technologies.

# Controlled angular momentum injection in a magnetically levitated He II droplet

arXiv:2411.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The morphology of rotating viscous classical liquid droplets has been extensively studied and is well understood. However, our understanding of rotating superfluid droplets remains limited. For instance, superfluid $^4$He (He II) can carry angular momentum through two distinct mechanisms: the formation of an array of quantized vortex lines, which induce flows resembling classical solid-body rotation, and surface traveling deformation modes associated with irrotational internal flows. These two mechanisms can result in significantly different droplet morphologies, and it remains unclear how the injected angular momentum is partitioned between them. To investigate this complex problem experimentally, one must first levitate an isolated He II droplet using techniques such as magnetic levitation. However, an outstanding challenge lies in effectively injecting angular momentum into the levitated droplet. In this paper, we describe a magneto-optical cryostat system designed to levitate He II droplets and present the design of a time-dependent, non-axially symmetric electric driving system. Based on our numerical simulations, this system should enable controlled angular momentum injection into the droplet. This study lays the foundation for future investigations into the morphology of rotating He II droplets.

Abstract: Magnetic kagome lattices have attracted much attention recently due to the interplay of band topology with magnetism and electronic correlations, which give rise to a variety of exotic quantum states. A common structural distortion of the kagome lattice is the breathing mode, which can significantly influence the magnetism and band characteristics. However, the modulation of breathing mode and the associated topological phenomena remain rarely explored. Here, we demonstrate that the coupling of breathing modes with ferroelectricity, magnetism, and band topology in the M3X8 monolayer system enables electric field manipulation of topological spin structure and electronic states. The breathing mode mainly occurs in materials containing early 4d/5d transition metal elements and can be reversed or even suppressed via ferroelectric switching in low-barrier materials. Importantly, electric field-induced switching of the breathing mode can alter the chirality of the topological spin structure, or trigger a transition from a topological trivial insulator to a Chern insulator. This work paves the way for exploring novel physical phenomena driven by breathing modes in kagome materials.

Abstract: Using the Skyrme model Sk$\chi$450 constrained by the chiral effective field theory and the ground-state energies of doubly-magic nuclei, we explore the macroscopic static energy spectrum of dense matter. Structure of the matter is idealized as 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional periodic Coulomb lattices (pasta phases) at average baryon density in the range of $0.005n_0-0.5n_0$ with $n_0\sim0.16$ fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to the inner crust of neutron stars. In the earlier work, the bulk and the surface nuclear properties in this scenario were described on the basis of different nuclear interactions. As a result, predictions for the inner crust structure based on those numerical results are not necessarily self-consistent. In this work, we solve this problem by describing the nuclear properties and proton-proton Cooper pairing in a unified manner, \emph{i.e.} based on the same nuclear interaction. We calculate the surface tension to the leading order (planar surface) and to the next-to-leading order (from nonzero principal curvature) at the Extended Thomas-Fermi level. Next, we develop and solve a system of equations within the compressible liquid drop model (LDM), which provides us with all necessary information about the macroscopic static energy spectrum of the nuclear structure. We find that the curvature corrections change the ground state in a relevant way. We also find that, typically, the energy differences between the different pasta phases are less than the thermal energy for temperatures $\sim10^8-10^9$ K, which implies that the real nuclear pasta phases are likely polymorphic. Finally, for 1-dimensional pasta phase we evaluate the superconducting coherence length of protons, the London penetration depth and the superconducting energy gap. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the pasta phases.

Abstract: 2D magnetic semiconductor CrSBr exhibits unique magneto-optical properties, yet its electronic structure and photophysical mechanisms remain unclear at high magnetic field and low temperature. Through comprehensive spectroscopic investigations, its charge-transfer band edge is identified at 500 nm. Below this band-edge, local excitonic magnetic polaronic states from Cr3+ ions out of FM aggregates in layer and bilayer could be seen due to phonon-spin-exciton coupling, in which magnetic polaronic PL1 emission occurs at 720 nm from single Cr3+ d-d transition, a dark-state pair exciton occurs at 850 nm in 10 K magnetic field, and double-peak PL2 emission at 920 nm out of Cr3+ FM trimer in monolayer is seen; besides, the magnetic bi-polaronic PL3 at 990 nm can be assigned to Cr3+ tetramers between FM adjacent layers. In magnetic field perpendicular to the layer, direct competition between PL1and dark-state excitons and PL2 and PL3 excitonic states persist in different temperatures. This study sheds light on the complicated magneto-exciton interactions in the multi-body effect of CrSBr, beneficial for quantum modulation in layered magnetic semiconductors.

# One dimensional chains of nickelocene fragments on Au(111)

arXiv:2411.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature-dependent deposition of nickelocene (NiCp$_2$) molecules on a single crystal Au(111) substrate, revealing distinct adsorption behaviors and structural formations. At low temperatures (4.2 K), individual NiCp$_2$ molecules adsorb on the herringbone elbows and step edges, forming ordered patterns as molecular coverage increases. However, at 77 K, the molecules dissociate, yielding two main fragments: NiCp fragments that are Ni atoms capped by cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings, which preferentially adsorb at FCC hollow sites, and Cp radical fragments exhibiting strong substrate interactions. NiCp fragments self-assemble into one-dimensional (1-D) chains along the $\langle 1 1 \bar{2} \rangle$ directions, displaying higher protrusion in STM images. The strain and steric hindrance from the Cp protons induce chiral patterns within the chains, which are well-reproduced by our DFT simulations. In contrast, the Cp fragments maintain distances due to short-range repulsive forces and exhibit low diffusion barriers. Interestingly, the fragments are non-magnetic, as confirmed by both STM measurements and DFT calculations, in contrast to the magnetic signals from intact Nc molecules. In addition to linear chains, dimers of the Ni-Cp fragments form along the $\langle 1 \bar{1} 0\rangle$ directions, requiring gold adatoms for their creation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing complex nanostructures based on metallocenes via on-surface synthesis, opening the possibility for realizing low-dimensional magnetic systems by selecting substrates that preserve the magnetic moment of the fragments.

Abstract: In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the bulk magnetization of a sample is commonly assumed to be proportional to spin polarization, with each spin of the same type contributing equally to the measured signal. In this work, we prove the high-field theorem for general spin-I systems (where I is the spin quantum number): the total measurable NMR signal remains unaffected by the grouping of spins into equivalent units (e.g., molecules), provided the system is at thermodynamic equilibrium in the high field limit (hbar\omega_0 >> |H_spin-spin|, where \omega_0 is the Larmor frequency and |H_spin-spin| characterizes internal spin-spin interactions). The results are derived using both magnetization equations and density matrix formalism. The theorem, however, does not extend to conditions far from thermodynamic equilibrium or such as zero- to ultralow-field NMR. We also present three educational problems designed to deepen understanding of the material in classroom settings. This work reinforces established principles in magnetic resonance but also highlights areas for further exploration.

Abstract: In space plasmas, large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves can drive compressive perturbations, accelerate ion beams, and lead to plasma heating and the excitation of ion acoustic waves at kinetic scales. This energy channelling from fluid to kinetic scales represents a complementary path to the classical turbulent cascade. Here, we present observational and computational evidence to validate this hypothesis by simultaneously resolving the fluid-scale Alfv\'en waves, kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves, and their imprints on ion velocity distributions in the Earth's magnetopause boundary layer. We show that two coexisting compressive modes, driven by the magnetic pressure gradients of Alfv\'en waves, not only accelerate the ion tail population to the Alfv\'en velocity, but also heat the ion core population near the ion acoustic velocity and generate Debye-scale ion acoustic waves. Thus, Alfv\'en-acoustic energy channeling emerges as a viable mechanism for plasma heating near plasma boundaries where large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves are present.

Abstract: In the past, quasi coherent modes were reported for nearly all tokamaks. The general definition describes modes as quasi coherent when the magnitude squared coherence is in the range of \SIrange{0.3}{0.6}{}. Quasi coherent modes are observed in the plasma core as well as in the plasma edge and can have quite different physical origins. The one in the core are observed in plasmas with low collisionality, where the electron temperature exceeds the ion temperature in the plasma core. This is the case for electron cyclotron heating in general. The origin of these modes are electrons trapped within a magnetic mirror, as reported in the past from various fusion devices. The so-called trapped-electron modes (TEMs) belong to drift wave instabilities and can be destabilized by electron-temperature gradients in the plasma core. From the diagnostic point of view, quasi coherent modes appear as fluctuations in electron density and temperature. Therefore, the microwave reflectometer is very well suited to monitor these modes. This paper describes experiments, conducted at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator (W7-X), which aim at detecting quasi coherent modes at low wave numbers. A Poloidal Correlation Reflectometer (PCR) installed at W7-X, is able to measure low wave numbers ($k_\perp\le 3.5$ cm$^{-1}$). For different magnetic configurations and plasma parameters, broad quasi-coherent structures are observed in the coherence spectra. From the analysis of the rotation and the poloidal structure, these quasi coherent (QC) modes show the properties of electron-temperature-gradient driven TEMs. A linear relation between the mode velocity and the rotation frequency is found. The relation is uniform and confirms the nature of QC-mode observation as TEM in tokamaks, too.

Abstract: The influence of the presence of cosmic fluid on the magnetosonic waves and modulation instabilities in the interstellar medium of spiral galaxies is investigated. The fluid model is developed by modifying the pressure equation in such dissipative rotating magnetoplasmas incorporating thermal ionized gas and cosmic rays. Applying the normal mode analysis, a modified dispersion relation is derived to study linear magnetosonic wave modes and their instabilities. The cosmic rays influence the wave damping by accelerating the damping rate. The standard reductive perturbation method is employed in the fluid model leading to a Korteweg de Vries Burgers (KdVB) equation in the small-amplitude limit. Several nonlinear wave shapes are assessed by solving the KdVB equation, analytically and numerically. The cosmic ray diffusivity and magnetic resistivity are responsible for the generation of shock waves. The modulational instability (MI) and the rogue wave solutions of the magnetosonic waves are studied by deriving a nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation from the obtained KdVB equation under the assumption that the cosmic ray diffusion and magnetic resistivity are weak and the carrier wave frequency is considerably lower than the wave frequency. The influence of various plasma parameters on the growth rate of MI is examined. The modification of the pressure term due to cosmic fluid reduces the MI growth in the interstellar medium. In addition, a quantitative analysis of the characteristics of rogue wave solutions is presented. Our investigation's applicability to the interstellar medium of spiral galaxies is traced out.

Abstract: The gyro-kinetic model is an approximation of the Vlasov-Maxwell system in a strongly magnetized magnetic field. We propose a new algorithm for solving it combining the Semi-Lagrangian (SL) method and the Arakawa (AKW) scheme with a time-integrator. Both methods are successfully used in practice for different kinds of applications, in our case, we combine them by first decomposing the problem into a fast (parallel) and a slow (perpendicular) dynamical system. The SL approach and the AKW scheme will be used to solve respectively the fast and the slow subsystems. Compared to the scheme in [1], where the entire model is solved using only the SL method, our goal is to replace the method used in the slow subsystem by the AKW scheme, in order to improve the conservation of the physical constants.

Recent advances in the synthesis of graphene fragments that possess unpaired π-electrons and display high-spin ground states have unlocked possibilities to explore exotic physical phenomena related to magnetism. The high degree of spin-delocalisation makes these non-metal-based systems ideal building blocks for the construction of chains and lattices with strongly correlated magnetic ground states, which is the main requisite for measurement-based quantum computation. In this work, we demonstrate the magnetic bistability of a diradical nanographene that allows direct spin manipulation at the single-molecule level. To this end, we made use of solution-phase synthesis and tip-induced activation on a metallic surface to construct a helical non-Kekulé hydrocarbon spin switch, with a reversible transformation between a magnetic ground state and a non-magnetic one via intramolecular bond formation/breaking. The switching process was monitored by scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements, illustrating that this, and related systems, hold potential as spin-switch units for direct manipulation of magnetism and quantum information in entangled spin systems.

# Giant Cardiac Hemangioma: Case Report and Literature Review

## 心脏巨大血管瘤1例报告并文献复习

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5248617/latest

Introduction: Primary cardiac tumors are extremely rare, posing significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Among them, cardiac hemangiomas are particularly uncommon, constituting only a small percentage of benign heart tumors. Although benign, their unpredictable behavior and potential compression of adjacent cardiac structures can lead to significant complications. This study reports a rare case of a giant cardiac hemangioma, along with a comprehensive literature review.
Case Report: A 58-year-old female patient presented with progressive abdominal pain and dyspnea. Imaging studies revealed a heterogeneous mass within the pericardial sac. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a lesion measuring 119 x 117 x 67 mm without apparent invasion of the cardiac wall. The patient underwent complete surgical resection of the tumor, with a satisfactory postoperative recovery. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a giant cavernous hemangioma.
Discussion: The literature review highlights the rarity of cardiac hemangiomas and the importance of complete resection to ensure a favorable prognosis. A multidisciplinary approach, combined with the use of advanced imaging modalities, is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate surgical planning.
Conclusion: Effective management of giant cardiac hemangiomas requires an integrated approach among various specialties, aimed at early diagnosis and complete resection. Long-term follow-up is necessary to detect potential recurrences.

Background This study aimed to investigate the texture changes in the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) in patients with unilateral anterior disc displacement (uADD) of the temporomandibular joint with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods This retrospective study aimed to comparatively analyze the texture of the LPM in 232 patients with uADD from January 2022 to December 2023. Four groups were included in this study: the healthy joints of patients with uADD (H-TMJ), joints with anterior disc displacement (ADD) with reduction (ADDwR), joints with ADD without reduction (ADDwoR), and the joints of normal volunteers as the healthy group (HG). Five texture parameters were used for analysis: the angular second moment (ASM), contrast, inverse difference moment (IDM) and entropy.Results The average differences in the ASM, contrast, correlation, IDM, and entropy of the LPM between the joints of healthy individuals and those of individuals with uADD were &amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1.16&amp;times;10&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;4, 7.65, 2.66&amp;times;10&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;5, 1.06&amp;times;10&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;2, and 9.21&amp;times;10&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;2, respectively, with P values less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance. The entropy values of the ADDwoR and ADDwR groups was 6.38&amp;times;10&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;2, with a statistically significant difference (P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.05). In addition, the H values for ASM, contrast, correlation, IDM, and entropy among the different degrees of disc displacement were 6.52, 15.45, 12.96, 7.72, and 11.66, respectively, with P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.05, indicating statistical significance. Through correlation analysis, the correlation coefficient between the disc displacement and the ASM was 0.082 (P&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;0.05), with no statistical significance. The corresponding correlation coefficients for contrast, correlation, IDM, and entropy values were &amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;0.146, 0.102, 0.098, and &amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;0.092, respectively, with P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.05.Conclusions Patients with ADD experience changes in the texture parameters of the LPM; among these, the entropy value of the LPM has high value in distinguishing ADDwoR from ADDwR, which can be used as an indicator to evaluate diseases that cause changes in the lateral pterygoid muscles. In addition, the degree of disc displacement is correlated to different degrees to the texture parameters. However, more research is needed to confirm the correlation between each numerical texture change and the corresponding pathological changes in the LMP.
