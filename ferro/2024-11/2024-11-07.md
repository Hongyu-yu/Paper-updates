Abstract: In this work, we study an Ericsson cycle whose working substance is a charged (quantum) oscillator in a magnetic field that is coupled to a heat bath. The resulting quantum Langevin equations with built-in noise terms encapsulate a thermodynamic structure and allow for the computation of the efficiency of the cycle. We numerically compute the efficiency of the cycle in the quasi-static regime using the steady-state thermodynamic functions of the system. Interestingly, it is found that by increasing the system-bath coupling strength, the efficiency of the cycle can be enhanced although it falls off for larger values of the coupling strength. We also explore the behavior of the efficiency as a function of the pair of magnetic-field values between which the cycle is operated.

# Geometric fractionalized Fermi liquids: Hidden antiferromagnetism and pseudogap from fluctuating stripes

## 几何分馏的费米液体: 隐藏的反铁磁性和来自波动条纹的伪间隙

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03419

arXiv:2411.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) phases. The topological nature of the FL* phase has been identified as a scenario compatible with a small Fermi surface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative FL* scenario: a fractionalized Fermi liquid with a geometric origin (GFL*) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP) featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GFL* framework provides a compelling connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.

arXiv:2411.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map the complete classical phase diagram of the spin Hamiltonian describing pyrochlore rare-earth magnets with all symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor bond-dependent anisotropic two-spin interactions. We provide a simple derivation of the organization of spins into tensor degrees of freedom describing the multipole moments of a tetrahedron, whose components correspond to irreducible representations (irreps) of the tetrahedral symmetry group $T_d$. By parameterizing the Hamiltonian directly in terms of the energies of the individual irreps, we perform an exhaustive search of all possible irrep degeneracies which may host stable classical spin liquids. Doing so reveals four one-parameter families of models along which three phases are degenerate, all four of which merge at the Heisenberg antiferromagnet and its dual, and we give a complete three-dimensional picture of the phase diagram showing all of the phases and their intersections. The appearance of two copies of a single irrep implies an extra degenerate locus which pierces the phase boundaries at special points, yielding two additional isolated triple points. We demonstrate that one-parameter families of Hamiltonians are characterized by a topological invariant describing how the ground state spin configuration winds when adiabatically transported around this degenerate locus, analogous to a "diabolical locus". We provide a comprehensive catalog of all flat band degeneracies in the phase diagram and discuss the mechanisms that may allow for or impede the realization of a variety of classical spin liquids described by tensor gauge fields exhibiting pinch line singularities and concomitant four-fold pinch points. Lastly, we provide a list of all cases where three irreps are degenerate above the ground state, which may lead to interesting features in the spin wave spectrum within each ordered phase.

# Intrinsic inverse band gap versus polarization relation in ferroelectric materials

## 铁电材料中的本征反带隙与极化关系

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03462

arXiv:2411.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials have promising applications in solar-energy conversion and electro-optic devices. The internal gradient fields produced by the macroscopic polarization may improve electronic and transport semiconducting properties. However, ferroelectrics tend to display relatively large band gaps and hence low solar-energy conversion efficiencies. In this work, we explore materials with an intrinsic inverse relation between band gap and polarization in a single ferroelectric phase. Ferroelectrics with an inverse band gap versus polarization relation are characterized by low density of states contribution at the conduction states and negligible orbital hybridization at the valence states. We use high-throughput and first principles methods to find 11 ferroelectric materials with an inverse band gap versus polarization relation in the Materials Project database. Our work provides a new pathway to design small-band gap large-polarization ferroelectrics, by simultaneously tailoring the band gap and polarization of ferroelectrics with an inverse relation through an external tuning parameter.

# Theory of unconventional magnetism in a Cu-based kagome metal

## 铜基kagome金属中的非常规磁性理论

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03563

arXiv:2411.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals have established a new arena for correlated electron physics. To date, the predominant experimental evidence centers around unconventional charge order, nematicity, and superconductivity, while magnetic fluctuations due to electronic interactions, i.e., beyond local atomic magnetism, have largely been elusive. From ab initio design and many-body analysis, we develop a model framework of Cu-based kagome materials the simulations of which reveal unconventional magnetic order in a kagome metal. We find the challenge of locating the appropriate parameter regime for such exotic order to center around two aspects. First, the correlations implied by low-energy orbitals have to be sufficiently large to yield a dominance of magnetic fluctuations and weak to retain an itinerant parent state. Second, the kinematic kagome profile at the Fermi level demands an efficient mitigation of sublattice interference causing the suppression of magnetic fluctuations descending from electronic onsite repulsion. We elucidate our methodology by analyzing the proposed compound CsCu$_3$Cl$_5$, assessing its feasibility for future material synthesis.

Abstract: Rare earth intermetallic compounds crystallized in AlB$_2$-type and its low-symmetry derivative CeCu$_2$-type structures potentially host diverse frustrated magnetic structures and rich magnetotransport phenomena. We report the film growth of CeCu$_2$-type EuZn$_2$ by molecular beam epitaxy and the observation of topological Hall responses highly contrastive to isostructural EuCd$_2$. While their magnetization curves are rather similar, the topological Hall effect observed in EuZn$_2$ is simpler, with the only one component enhanced at the magnetic transition field. EuZn$_2$ may be a unique system for studying the magnetic domain boundary effect on topological Hall responses among the CeCu$_2$-type rare-earth intermetallic compounds.

# A Predictive First-Principles Framework of Chiral Charge Density Waves

## 手性电荷密度波的预测第一性原理框架

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03664

arXiv:2411.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing and tuning chirality is fundamental in physics, chemistry, and material science. Chiral charge density waves (CDWs), where chirality arises from correlated charge orders, are attracting intense interest due to their exotic transport and optical properties. However, a general framework for predicting chiral CDW materials is lacking, primarily because the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we address this challenge by developing the first comprehensive predictive framework, systematically identifying chiral CDW materials via first-principles calculations. The key lies in the previously overlooked phase difference of the CDW Q-vectors between layers, which is linked to opposite collective atomic displacements across different layers. This phase difference induces a spiral arrangement of the Q-vectors, ultimately giving rise to a chiral structure in real space. We validate our framework by applying it to the kagome lattice AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), successfully predicting emergent structural chirality. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we extend it to predict chiral CDWs in the triangular-lattice NbSe$_{2}$. Beyond material predictions, our theory uncovers a universal and unprecedented Hall effect in chiral CDW materials, occurring without external magnetic fields or intrinsic magnetization. Our experiments on CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ confirm this prediction, observing a unique signature where the Hall conductivity's sign reverses when the input current is reversed, a phenomenon distinct from known Hall effects. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms behind chiral CDWs and open new avenues for discovering materials with unconventional quantum properties, with potential applications in next-generation electronic and spintronic devices.

# Scalar Spin Chirality Hall Effect

## 标量自旋手性霍尔效应

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03679

arXiv:2411.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar spin chirality, which characterizes the fundamental unit of noncoplanar spin structures, plays an important role in rich chiral physics of magnetic materials. In particular, the intensive research efforts over the past two decades have demonstrated that the scalar spin chirality is the source of various novel Hall transports in solid-state systems, offering a primary route to bring about chiral phenomena in condensed matter physics. However, in all of the previous studies, the scalar spin chirality has been given as a stationary background, serving only a passive role in the transport properties of materials. It remains an open question whether or not the scalar spin chirality itself can exhibit a Hall-type transport. In this work, we show that the answer is yes: The scalar spin chirality is Hall-transported in Kagome ferromagnets and antiferromagnets under an external bias, engendering a phenomenon which we dub the scalar spin chirality Hall effect. Notably, this effect is present even in the absence of any spin-orbit coupling. The analytical theory for the scalar spin chirality Hall effect is corroborated by atomistic spin simulations. Our findings call for the need to lift the conventional assumption that the scalar spin chirality is a passive background in order to discover the active roles of the scalar spin chirality in transport properties.

Abstract: In this work we study a system of interacting fermions on a triangular lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We neglect spin and fix a density of one third, with one unit of magnetic flux per particle. The infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) algorithm is used to compute the ground state of this generalized Fermi-Hubbard model. Increasing the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion, we find a first order transition between an Integer Quantum Hall phase and a crystalline, generalized Wigner crystal state. The first-order nature of the phase transition is consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau argument. We expect our results to be relevant for moir\'e heterostructures of two-dimensional materials.

# Magnetic order induced truly chiral phonons in a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal

## 铁磁Weyl半金属中的磁序诱导的真正手性声子

arXiv:2411.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral phonons are vibrational modes in a crystal that possess a well-defined handedness or chirality, typically found in materials that lack inversion symmetry. Here we report the discovery of truly chiral phonon modes in the kagome ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2, a material that preserves inversion symmetry but breaks time-reversal symmetry. Using helicity-resolved magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we observe the spontaneous splitting of the doubly degenerate in-plane Eg modes into two distinct chiral phonon modes of opposite helicity when the sample is zero-field cooled below the Curie temperature, without the application of an external magnetic field. As we sweep the out-of-plane magnetic field, this Eg phonon splitting exhibits a well-defined hysteresis loop directly correlated with the material's magnetization. The observed spontaneous splitting reaches up to 1.27 cm-1 at low temperatures and diminishes with increasing temperature, ultimately vanishing at the Curie temperature. Our findings highlight the role of the magnetic order in inducing chiral phonons, paving the way for novel methods to manipulate chiral phonons through magnetization and vice versa. Additionally, our work introduces new possibilities for controlling chiral Weyl fermions using chiral phonons.

In absence of magnetic fields, previous studies show that there are different conformations of the nanobridge, depending on the slit pore width $D$ and the wettability of the walls. Under the application of uniform magnetic field cycles, in which the intensity of the field is increased stepwise until a maximum value and then decreased at the same rate, switching between different nanobridge conformations can be observed if the magnetic field is applied in a perpendicular direction to the global nematic director of the nanobridge. However, there are situations in which the initial bridge conformation is recovered after the magnetic field application, indicating that the switching can only be observed if there are different locally stable nanobridge conformations under the same thermodynamic conditions. Moreover, magnetic fields can destabilize the nanobridge, leading to its breakdown into isolated nanodroplets attached to a single wall.

Abstract: We analytically explore the dynamics of a charged active particle coupled to two thermal baths kept at two different temperatures in two dimensions. The particle is confined to an asymmetric harmonic potential and a magnetic field of constant magnitude is applied perpendicular to the plane of motion of the particle. For such a system, as opposed to Brownian gyrator, the potential asymmetry and temperature gradient are not the key factors for the gyration, as long as finite activity and magnetic field are present. The system shows only a paramagnetic behavior in the absence of either potential asymmetry or temperature gradient. However, by tuning the temperature gradient or potential asymmetry, the system as a function of the duration of activity can exhibit paramagnetic, diamagnetic, or co-existence of both the phases. Interestingly, the magnetic moment vanishes for parameters for which the system possesses a non-equilibrium steady state and hence, a magnetic transition is observed through these non-magnetic points. Further, when the system is suspended in a viscoelastic medium characterized by a finite memory, it exhibits a magnetic transition in the activity-memory parameter space through a non-magnetic line. This non-magnetic line is sensitive to temperature gradient and potential asymmetry. It interestingly forms a closed loop with a diamagnetic phase inside the loop and the entire regime outside as paramagnetic. This results in the emergence of a trapped diamagnetic phase existing only within a finite regime of activity-memory parameter space. This phase eventually disappears as the temperature gradient increases (or decreases) depending on the sign of the potential asymmetry. Moreover, it is observed that by tuning the system parameters, one can obtain zero magnetic moment even for parameter ranges that defy the equilibrium condition of the system.

# Ultra-fast spin Hall nano-oscillator based microwave spectral analysis

arXiv:2411.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-fast spectrum analysis concept based on rapidly tuned spintronic nano-oscillators has been under development for the last few years and has already demonstrated promising results. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-fast microwave spectrum analyzer based on a chain of five mutually synchronized nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). As mutual synchronization affords the chain a much improved signal quality, with linewidths well below 1 MHz at close to a 10 GHz operating frequency, we observe an order of magnitude better frequency resolution bandwidth compared to previously reported spectral analysis based on single magnetic tunnel junction based spin torque nano-oscillators. The high-frequency operation and ability to synchronize long SHNO chains and large arrays make SHNOs ideal candidates for ultra-fast microwave spectral analysis.

Abstract: Chiral phonons are desirable for applications in spintronics but their generation and control remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate the emergence of truly chiral phonons from selective magnon-phonon coupling in inversion-symmetric magnetic systems. Considering bcc Fe as example, we quantitatively calculate hybridized magnon-phonon quasiparticle states across the entire Brillouin zone utilizing first-principles calculations. Our findings challenge conventional magneto-elastic interpretations and reveal finite zero-point phonon angular momentum and strong anomalous Hall responses linked to finite (spin) Berry curvatures. Our results further establish that the existence of chiral phonons, particularly along high-symmetry directions, is common in many magnetic materials, offering promising avenues for novel spintronic and phononic devices.

# Discretizing the Bistability of Mode-Locked Electron Spin Precession: An Overhauser Field Hysteresis Manifestation

arXiv:2411.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-nuclear spin interactions by pulsed optical pumping have been found to polarize the nuclear spin system, leading to the nuclei building up an intrinsic magnetic field known as the Overhauser field. Studies have indicated an Overhauser field hysteresis effect dependent on the sweep direction of an externally applied magnetic field in negatively detuned periodically pumped Si-doped GaAs. Although predictions of bistable mode-locked electron spin precession frequency modes have been made for systems exhibiting this hysteresis, there have been no reports on the experimental observation of said bistable spin precession modes. This letter details the evolution of bistable Overhauser field solutions leading to a hysteretic effect in negatively detuned optical excitation of Si-doped GaAs by magneto-optic pump-probe spectroscopy and investigates the resulting consequence of this hysteresis acting on the electron spin system. One manifestation of the Overhauser field hysteresis acting on the electron spin system leads to the discretization of bistable mode-locked electron spin precession modes within a given band of externally applied magnetic field. A method for preferentially accessing the two different and stable mode-locked spin precession modes within a given band of externally applied magnetic field is outlined, which may be of interest for communities utilizing electron and nuclear spins for information processing protocols.

arXiv:2411.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective modes are coherent excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), and their study provides insight into the macroscopic quantum phenomena that govern these systems. Collective mode frequencies can be used to probe the properties of BECs, such as the trap geometry, the interatomic interactions, and the presence of defects; hence, it is essential to develop methods for high-resolution determination of collective mode frequencies. A standard technique consists of a single pulse of an external oscillatory field, which we denote Rabi-like due to the analogy with the field of nuclear magnetic resonances. In this work, we propose a method to achieve a better resolution than the Rabi-like protocol, which consists of two oscillating fields separated in time, which we call Ramsey-like. We focus on BECs in harmonic traps, considering mainly the quadrupole and breathing modes for different trap anisotropy values and comparing the results using single and double excitation zones. First, we employ a variational approach with a Thomas-Fermi ansatz, which gives rise to dynamical equations that are numerically solved. Then, we modeled the problem as a three-level system, offering a concise and alternative description of the same dynamics, enabling the idea of coherent control of these collective modes. Both approaches show that the Ramsey-like protocol provides a better resolution than the Rabi-like. This offers the possibility of measuring collective mode frequencies with higher precision, which is important in experiments where they are used as indirect measurements of properties that are difficult to probe.

arXiv:2411.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, by applying a comprehensive approach including magnetic, transport measurements, ARPES band structure measurements, DFT calculations, and analytical theory consideration, we unveil the puzzling origin of the negative isotropic magnetoresistance in the highly anisotropic semimetals, particularly, Eu$_2$Sn$_2$As$_2$ with AFM ordering of Eu atoms. The isotropic magnetoresistance developing along with the magnetization changes up to the complete spin polarization field was reported previously in several experimental studies, though its theoretical explanation was missing up to date. Recently, we proposed a novel theoretical mechanism to describe the observed magnetoresistance in layered AFM compounds by exchange splitting of the electron energy levels and by confining the electron wave functions with different spin projection in the vicinity of the respective magnetic layer. In this paper, we present more detailed experimental studies of the negative magnetoresistance with several samples of EuSn$_2$As$_2$ in order to identify its sample-independent features including temperature dependence. We also substantiate the proposed theory by comparing it with magnetotransport data, with ARPES measurements of the energy band structure, and DFT energy spectrum calculations.

arXiv:2411.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of topologically non-trivial magnetic configurations has been a pivotal topic in both basic and applied nanomagnetism research. Localized non-coplanar magnetic defects such as skyrmions or merons were found to interact strongly with currents, making them interesting candidates for future spintronics applications. Here, we study a low-symmetry bcc(110) system by spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and an atomistic spin model using parameters obtained from first-principles calculations. We demonstrate how a delicate balance between energy terms generates both topologically trivial and non-trivial domain walls, depending on their crystallographic direction. The topological walls consist of merons and antimerons and the topological charge amounts to about 0.2/nm wall length. The incorporation of holes in the films facilitates the transition from an in-plane ferromagnetic ground state to a spin-spiral state. Both domain walls and spirals transition into isolated elongated magnetic skyrmions in applied magnetic fields, establishing low-symmetry systems as a versatile platform for spin-texture engineering.

# Characterization of Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametrons in the MIT LL SFQ5ee+ Process

## MIT LL SFQ5ee过程中绝热量子通量参数的表征

arXiv:2411.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic is a proven energy-efficient superconductor technology for various applications. To address the scalability challenges, we investigated AQFP shift registers with the AQFP footprint area reduced by 25% with respect to prior work and with more than 2x denser overall designs obtained by eliminating the previously used free space between the AQFPs. We also investigated AQFP cells with different designs of flux trapping moats in the superconducting ground plane as well as compact AQFP cells that took advantage of the smaller feature sizes available in the new fabrication process, SFQ5ee+, at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This new process features nine planarized Nb layers with a 0.25 $\mu$m minimum linewidth.
  The fabricated circuits were tested in a liquid He probe and in a closed-cycle cryocooler using a controlled cooling rate through the superconducting critical temperature. Using multiple thermal cycles, we investigated flux trapping in the dense AQFP shift registers as well as in the registers using the old (sparse) AQFP designs at two levels of the residual magnetic field, about 0.53 $\mu$T and about 1.2 $\mu$T. The sparse designs demonstrated 95% to almost 100% probability of operation after the cooldown and very wide operation margins, although the flux trapping probability was increasing with circuit complexities. The margins were similarly wide in the newer dense designs, but flux trapping probability that rendered the registers nonoperational was significantly, by an order of magnitude, higher in the denser circuits and was also very sensitive to the moats' shape and location.
  Our findings indicate that AQFP circuits are amendable to increasing the scale of integration and further densification, but a careful moat design and optimization are required to reduce flux trapping effects in the dense AQFP circuits.

arXiv:2411.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton condensation, the Bose-Einstein-like condensation of quasibosonic particle-hole pairs, has been the subject of much theoretical and experimental interest and holds promise for ultra-energy-efficient technologies. Recent advances in bilayer systems, such as transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, have brought us closer to the experimental realization of exciton condensation without the need for high magnetic fields. In this perspective, we explore progress towards understanding and realizing exciton condensation, with a particular focus on the characteristic theoretical signature of exciton condensation: an eigenvalue greater than one in the particle-hole reduced density matrix, which signifies off-diagonal long-range order. This metric bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental realizations by providing a unifying framework that connects exciton condensation to related phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation and superconductivity. Furthermore, our molecular approach integrates exciton condensation with broader excitonic phenomena, including exciton-related entanglement and correlation, unlocking potential advancements in fields like quantum materials and energy transport. We discuss connections between recent experimental and theoretical work and highlight the discoveries that may arise from approaching exciton condensation from a molecular perspective.

# Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04089

arXiv:2411.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.

arXiv:2411.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental detection of antiferromagnetic order in two-dimensional materials is a challenging task due to the absence of net dipole moments. Identifying multi-domain antiferromagnetic textures via the current techniques is even more difficult. In order to address this challenge, we investigate the higher order multipole moments in twisted bilayer MnPSe$_3$. While the monolayers of MnPSe$_3$ exhibit in-plane N\'eel antiferromagnetic order, our atomistic simulations indicate that the moir\'e superlattices display a two-domain phase on each layer. We show that the octupolar moments $M_{33}^+$ and $M_{33}^-$ are significant in this multi-domain phase at the domain walls. In addition, when $[M_{33}^+,M_{33}^-]$ are represented by the $x$ and $y$ components of a vector, the resultant pattern of these octupole moments winds around the antiferromagnetic domains and forms to vortex crystals which leads to octupolar toroidal moments, $T_{xyz}$ and $T_{z}^{\beta}$. $T_{xyz}$ and $T_{z}^{\beta}$ can give rise to a magnetoelectric effect and gyrotropic birefringence that may provide indirect ways of detecting multi-domain antiferromagnetic order. Our results highlight the importance of higher-order multipole moments for identification of complex spin textures in moir\'e magnets.

Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties that arise from the directional and multispectral nature of anisotropic materials, leading to numerous potential applications in photonics, biomedicine, and magnetism. Furthermore, anisotropic particles are ubiquitous in naturally occurring and existing systems such as ice and dust grains, liquid crystal droplets, and ferromagnetic particles, and they correspond to atoms in magnetic fields and anisotropic molecules. However, despite considerable effort, the complexity that they introduce to the theory has significantly limited their eigenmode analysis, hindering their understanding and broad applicability. Here we analytically derive the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of anisotropic spheres and ellipsoids. We show that anisotropic particles exhibit novel radiation patterns. In addition, we identify axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting in uniaxial and biaxial particles and eigenvalue degeneracy in uniaxial spheres. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers in unexplored spectral regions and apply to additional fields of physics such as magnetism, heat conduction, and atomic and molecular physics.

Abstract: We theoretically propose the electric field induced thermal Hall effect of triplons in the quantum dimer magnets $X$CuCl$_{3}$ ($X =$ Tl, K), which exhibit ferroelectricity in the Bose-Einstein condensation phase of triplons. The interplay between ferroelectricity and magnetism in these materials leads to the magnetoelectric effect, i.e., an electric-field induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction between spins on the same dimer. We argue that this intradimer DM interaction breaks the symmetry of the system in the absence of an electric field and gives rise to the thermal Hall effect, which can be detected in experimentally accessible electric and magnetic fields. We also show that the thermal Hall effect can be controlled by changing the strength or direction of the electric field.

Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated systems with incommensurate order poses significant challenges for traditional finite-size-based approaches. Confining such a phase to a finite-size geometry can induce spurious frustration, with spin spirals in frustrated magnets being a typical example. Here, we introduce an Ansatz based on infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) which overcomes these limitations and enables the direct search for the optimal spiral in the thermodynamic limit, with a computational cost that is independent of the spiral's wavelength. Leveraging this method, we simulate the Heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular lattice, which interpolates between the square and isotropic triangular lattice limits. Besides accurately reproducing the magnetically ordered phases with arbitrary wavelength, the simulations reveal a quantum spin liquid phase emerging between the N\'eel and spin spiral phases.

Abstract: Topological characteristics of quantum systems are typically determined by the closing of a gap, while the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) during quantum real-time evolution has emerged as a nonequilibrium analog to the quantum phase transition (QPT). In this paper, we illustrate that the system dynamics can be elucidated by considering the precession of a collection of free-pseudo spins under a magnetic field based on the exact results of extended Kitaev chains. The topology of the driven Hamiltonian is determined by the average winding number of the nonequilibrium state. Furthermore, we establish that the singularity of the DQPT arises from two perpendicular pseudo-spin vectors associated with the pre- and post-quenched Hamiltonians. Moreover, we investigate the distinct behaviors of the dynamic pairing order parameter in both topological and non-topological regions. These findings offer valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of topological superconductors, contributing to the understanding of the resilience of topological properties in driven quantum systems.

Abstract: Although iron-based single atom catalysts are regarded as a promising alternative to precious metal catalysts, their precise electronic structures during catalysis still pose challenges for computational descriptions. A particularly urgent question is the influence of the environment on the electronic structure, and how to describe this properly with computational methods. Here, we study an iron porphyrin chloride complex adsorbed on a graphene sheet using density functional theory calculations to probe how much the electronic structure is influenced by the presence of a graphene layer. Our results indicate that weak interactions due to van der Waals forces dominate between the porphyrin complex and graphene, and only a small amount of charge is transferred between the two entities. Furthermore, the interplay of the ligand field environment, strong $p$ $-$ $d$ hybridization, and correlation effects within the complex are strongly involved in determining the spin state of the iron ion. By bridging molecular chemistry and solid state physics, this study provides first steps towards a joint analysis of the properties of iron-based catalysts from first principles.

Abstract: The origin of the "hidden" quadrupolar and unconventional magnetic low-temperature orders observed in the spin-orbit double perovskite Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ defies explanation through standard experimental and theoretical techniques. Here we address this problem by deriving and solving an ab initio low-temperature effective Hamiltonian including inter-site electronic exchange and vibronic (electron-lattice) couplings between $J_{eff}=3/2$ Jahn-Teller-active Rhenium states. Our findings disclose the nature of these elusive states, attributing it to intertwined exchange and electron-lattice couplings, thus diverging from the conventional dichotomy of purely electronic or lattice driving mechanisms. Our results indicate the resilience of the quadrupolar hidden order under pressure, yet its rapid suppression under uniaxial strain suggests that external or lattice-induced distortions play a pivotal role in determining the relative stability of competing phases in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and similar $d^1$ double perovskites.

Abstract: According to x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, PbTiO$_3$ undergoes a phase transition from a tetragonal ferroelectric (FE) phase to a cubic paraelectric phase at 763 K. However, x-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurements indicate that PbTiO$_3$ is locally tetragonal even after the phase transition. The difference in these results is because XAFS measurements can probe local features of a structure, while XRD averages over such local features. For both measurements to be consistent, PbTiO$_3$ is macroscopically cubic but locally tetragonal after the phase transition. Despite this, most models, such as the Laundau-Ginsburg-Devonshire theory and effective Hamiltonians, are still unable to explain this phenomenon. Moreover, these methods involve model parameters fitted to experimental or theoretical data and do not consider other tetragonal configurations, such as domain walls, to predict the phase transition. In our previous study, we used our zentropy approach to predict the phase transition by considering the tetragonal FE ground-state configuration and the tetragonal 90{\deg} and 180{\deg} domain wall configurations with their total energies at 0 K. In this paper, the Helmholtz energies of the three configurations are obtained from density functional theory calculations through energy-volume curves and phonon calculations. The predicted phase transition temperature using the meta-GGA $r^2\text{SCAN}$ and revised multiplicities of configurations is 716 K, showing good agreement with the experimental value of 763 K.

Abstract: Kondo lattice systems are recognized for potentially hosting a variety of rich topological phases. Several pioneering studies have demonstrated significant anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects in these systems, attributed to the Berry curvature of the hybridization bands. In this study, we investigate UBiTe, a ferromagnetic Kondo lattice system. Our findings reveal that the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity is closely tied to the Kondo coherence temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate that slight shifts in the Fermi level across three different samples significantly influence this intrinsic contribution, in alignment with the Berry curvature localized within the narrow hybridization bands. This provides a stark contrast to the less pronounced sensitivity observed in weakly correlated Weyl semimetals, underscoring the distinctive electronic properties of Kondo lattice systems. The anomalous Hall conductivity of one samples ranks among the highest reported for topological magnetic materials.

# Magnetic Force Microscopy: High Quality-Factor Two-Pass Mode

Abstract: Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) is a well-established technique in scanning probe microscopy that allows for the imaging of magnetic samples with a spatial resolution of tens of nm and stray fields down to the mT range. The spatial resolution and field sensitivity can be significantly improved by measuring in vacuum conditions. This improvement originates from the higher quality-factor (Q-factor) of the cantilever's oscillation in vacuum compared to ambient conditions. However, while high Q-factors are desirable as they directly enhance the magnetic measurement signal, they pose a challenge when performing standard MFM two-pass (lift) mode measurements. At high Q-factors, amplitude-based topography measurements become impossible, and the MFM phase response behaves non-linearly. Here, we present a modified two-pass mode implementation in a vacuum atomic force microscope (AFM) that addresses these issues. By controlling the Q-factor in the first pass and using a phase-locked loop (PLL) technique in the second pass, high Q-factor measurements in vacuum are enabled. Measuring the cantilever's frequency shift instead of the phase shift eliminates the issue of emerging nonlinearities. The improvements in MFM signal-to-noise ratio are demonstrated using a nano-patterned magnetic sample. The elimination of non-linear response is highlighted through measurements performed on a well-characterized multilayer reference sample. Finally, we discuss a technique that avoids topography-induced artifacts by following the average sample slope. The newly developed, sensitive, and distortion-free high quality-factor two-pass mode has the potential to be widely implemented in commercial setups, facilitating high-resolution MFM measurements and advancing studies of modern magnetic materials.

Abstract: The concept of spin symmetries has gained renewed interest as a valuable tool for classifying novel magnetic phases, including altermagnets and recently identified unconventional p-wave magnets. In this work, we show that in certain cases, the photoresponse is determined by spin group rather than the conventional magnetic group symmetry, a finding with implications for compounds with weak spin-orbit coupling. As a concrete realization we consider the nonlinear shift photocurrent in Mn$_5$Si$_3$, a material that features the two possible classes of unconventional p-wave magnetism in the form of two competing spin structures, a coplanar and non-coplanar one. While both are predicted to generate shift currents based on magnetic symmetry considerations, only the non-coplanar configuration survives the spin symmetry requirements. This is numerically confirmed by our $\textit{ab-initio}$ calculations, providing a protocol to experimentally identify the spin configuration of this promising material via linear photogalvanic measurements.

Abstract: Quantum transport studies of spin-dependent phenomena in solids commonly employ the Kubo or Keldysh formulas for the nonequilibrium density operator in the steady-state linear-response regime. Its trace with operators of interest, such as the spin density, spin current density, etc., gives expectation values of experimentally accessible observables. For local quantities, these formulas require summing over the manifolds of {\em both} Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea states. However, debates have been raging in the literature about the vastly different physics the two formulations can apparently produce, even when applied to the same system. Here, we revisit this problem using infinite-size graphene with proximity-induced spin-orbit and magnetic exchange effects as a testbed. By splitting this system into semi-infinite leads and central active region, in the spirit of Landauer formulation of quantum transport, we prove the {\em numerically exact equivalence} of the Kubo and Keldysh approaches via the computation of spin Hall current density and spin-orbit torque in both clean and disordered limits. The key to reconciling the two approaches are the numerical frameworks we develop for: ({\em i}) evaluation of Kubo(-Bastin) formula for a system attached to semi-infinite leads, which ensures continuous energy spectrum and evades the need for commonly used phenomenological broadening introducing ambiguity; and ({\em ii}) proper evaluation of Fermi-sea term in the Keldysh approach, which {\em must} include the voltage drop across the central active region even if it is disorder free.

Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets has opened up new possibilities for miniaturizing spintronic devices to the monolayer limit. 2D half-metals, capable of conducting fully spin-polarized currents when spin-orbit coupling is minimal, provide a key advantage in improving device performance. Extensive theoretical research has been carried out to discover 2D half-metals, yet their realization remains elusive. Here we report the bottom-up synthesis of superatomic graphene and the demonstration of its half-metallic properties. The produced graphene half-metal is fabricated through an on-surface synthetic approach with phosphorus-doped triangulene as its building block. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements reveal its metallic band structures and identify its ferromagnetism through magnon excitation under varying magnetic fields. Density functional theory simulations accurately capture its half-metallic characteristics, uncovering the origin of spin-polarized bands from the p$_x,_y$-like orbital of superatomic graphene. Our work demonstrates intrinsic 2D carbon magnetism, paving the way for harnessing its advantages in spintronics.

Abstract: The effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model represents a universality class of quantum hydrodynamic fluids in one spatial dimension. It describes quantum compressible fluids involving both chiralities in which the chiral density field obeys the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation. An extension of this theory to describe a laminar flow of the Calogero-Sutherland fluids in a rectangular geometry with small transverse width and the topology of a ribbon, is considered here. The physical picture is based on the edge states in the hierarchical quantum Hall effect, which may be seen as a collection of parallel one-dimensional quantum incompressible fluids moving along but confined within the transverse microscopic width of the edge of the sample. The effective theory is thus defined as the direct product of two one-dimensional theories of the Calogero-Sutherland class so that one involves motion while the other is confining. Charge transport may be induced by coupling the system to an external electromagnetic field that yields a global translation of the ground state. The effective theory describes quantum solitonic excitations along the direction of the flow and possesses a two-dimensional electric current density which shows a Wigner semicircle law profile in the transverse direction, suggesting a Poiseuille-like behavior but without dissipative viscous effects since the velocity of the fluid is not a well-defined quantum field. This simple physical picture predicts interesting phenomena with distinctive signatures that may be tested in real samples.

Abstract: We investigate collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators (TIs) and their impact on particle axion detection. In the three-dimensional TI model with the Hubbard term, the effective action of magnons and amplitude modes is formulated by dynamical susceptibility under the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. One of the amplitude modes is identified as ``axionic'' quasi-particle and its effective coupling to the electromagnetic fields turns out to be enhanced by about four orders of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, which may drastically change the sensitivity of the particle axion search using ``axion'' in magnetic TIs.

Abstract: Topology is the study of geometrical properties and spatial relations unaffected by continuous changes, and has become an important tool for understanding complex physical systems. Although recent optical experiments have inferred the existence of vector fields with the topologies of merons, the inability to extract the full three dimensional vectors misses a richer set of topologies that have not yet been fully explored. In our work, we extend the study of the topology of electromagnetic fields on surfaces to a spin quasi-particle with the topology of a meron pair, formed by interfering surface plasmon polaritons, and show that the in-plane vectors are constrained by the embedding topology of the space as dictated by the Poincare-Hopf theorem. In addition we explore the time evolution of the three dimensional topology of the spin field formed by femtosecond laser pulses. These experiments are possible using our here developed method called polarimetric photoemission electron microscopy (polarimetric PEEM) that combines an optical pump-probe technique and polarimetry with photo-emission electron microscopy. This method allows for the accurate generation of surface plasmon polariton fields and their subsequent measurement, revealing both the spatial distribution of the full three-dimensional electromagnetic fields at deep sub-wavelength resolution and their time evolution.

Abstract: The PICOSEC-Micromegas (PICOSEC-MM) detector is a novel gaseous detector designed for precise timing resolution in experimental measurements. It eliminates time jitter from charged particles in ionization gaps by using extreme UV Cherenkov light emitted in a crystal, detected by a Micromegas photodetector with an appropriate photocathode. The first single-channel prototype tested in 150 GeV/c muon beams achieved a timing resolution below 25 ps, a significant improvement compared to standard Micropattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs). This work explores the specifications for applying these detectors in monitored neutrino beams for the ENUBET Project. Key aspects include exploring resistive technologies, resilient photocathodes, and scalable electronics. New 7-pad resistive detectors are designed to handle the particle flux. In this paper, two potential scenarios are briefly considered: tagging electromagnetic showers with a timing resolution below 30 ps in an electromagnetic calorimeter as well as individual particles (mainly muons) with about 20 ps respectively.

arXiv:2411.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of van der Waals heterostructures with an interlayer twist, known as "twistronics", has been instrumental in advancing contemporary condensed matter research. Most importantly, it has underpinned the emergence of a multitude of strongly-correlated phases, many of which derive from the topology of the physical system. Here, we explore the application of the twistronics paradigm in plasmonic systems with nontrivial topology, by creating a moir\'e skyrmion superlattice using two superimposed plasmonic skyrmion lattices, twisted at a "magic" angle. The complex electric field distribution of the moir\'e skyrmion superlattice is measured using time-resolved vector microscopy, revealing that each super-cell possesses very large topological invariants and harbors a "skyrmion bag", the size of which is controllable by the twist angle and center of rotation. Our work shows how twistronics leads to a diversity of topological features in optical fields, providing a new route to locally manipulate electromagnetic field distributions, which is crucial for future structured light-matter interaction.

arXiv:2411.03249v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permanent magnet array (PMA) is a popular option to provide the main magnetic field in a dedicated portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system because it does not need power or a cooling system and has a much stronger field strength compared to a resistive magnet. Aside from the popular Halbach array that has a transversal field direction, the Inward-Outward ring (IO ring) array is a promising candidate that offers a longitudinal field direction with various design and engineering possibilities. In this article, a thorough study of IO ring arrays is conducted by examining the relation between the design parameters and its field patterns, its variants that lead to different applications and their properties. A detailed comparison between an IO ring array and Halbach array was conducted and reported. Moreover, the feasibility of building an IO ring array in a lab is demonstrated. The investigations strongly indicate that IO ring is a promising candidate that can offer high and homogeneous fields or a desired field pattern to portable MRI systems. With a longitudinal field direction, an IO ring array opens up opportunities to adopt MRI advanced technology and techniques in a portable system to improve image quality and shorten scan time.

# Hot Electron-Driven Structural Expansion and Magnetic Collapse in Bilayer FeSe

arXiv:2411.02443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena emerging from the interaction of light and matter in low-dimensional systems hold great potential for future quantum technologies. Here, using first-principles calculations incorporating non-local van der Waals interactions and Hubbard corrections, we report simultaneous structural expansion and magnetic collapse in bilayer FeSe induced by photoexcited hot electrons. Our calculations reveal that, while bulk FeSe is paramagnetic, as observed experimentally, double-layer FeSe exhibits robust {\it staggered} antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures with a net site magnetization of $\sim 2.75~\mu_B$/Fe. However, increasing the density of photoexcited electrons systematically enhances the internal electronic entropy, leading to a complete collapse of antiferromagnetic order accompanied by an abrupt expansion of the interlayer separation. Our findings suggest the structural and magnetic properties of FeSe thin films can be finely tuned via ultrafast laser excitation, offering a pathway to control quantum phases in iron-based compounds through electronic temperature.

# X-ray and Spectral UV Observations of Periodic Pulsations in a Solar Flare Fan/Looptop

Abstract: We present simultaneous X-ray and spectral ultraviolet (UV) observations of strikingly-coherent oscillations in emission from a coronal looptop and fan structure, during the impulsive phase of a long-duration M-class solar flare. The 50 s oscillations are observed near in-phase by Solar Orbiter/STIX, GOES, and IRIS Fe XXI intensity, Doppler and non-thermal velocity. For over 5 minutes of their approximate 35 minute duration, the oscillations are so periodic (2-sigma above the power law background), that they are better described as 'periodic pulsations' than the more-widely documented 'quasi-periodic pulsations' often observed during solar flares. By combining time-series analysis of the the multi-instrument datasets with comparison to MHD simulations, we attribute the oscillations to the magnetic tuning fork in the flare looptop-fan region, and betatron acceleration within the lower-altitude flare loops. These interpretations are possible due to the introduced 'Sliding Raster Method' (SliRM) for analysis of slit spectrometer (e.g. IRIS) raster data, to increase the temporal cadence of the observations at the expense of spatial information.

# Reconfigurable SWCNT ferroelectric field-effect transistor arrays

## 可重构SWCNT铁电场效应晶体管阵列

arXiv:2411.03198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable devices have garnered significant attention for alleviating the scaling requirements of conventional CMOS technology, as they require fewer components to construct circuits with similar function. Prior works required continuous voltage application for programming gate terminal(s) in addition to the primary gate terminal, which undermines the advantages of reconfigurable devices in realizing compact and power-efficient integrated circuits. Here, we realize reconfigurable devices based on a single-gate field-effect transistor (FET) architecture by integrating semiconducting channels consisting of a monolayer film of highly aligned SWCNTs with a ferroelectric AlScN gate dielectric, all compatible with CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing. We demonstrated these SWCNT ferroelectric FETs (FeFETs) in a centimeter-scale array (~1 cm^2) comprising ~735 devices, with high spatial uniformity in device characteristics across the array. The devices exhibited ambipolar transfer characteristics with high on-state currents and current on/off ratios exceeding 10^5, demonstrating an excellent balance between electron and hole conduction (~270 {\mu}A/{\mu}m at a drain voltage of 3 V. When functioning as a non-volatile memory, the SWCNT FeFETs demonstrated large memory windows of 0.26 V/nm and 0.08 V/nm in the hole and electron conduction regions, respectively, combined with excellent retention behavior for up to 10^4 s. Repeated reconfiguration between p-FET and n-FET modes was also enabled by switching the spontaneous polarization in AlScN and operating the transistor within a voltage range below the coercive voltage. We revealed through circuit simulations that reconfigurable SWCNT transistors can realize ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) with far fewer devices compared to circuits based on silicon CMOS technology or based on resistive non-volatile devices.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance is a prime method for the study of chemical and biological structures and their dynamical processes. The interpretation of these experiments relies on considering the spin of electrons as the sole relevant degree of freedom. By applying ab inito open quantum systems theory to the full electronic wavefunction, here we show that contrary to this widespread framework the thermalization of the unpaired electron spin of two Cr(V) coordination compounds is driven by virtual transitions to excited states with energy higher than 20,000 cm$^{-1}$ instead of solely involving low-energy spin interactions such as Zeeman and hyperfine ones. Moreover, we found that a window of low-energy THz phonons contributes to thermalization, rather than a small number of high-energy vibrations. This work provides a drastic reinterpretation of relaxation in spin-1/2 systems and its chemical control strategies, and ultimately exemplifies the urgency of further advancing an ab initio approach to relaxometry.

# New Bounds on Spherical Antenna Bandwidth and Directivity: Updates to the Chu-Harrington Limits

Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large spherical radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit has limitations in predicting bandwidth. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n>ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.

# Poynting flux transport channels formed in polar cap regions of neutron star magnetospheres

arXiv:2405.20866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair cascades in polar cap regions of neutron stars are considered to be an essential process in various models of coherent radio emissions of pulsars. The cascades produce pair plasma bunch discharges in quasi-periodic spark events. The cascade properties, and therefore also the coherent radiation, depend strongly on the magnetospheric plasma properties and vary significantly across and along the polar cap. Importantly, where the radio emission emanates from in the polar cap region is still uncertain.
  We investigate the generation of electromagnetic waves by pair cascades and their propagation in the polar cap for three representative inclination angles of a magnetic dipole, $0^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. We use two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations that include quantum-electrodynamic pair cascades in a charge-limited flow from the star surface.
  We find that the discharge properties are strongly dependent on the magnetospheric current profile in the polar cap and that transport channels for high intensity Poynting flux are formed along magnetic field lines where the magnetospheric currents approach zero and where the plasma cannot carry the magnetospheric currents. There, the parallel Poynting flux component is efficiently transported away from the star and may eventually escape the magnetosphere as coherent radio waves. The Poynting flux decreases with increasing distance from the star in regions of high magnetospheric currents.
  Our model shows that no process of energy conversion from particles to waves is necessary for the coherent radio wave emission. Moreover, the pulsar radio beam does not have a cone structure; rather, the radiation generated by the oscillating electric gap fields directly escapes along open magnetic field lines in which no pair creation occurs.

# Dissolution-DNP enables the detection of 13C hyperpolarized NMR spectra of Li-ion battery electrolytes

## 溶解-DNP可以检测锂离子电池电解质的13C超极化NMR光谱

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-8gvxg?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (dDNP) is a powerful hyperpolarization technique enabling sensitivity gains beyond four orders of magnitude in solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Over the last decades, researchers’ efforts have led to an extension of dDNP applications in fields such as imaging, metabolomics, and drug discovery. 
Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most widespread types of rechargeable batteries, which calls for a deeper understanding of the various physicochemical mechanisms involved in making them more efficient, safe, and sustainable. One of the key challenges lies in better understanding and limiting the degradation of the battery electrolyte, which can significantly impact the battery’s performance. While NMR has been used in attempts to understand these mechanisms, notably by investigating the degradation products, the intrinsic lack of sensitivity of this technique, combined with the limited accessible volume of such compounds, makes its application often challenging. 
In this work, we combine several state-of-the-art dDNP methodologies to acquire with high sensitivity solution 13C NMR spectra of battery electrolytes. We show that we can successfully detect hyperpolarized 13C signals on formulated battery electrolyte solutions on a 600 MHz spectrometer with sensitivity gains of up to 3 orders of magnitude. This work paves the way for studying lithium-ion battery electrolyte degradation under real usage conditions (cycling, thermal aging, air exposure…) with a 13C detection limit below the micromolar range. This methodology has the potential to provide new insights into degradation mechanisms and the role and effectiveness of additives to mitigate electrolyte degradation.

# Performance Enhancement and Energy Savings in Domestic Refrigeration Systems Using Al2O3/ZrO2 Nanoparticle with PAG Oil as a Hybrid Nano lubricant

## 使用Al2O3/ZrO2纳米颗粒和PAG油作为混合纳米润滑剂的家用制冷系统的性能增强和节能

This study focuses on performance enhancement and energy savings in domestic refrigeration systems using Al2O3/ZrO2 nanoparticles with PAG oil as a hybrid nanolubricant. Performance can be improved by lowering compressor power or increasing the evaporator's rate of heat absorption. Nanolubricants are known to enhance heat transfer, reduce compressor workload, and increase overall efficiency. In this study, R-600a refrigerant in a refrigeration system was evaluated using Al2O3/ZrO2 hybrid nanolubricant at (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 g/L) with 70 g of R-600a refrigerant. Key metrics are compressor power consumption, refrigeration effect, and Coefficient of Performance (COP). Compared to an R-600a system without nano lubricant, the hybrid nanoparticles increased cooling capacity by 5.94%, reduced compressor power consumption by 28.35%, and raised COP by 46.2%, from 3 to 4.05. The R-600a refrigerant is environmentally friendly and ozone-safe. Polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil was used as the lubricant, with nanoparticles dispersed via ultrasonication and magnetic stirring. Performance tests demonstrated significant improvements in COP, refrigeration effect, and power consumption with the hybrid nano lubricant. The results revealed that the Al2O3/ZrO2 hybrid nanolubricant significantly increased the system's cooling capacity and thermal efficiency.

# Exploring the Molecularity of Spices: The Gustatory Perspective

## 探索香料的分子性: 味觉视角

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5328323/latest

We explored electronic-structural features of molecules that elicit specific spice-taste-responses. The purpose of this work was to identify reproducible molecular fingerprints that might contribute to this taste. Our work informs us that these fingerprints go beyond gross and superficial molecular features such as aliphatic or aromatic systems, straight chains or rings, and specific functional groups. We explored these molecules down to the granularity of atom-pairs in structurally and chemically disparate molecules that produce the same taste response. These atom-pairs are not necessarily bonded. The atom-pairs have reproducible electronic-structural features even when they are in molecules that are superficially dissimilar. The electronic features were represented by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts&amp;mdash;that depict the electronic and chemical environments around an atom in the atom-pair. The structural features were represented by inter atomic (bonded or non-bonded) distances. We explored these fingerprints for 34 molecules whose tastes were identified by taste experts from TheGoodScentsCompany web resource. We identified atom-pairs that are likely responsible for specific spice-related tastes: spicy, herbal, woody, citrus, sweet, and minty, or combinations of these tastes which likely contribute to a spice&amp;rsquo;s unique flavor. For molecules clustered by similar tastes our results are consistent and independent of the overall structural and chemical nature of the molecule.

# Tuning of spin-transfer torque in VSe$_2$-based vdW magnetic tunnel junctions by electrode polytypes

## 基于VSe $_2 $ 的vdW磁隧道结中自旋转移矩的电极多型调谐

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5332567/latest

Inspired by the promising properties of monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$, known for its ferromagnetic ordering and Curie temperature above room temperature, we developed a 2D van der Waals heterostructure featuring VSe$_2$ as the ferromagnetic layer, flanked by non-magnetic TaS$_2$ electrodes and MoS$_2$ as the tunneling barrier. Using \emph{ab initio} quantum transport simulations within the nonequilibrium Green&rsquo;s function framework, we explored the impact of TaS$_2$ electrode polytypes on the device's quantum transport properties. Our results reveal that devices with 1T-TaS$_2$ electrodes exhibit higher spin-dependent transmission compared to 2H-TaS$_2$ electrodes. Incorporating MoS$_2$ enhances anisotropic tunnel magnetoresistance significantly, reaching 168\% for the 1T-device and 1419\% for the 2H-device, peaking when VSe$_2$ layers' magnetizations are antiparallel. Spin-transfer torque (STT) analysis shows that STT magnitude is highest at 90$^\circ$ ($-702~\mu$eV/V for 1T and $-1561~\mu$eV/V for 2H devices) and decreases towards 180$^\circ$. The 1T-device shows superior performance with lower Gilbert damping, reduced critical current density and voltage for magnetization switching, compared to the 2H-device, which requires significantly higher current and voltage. These findings underscore the potential of 1T-VSe$_2$-based heterostructures for advanced spintronic applications.&nbsp;
