Abstract: The antiferromagnetic quantum Hall insulator (AFQHI) where one of the spin components is in the quantum Hall state and the other in the trivial state is an established phase emerging as a result of the Hubbard repulsion in spinful quantum Hall systems. The stabilization of the AFQHI requires a charge order preventing the effect of the spin-flip transformation on the electronic state to be compensated by a space group operation, and is often induced via an ionic potential. While one would naively expect the nearest-neighbor (NN) density-density interaction favoring spontaneous charge order to result in qualitatively similar phenomena an analysis of the Haldane-Hubbard model extended by the NN interaction finds no AFQHI. Here, by considering an extended version of the Harper-Hofstadter-Hubbard model we go beyond the honeycomb structure and show that the realization of the AFQHI generically requires an explicit charge order and cannot be emerged through a spontaneous charge order. We unveil how the AFQHI disappears upon approaching from the explicit to the spontaneous charge ordering limit. Our findings shine more light on the stabilization conditions of the AFQHI which can guide the future optical lattice experiments searching for this intriguing magnetic topological insulator phase.

Abstract: Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR), wherein the characteristic resonant frequencies substantially exceed the QSS probing frequency, remains an open question. Here, using the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a QSS, we report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets up to frequencies of 24 GHz, significantly higher than the sensor's spin resonance frequency of 2.87 GHz. To achieve this, we leverage the enhancement of the QSS spin relaxation rate due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations that arise from collective late-time dynamics of finite-wavevector magnons excited by the driven uniform AFMR mode. Using optically detected AFMR, we first characterize the temperature and magnetic field dependence on the AFMR modes, which shed light on the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies. Second, we exploit the highly localized sensitivity of the QSS to demonstrate efficient magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency in fact increases with increasing frequency, enabling broadband detection of magnetization dynamics. Our work showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of both high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling magnetism in Neel states in antiferromagnets.

# Orbital-spin Locking and its Optical Signatures in Altermagnets

Abstract: Altermagnets, magnetic materials with zero magnetization and spin-split band structure, have gained tremendous attention recently for their rich physics and potential applications. Here, we report on a microscopic tight-binding model that unveils a unique coupling between orbitals and spins in $d$-wave altermagnets which gives rise to momentum-dependent and spin-selective optical absorption. This coupling promotes the controlled optical excitation of up or down spins depending on the polarization direction of linearly polarized light. Such an effect originates from the coupling of orbitals to the sublattice degree of freedom through the crystal field, which is then coupled to spins through the antiferromagnetic interaction. Our crystal field analysis, which is general to any type of altermagnet, helps understand the onset of altermagnetism from a microscopic point of view, and we use our results to propose clear magneto-optical signatures of our predictions. Our findings shine light on the interplay between orbitals and spins in altermagnets, thus paving the way towards novel orbitronic and opto-spintronic devices.

Abstract: Spin chirality in antiferromagnets offers new opportunities for spintronics. The kagome antiferromagnet Mn3Sn is a paradigmatic material in which the antiferromagnetic order parameter can be detected and controlled by electrical means. However, direct investigation of the magnetic texture of Mn3Sn has been challenging because of the tiny moment hosted in its magnetic octupole, hindering further clarification of this unique material. Here, we address this issue by observing the stray magnetic field from Mn3Sn using a diamond quantum scanning magnetometer. The spatially-resolved intrinsic domains and domain walls in a high-quality single-crystalline Mn3Sn film quantitatively reveal the polarization angle of the magnetic octupole in the kagome plane, the domain's local magnetization, the domain wall's width and chirality, and the octupole order in domain walls. Our nanoscale investigation of Mn3Sn, a powerful complement to macroscopic measurements, paves the road for developing chiral antiferromagnetism and its potential for spintronic applications.

# Spin polarization of the two-dimensional electron gas at the EuO/SrTiO$_3$ interface

## EuO/SrTiO$_3$ 界面处二维电子气的自旋极化

arXiv:2410.23804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are of particular interest for functional oxide electronics applications. The redox-created 2DEG residing on the strontium titanate, SrTiO$_3$ (STO), side of a europium monoxide (EuO)/SrTiO$_3$ (001) interface is expected to be significantly spin-polarized due to the proximity to the strong ($7\,\mu_B/f.u.$) Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO. We apply magnetic circular dichroism in the angular distribution (MCDAD) of photoemitted electrons to investigate whether and how the induced spin polarization of the 2DEG depends on the dimensionality of the overlaying EuO layer. The experimental data are complemented by density functional theory calculations with Hubbard $U$ term (DFT+$U$). We show that the EuO/STO interfacial 2DEG is spin-polarized even for ultrathin EuO overlayers, starting at an EuO threshold thickness of only two monolayers. Additional EuO monolayers even increase the induced magnetic Ti moment and thus the spin polarization of the 2DEG. Our results and the potential to enhance the magnetic order of EuO by other proximity effects [1] indicate that the EuO/STO (001) interface is an ideal template for creating (multi-)functional spin-polarized 2DEGs for application in oxide electronics.

Abstract: We study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice by using the two-dimensional density-matrix renormalization group method. Calculating the ground-state energy and spin structure factors, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model. As suggested by previous studies, we find a 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortex crystal phase, a nematic phase, a dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortex crystal phase (dual counterpart of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortex crystal phase), a $\mathbb{Z}_6$ ferromagnetic phase, and a dual ferromagnetic phase (dual counterpart of $\mathbb{Z}_6 $ ferromagnetic phase). Spin correlations discontinuously change at the phase boundaries because of first-order phase transitions. In the (dual) $\mathbb{Z}_6$ ferromagnetic phase, we find that the dominant spin component of the spin structure factors is different on either side of the SU(2) symmetric point, although there is no phase transition. Furthermore, we study the relation among von Neumann entanglement entropy, entanglement spectrum, and phase transitions of the model. We find that the Schmidt gap closes at the phase boundaries and thus the entanglement entropy clearly changes as well. This is different from the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, where the Schmidt gap and the entanglement entropy are not necessary a good measure of phase transitions.

Abstract: Special arrangements of atoms with more than one atom per unit cell, including honeycomb or kagome (woven bamboo mat) lattices, can host propagating excitations with non-trivial topology as defined by their evolution along closed paths in momentum space. Excitations on such lattices can also be momentum-independent, meaning that they are localized notwithstanding strong hopping of the underlying disturbances between neighbouring sites. The associated flat bands are interesting because the interactions between the heavy quasiparticles inhabiting them will become much more important than for strong dispersion, resulting in novel quantum solid and liquid states. Different stackings of two-dimensional lattices, for example twisted graphene bilayers, provide routes to further engineer topology and many-body effects. Here, we report the discovery, using circularly polarized x-rays for the unambiguous isolation of magnetic signals, of a nearly flat spin wave band and large (compared to elemental iron) orbital moment for the metallic ferromagnet Fe3Sn2, built from compact AB-stacked kagome bilayers and which has a topologically non-trivial electronic band structure controllable by modest external magnetic fields. As a function of out-of-plane momentum, the nearly flat optical mode and the global rotation symmetry-restoring acoustic mode are out of phase, consistent with a bilayer exchange coupling that is larger than the already large in-plane couplings. The defining units of this topological metal are therefore a triangular lattice of octahedral iron clusters rather than weakly coupled kagome planes. The spin waves are strongly damped when compared to elemental iron, opening the topic of interactions of topological bosons (spin waves) and fermions (electrons) with the very specific target of explaining boson lifetimes.

Abstract: As CMOS technologies face challenges in dimensional and voltage scaling, the demand for novel logic devices has never been greater, with spin-based devices offering scaling potential, at the cost of significantly high switching energies. Alternatively, magnetoelectric materials are predicted to enable low-power magnetization control, a solution with limited device-level results. Here, we demonstrate voltage-based magnetization switching and reading in nanodevices at room temperature, enabled by exchange coupling between multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ and ferromagnetic CoFe, for writing, and spin-to-charge current conversion between CoFe and Pt, for reading. We show that upon the electrical switching of the BiFeO$_3$, the magnetization of the CoFe can be reversed, giving rise to different voltage outputs. Through additional microscopy techniques, magnetization reversal is linked with the polarization state and antiferromagnetic cycloid propagation direction in the BiFeO$_3$. This study constitutes the building block for magnetoelectric spin-orbit logic, opening a new avenue for low-power beyond-CMOS technologies.

Abstract: We calculate the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ for the columnar valence-bond solid phase of a two-dimensional frustrated antiferromagnet. In particular, we consider the square lattice spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with an additional Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between the spins and in the presence of an external magnetic field. We concentrate on the intermediate parameter region of the $J_1$-$J_2$ model, where a quantum paramagnetic phase is stable, and consider a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector pattern associated with the couplings between the spins in the CuO$_2$ planes of the YBCO compound. We describe the columnar valence-bond solid phase within the bond-operator formalism, which allows us to map the Heisenberg model into an effective interacting boson model written in terms of triplet operators. The effective boson model is studied within the harmonic approximation and the triplon excitation bands of the columnar valence-bond solid phase is determined. We then calculate the Berry curvature and the Chern numbers of the triplon excitation bands and, finally, determine the thermal Hall conductivity due to triplons as a function of the temperature. We find that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction yields a finite Berry curvature for the triplon bands, but the corresponding Chern numbers vanish. Although the triplon excitations are topologically trivial, the thermal Hall conductivity of the columnar valence-bond solid phase in the square lattice antiferromagnet is finite at low temperatures. We comment on the relations of our results with a {\sl no-go} condition for a thermal Hall effect previously derived for ordered magnets.

Abstract: A promising approach to attain long-distance coherent spin propagation is accessing topological spin-polarized edge states in graphene. Achieving this without external magnetic fields necessitates engineering graphene band structure, obtainable through proximity effects in van der Waals heterostructures. In particular, proximity-induced staggered potentials and spin-orbit coupling are expected to form a topological bulk gap in graphene with gapless helical edge states that are robust against disorder. In this work, we detect the spin-polarized helical edge transport in graphene at zero external magnetic field, allowed by the proximity of an interlayer antiferromagnet, CrPS$_4$. We show the coexistence of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) states and magnetism in graphene, where the induced spin-orbit and exchange couplings also give rise to a large anomalous Hall (AH) effect. The detection of the QSH states at zero external magnetic field, together with the AH signal that persists up to room temperature, opens the route for practical applications of magnetic graphene in quantum spintronic circuitries.

Abstract: Magnon dynamics in skyrmion lattices have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in topological magnonics. Existing theories often follow a single-momentum approach, assuming significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) to minimize the skyrmion's dimensions, which can lead to oversimplification in describing magnon behavior. This study introduces a multi-momentum operator theory for magnons in large 2D skyrmions, where each skyrmion encompasses several thousand spins. The proposed theory fully transforms the magnon Hamiltonian into momentum space, incorporating off-diagonal terms to capture umklapp scattering caused by the skyrmion wave vectors. Our results reveal deviations from single-momentum theories, demonstrating that flat bands are not universal features of the skyrmionic magnon spectrum. Additionally, we find that manipulating the skyrmion size with an external magnetic field induces multiple topological phase transitions. At high magnetic fields, the low-energy magnon spectrum becomes densely packed and entirely topological, resembling a topological band continuum.

Abstract: Understanding surface collective dynamics in quantum materials is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. For example, surface phonon modes in quantum paraelectrics are thought to play an essential role in facilitating interfacial superconductivity. However, detecting these modes, especially below 1 terahertz (THz), is challenging due to limited sampling volumes and the need for high spectroscopic resolution. Here, we report surface soft transverse optical (TO1) phonon dynamics in KTaO3 and SrTiO3 by developing surface-sensitive spintronic THz spectroscopy that can sense the collective modes only a few nanometers deep from the surface. In KTaO3, the TO1 mode softens and sharpens with decreasing temperature, leveling off at 0.7 THz. In contrast, this mode in SrTiO3 broadens significantly below the quantum paraelectric crossover and coincides with the hardening of a sub-meV phonon mode related to the antiferrodistortive transition. These observations that deviate from their bulk properties may have implications for interfacial superconductivity and ferroelectricity. The developed technique opens opportunities for sensing low-energy surface excitations.

Abstract: We present an ultrafast thermodynamics framework to model heat generation and entropy production in laser-driven ferromagnetic systems. By establishing a connection between the magnetic field strength of the laser pulse and magnetization dynamics we model time-dependent entropy production rates and deduce the associated heat dissipation in epitaxial and polycrystalline FeNi and CoFeB thin films. Our theoretical predictions are validated by comparison to experimental magnetization dynamics data, shedding light on thermodynamic processes on picosecond timescales. Crucially, we incorporate recently observed inertial spin dynamics, to describe their impact on heat generation in pump-probe experiments. As such, this formalism provides novel insights into controlling heat production in magnetic systems, and contributes to advancing the understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in magnetic systems, with implications for future experimental protocols in spintronics and nanotechnology.

# On Heterogeneous Ising Machines

arXiv:2410.23517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines are effective solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems. The idea is mapping the optimal solution(s) to a combinatorial optimization problem to the minimum energy state(s) of a physical system, which naturally converges to and stabilizes at a minimum energy state upon perturbance. The underlying mathematical abstraction, the Ising model, was originally developed to explain dynamic behavior of ferromagnetic materials and was shown to generalize to numerous other physical systems. In a generic optimization problem, each variable can interact with another in different ways. At the same time, problem sizes of practical importance are growing very fast. Unfortunately, both the number and connectivity of spins in hardware are subject to fundamental physical limits. Different problems feature different interaction patterns between variables which may not always directly match the network topology supported by a specific Ising machine. In the presence of a mismatch, emulating generic interactions using the machine topology is usually possible, however, comes at the cost of additional physical spins to facilitate the mapping. Furthermore, mismatches in the problem vs. hardware connectivity render even more physical spins necessary. Combinatorial optimization problems of practical importance come with diverse connectivity patterns, which a rigid network topology in hardware cannot efficiently cover. To bridge the gap between application demand and hardware resources, in analogy to classical heterogeneous chip multiprocessors, in this paper we make the case for heterogeneous Ising multiprocessors, where each Ising core features a different connectivity. We provide a detailed design space exploration and quantify the efficiency of different design options in terms of time or energy to solution along with solution accuracy compared to homogeneous alternatives.
